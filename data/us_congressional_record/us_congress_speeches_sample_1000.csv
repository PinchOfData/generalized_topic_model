It was my privilege to discuss whether to pay traveling expenses was increasing the emoluments of the President when the act of 1906 was passed. and in arguing that question then I saw fit to cite authorities from learned courts and not to depend upon my own legal opinion for the vindication of the proposition that it was lawful to appropriate money for the traveling expenses of the President of the United States. I do want to briefly answer this charge of bad faith. The legislative bill carried the usual appropriation of $50.000. The sundry civil bill as reported carried the appropriation for traveling expenses. but before the sundry civil bill was considered in this Chamber the Senate had amended the legislative bill so as to give the President $100.000 in .payment for his salary and his traveling expenses. In view of the pendency of that proposition. we in the House struck out from the sundry civil bill the proposed appropriation for traveling expenses. When that proposition came up to increase the salary of the President. I voted against it at all times. I was not ih favor of raising the salary of the President. but I have always been in favor of paying his traveling expenses. in order that he might go to all parts of the country and be in closer touch with the people. Now. let us see whether anybody got deceived on the other side of the House on the occasion of the passing of the legislative bill through the House on the 3d day of last March. I read from the RECORD of that day:\n',purpose discuss legality proposition privilege discuss pay traveling_expense increase emolument act pass argue question see_fit cite authority learn court depend own legal opinion vindication proposition lawful appropriate money travel expense want answer charge bad faith legislative bill carry usual appropriation sundry_civil bill report carry appropriation travel expense sundry_civil bill consider amend legislative bill give salary travel expense view pendency proposition strike sundry_civil bill propose appropriation travel expense proposition come increase salary vote time ih favor raise salary favor pay travel expense order go part country close touch people let see get deceive other side occasion passing legislative bill 3d day last read record,61.0,bound,1,0

House passage of this rule and of the bill already approved by the other body will send the measure to the President. And I would respectfully request of the President that he allow this bill to become law. Members should be aware that a number of changes to the Housepassed. bill were made in the other body. Th most important addition is relief for the domestic footwear industry. The bill now provides footwear imports with a 60percent share of the American market. while reserving 40 percent to our American industry. This is reasonable and justified to save an important American industry that is fighting for its life. In regard to the main part of the bill. the textile and apparel import quotas. import penetration is granted up to about 42 percent of the domestic market. with 58 percent reserved for our American manufacturers. This is certainly generous to our foreign competitors while at the same time allowing our own American textile and apparel industry to survive. Mr. Speaker. despite everything that has been said against this bill. a review of its provisions will show it to be a fair and reasonable bill which gives a generous share of our domestic market to our foreign competitors. The bill is a lifeline to our own textile and apparel industry which is going under. in my judgment. unless we enact this bill into law. We have seen a 65 percent surge in imports in the past 2 years. and 300.000 jobs have been lost since 1979. Imports now comprise 50 percent of the American clothing market. Enough is enough. I ask my colleagues to lend a helping hand to an industry employing almost 2 million workers that has reinvested its capital and has made every effort to modernize its equipment and its business practices. I ask you to vote for this rule and for this billto vote for America. And Mr. President. I ask you to allow this reasonable and fair bill to become law. I ask you. Mr. President. not to forget our own people. not to sacrifice them on the altar of a trade policy that is more theory than reality. A national trade policy that turns a blind eye to the destruction of great American industries is not my idea of an intelligent policy. and I hope it is not yours. Mr. President.

I am today introducing legislation which provides for a $100 million emergency loan to the Rock Island Railroad so that it may maintain its essential services to the Midwest. In the absence of a loan from the USRA. the Rock Island has been forced to declare bankruptcy and may now be forced to embargo on May 15. If an embargo is indeed declared. the ICC will issue a service order which will cost the taxpayer in the neighborhood of $60 million over an 8month period. Unfortunately. the funds issued under such an order would be used only to prevent the disruption of service and would not provide money to rebuild the many miles of track which are in a dangerous state of disrepair. The failue of a service order to provide for reconstruction only increases the possibility of further disrupted service and injury or death to the employees of the railroad. The job security of the Rock Island employees must be given top consideration. I have received countless letters. telegrams. and phone calls from employees who are consumed by the fear of losing their jobs. If the Rock Island discontinues operations and its services are divided among existing carriers. the services of the vast majority of its employees would be terminated. In my district alone. the Rock Island employs approximately 1.500 workers. They and their families are faced with the devastating reality of losing their jobs at a time when jobs are hard to come by. It is also important to note that at a time when the President and Congress have encouraged our farmers to produce at full capacity. farmers and other agriculturerelated businesses dependent on the railroad may face serious difficulties in transporting their products. Although many Rock Island mainlines duplicate those of other railroads. the Rock Island is the only railroad which serves hundreds of communities and stations in the Midwest. According to the ICC. for example. 733 grain elevators are served exclusively by the Rock Island. It is my hope that the committee charged with considering this legislation will recognize the serious ramifications of inaction and work promptly to insure the continuation of the Rock Island Railroad.\n',today introduce legislation provide emergency loan maintain essential service absence loan force declare bankruptcy force embargo embargo declare issue service order cost taxpayer neighborhood 8month_period fund issue order use prevent disruption service provide money rebuild many mile track dangerous state disrepair failue service order provide reconstruction increase possibility disrupt service injury death employee railroad job security employee give top consideration receive countless letter telegram phone call employee consume fear lose job discontinue operation service divide exist carrier service vast_majority employee terminate district employ worker family face devastating reality lose job time job hard come important note time encourage farmer produce full capacity farmer other agriculturerelated business dependent railroad face serious difficulty transport product many mainline duplicate other railroad only railroad serve hundred community station accord example grain_elevator serve hope committee charge consider legislation recognize serious ramification inaction work insure continuation,94.0,bound,1,0

They are exceedingly expensive to maintain in comparison to their power.

Japan is building four battle cruisers and one Drcadnought. indicating that her plan is to have in the future a fleet of greater speed than our fleet by four. five. or six knots. That would enable her. if she has a weapon that can fire at long range. and this indicates that she has a shell that would not be required to penetrate the armor after it strikes. a shell using explosives in large weights. then she could practically stay out where the lighter armor of her ships would be as much a defense against our fire as the heavier armor of our ships against their fire. Then. they would have the additional speed to enable them to take their location at the front and cap our fleet. and we would be placed at a very serious disadvantage.\n',keep many old battleship battle line tactical unit lack number new ship old ship low speed new battleship retard new battle fleet impair effectiveness ship reserve expensive maintain comparison power addition new ship instance year enable toput old battleship commission put reserve simple question efficiency integrity exist make effective make specific comparison illustration build battle_cruiser indicate plan future fleet great speed fleet knot enable weapon fire long range indicate shell require penetrate_armor strike shell use explosive large weight stay light armor ship much defense fire heavy armor ship fire additional speed enable take location front cap fleet place serious disadvantage.\n,62.0,bound,0,1

States would have to provide AFDC benefits to twoparent families with dependent children in which the principal wageearner in unemployed. Participation in the two parent AFDC Program has historically been an option for States. Many. including Texas. opted out of participation. Now we are saying. in the House passed versionthat States must participate. Texas must. the law says. now spend as much as $23 million on a program it has chosen notto be partof. This. Mr. Speaker. is not the kind of quality control on welfare that the American people want. In fact. it is just the opposite. The Senate amendments delete this unnecessary provision. returning the AFDC Program to its original state. The Senate amendments leave States rights and State decisions where they belongin the State.

This does not mean that we can shift burdens onto our State and local governments. This does not mean that we should be increasing the scope of our welfare system. We must remember.

This is a House bill. and we hope to make only amendments which will be accepted by the House without the necessity of a conference. We have been informed that if new subject matter makes it necessary to have a conference. the whole bill may be defeated. The principal object of H.R. 8140 is to improve the current conflict of interest laws. most of which were first enacted in the 19th century. As now written. they are confusing. inadequate in certain respects. too sweeping in other respects and. in general. fail to meet the needs of presentday Government. The shortcomings of these statutes have been pointed out in recent years by various committees of the Congress. by the executive branch and by organizations of the bar. Each of these groups has found the underlying principles of the statutes to be sound but has at the same time noted the need for their revision in the interests of clarification and modernization. This bill embodies the most important of the recommended changes in present law which were submitted by the President with his special message of April 27. 1961. on conflicts of interest and standards of conduct in the Government. In addition to the support of the administration. the bill has the support of the American Bar Association and the Association of the Bar of the City of New York. The New York City Association made an invaluable report in 1960 on the subject of the Federal conflict of interest laws and many of its recommendations have been written into the bill. Every witness who appeared at the hearings held by the Senate and House Judiciary Committees favored the enactment of the bill. As far as I know. no opposition to it has been voiced from any quarter. Although the Judiciary Committee made a number of amendments. I have no doubt they are acceptable to the House of Representatives. The bill has three main purposes in connection with the conflict statutes: First. it strengthens certain of them by increasing the range of the Government matters in which activities giving rise to conflicts of interest are prohibited. As as result of judicial construction these statutes are presently regarded as prohibiting activities in connection with ""claims against the Government"" for money or property only. The bill would extend their scope to include the vast range of administrative proceedings and other similar matters which comprise a great part of the work of the Government departments and agencies today. The bill also strengthens present law by imposing a permanent bar. rather than the present 2year bar. against a former Government employees representing a private party in connection with a specific matter in which the former employee had participated personally while working for the Government. The second main purpose of H.R. 8140 is to clarify and simplify the existing statutes. It should be noted. however. that in certain respects it makes no significant changes. Thus. the two provisions applying to Members of Congress do not make any changes of susbtance in the corresponding provisions of the present law. One. in section 203 of the bill. prohibits the receipt of compensation by Members of Congress for representing others before the agencies of the Government. The other. section 204. prohibits Members of Congress from practicing in the Court of Claims. Similarly. the bill leaves untouched the two present sections of the conflicts statutes which pertain specifically to retired officers of the Armed Forces. The third main purpose of H.R. 8140 is to facilitate the Governments recruiting of skilled persons from private fields to serve it on an intermittent or temporary basis. At the same time. the bill affords the Government adequate protection against conflicts of interest on the part of such persons. This dual purpose is achieved by creating in section 202 a category of Government employees designated ""special Government employees"" who are not subject to the full extent of the prohibitions applicable to the ordinary Government employee. This category is composed of employees. whether compensated or not. who serve not more than 130 days during any period of 365 consecutive days either on a fulltime or intermittent basis. Passing now to a summary of the provisions of H.R. 8140. I believe it will be helpful to describe first their impact on the regular Government employee. He would be subject to four major conflictof -interest restrictions under the bill. He would in general be prohibited from representing any other person in relation to any transaction involving the Government. The regular employee also would be prohibited from participating in a transaction involving the Government in the consequences of which he. his spouse. minor child or business associates have a significant financial interest. Private sources would be prohibited from paying or supplementing his salary for his Government services. Finally. after leaving the Government service. he would be prohibited from representing another person in relation to any transaction involving the Government in which he participated personally and substantially as a Government employee. He would also in general be barred for 1 year following his Government employment from representing anyone in a matter in an area where he had had official responsibility at any time during his last year in the Government. The special Government employee would be prohibited from representing other persons only. first. in matters involving the Government in which he has participated personally and substantially and. second. if he serves an agency more than 60 days a year. in matters pending before that agency. As to participation in transactions involving the Government in the consequences of which he. his spouse. minor child or business associates have a financial interest. the special Government employee would be subject to the same restrictions as a regular employee. Similarly. the postemployment prohibitions applicable to a regular Government employee would apply equally to the special Government employee. However. the latter would not be subject to the restrictions against outside compensation applicable to the regular employee. A secondary purpose of H.R. 8140 is to consolidate into a single section--section 201of Governmentwide applicability the gist of the various existing bribery statutes which apply separately to particular categories of Government officials and to Jurors and witnesses (18 U.S.C. 201213). This consolidation makes no significant changes of substance and would not narrow the broad sweep of the current bribery laws. Finally. the bill would add to ""any other remedies provided by law"" an authorization for the Government to void any contract or other transaction In relation to which there has been a final conviction under the bribery or conflictofinterest statutes. H.R. 8140 is the result of years of discussion and study. and its provisions are endorsed by the experts in the fields it covers. It is designed to promote the public interest by affording the Government the protection it requires and simultaneously making it possible for the Government to obtain services it requires. The need for the bill is undisputed. and I urge that it be passed by the Senate promptly in order to permit Its enactment this session. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent to have printed at this point in the RECORD a summary of H.R. 8140 which was prepared by the Department of Justice. It is an excellent analysis of the bill\n'",assure distinguished agree bad abuse bill hope make only amendment accept necessity conference inform new subject matter make necessary conference whole bill defeat principal object improve current conflict interest law most enact 19th_century write confusing inadequate certain respect sweeping other respect general fail meet need shortcoming statute point recent year various committee executive_branch organization bar group find underlying principle statute sound same time note need revision interest clarification modernization bill embody important recommend change present law submit special message conflict interest standard conduct addition support administration bill support make invaluable report subject conflict interest law many recommendation write bill witness appear hearing hold favor enactment bill know opposition voice quarter make number amendment doubt acceptable bill main purpose connection conflict statute strengthen certain increase range government matter activity give rise conflict interest prohibit result judicial construction statute regard prohibit activity connection claim government money property bill extend scope include vast range administrative proceeding other similar matter comprise great part work department agency today bill strengthen present law impose permanent bar present bar former employee represent private party connection specific matter former employee participate work second main purpose clarify simplify exist statute note certain respect make significant change provision apply member make change susbtance correspond provision present law section bill prohibit receipt compensation member represent other agency other section prohibit practice bill leave untouche present section conflict statute pertain retire officer third main purpose facilitate government recruit skilled person private field serve intermittent temporary basis same time bill afford adequate protection conflict interest part such person dual purpose achieve create section category employee designate special employee subject full extent prohibition applicable ordinary employee category compose employee compensate serve more day period consecutive day fulltime intermittent basis pass summary provision believe helpful describe impact regular employee subject major conflictof_-inter restriction bill general prohibit represent other person relation transaction involve regular employee prohibit participate transaction involve consequence spouse minor child business associate significant financial interest private source prohibit pay supplement salary service leave service prohibit represent person relation transaction involve participate government employee general bar year follow employment represent matter area official responsibility time last year special employee prohibit represent other person matter involve participate serve agency more day year matter pende agency participation transaction involve consequence spouse minor child business associate financial interest special employee subject same restriction regular employee postemployment prohibition applicable regular employee apply special employee latter subject restriction outside compensation applicable regular employee secondary purpose consolidate single section section 201of applicability gist various exist bribery statute apply particular category official witness consolidation make significant change substance narrow broad sweep current bribery law bill add other remedy provide law authorization void contract other transaction relation final conviction bribery conflictofinter_statute result year discussion study provision endorse expert field cover design promote public interest afford protection require make possible obtain service require need bill undisputed urge pass order permit enactment session ask_unanimous consent print point record summary prepare excellent analysis bill\n,87.0,bound,0,1

I rise in support of H.R. 3732. the Budget Process Reform Act of This legislation will permit us to respond to the changes that have occurred over the last year. Where it is strategically prudent. we can and must begin cutting the defense budget. In the postcold war era. we are faced with new opportunities and new challenges. We must have budget rules that allow us to develop policies which help forge a new direction for our country. One that allows us to say we care about jobs. we care about education. we care about health care. and we care about this Nations future. We can and we will make sensible judgments about investment in strategic systems and our industrial base. But. we can no longer operate under budget rules which arbitrarily classify programs and impose irrational bar.riers: the budget walls maximize politics over sound economic investment and strategic decisionmaking. For over 40 years. America invested a substantial portion of its resources into winning the cold war. Today. we must invest in America. After a decade of neglect. we owe it to future generations to reverse the decline in our Nations infrastructure and resume our investment in both our physical and human resources through increased funding for education. health care. job training. research and development. investment incentives. housing. and infrastructure. To those who say we should use savings from defense to exclusively reduce the deficit. I say look at the facts: 1 in 10 Americans receives food stamps. in Rhode Island the unemployment rate is almost 8 percent. children make up 40 per cent of the poor. the United States ranks 24th in infant mortality rivaling many Third World nations. our immunization rates also mirror those of the Third World. 100.000 children go homeless each night. only 30 percent of eligible children can participate in Head Start Programs. more than 34 million Americans lack even the most basic health insurance. and American students are regularly listed at the bottom in international comparisons. America cannot succeed it we allow this neglect to continue. Indeed. unless we act now. the costs associated with more than a decade of neglect of our domestic economy will exacerbate the deficit. Today. we have the opportunity to free up resources to meet these needs without altering the deficit reduction targets included in the 1990 budget agreement. As a member of the Education and Labor Committee. I can tell you firsthand what breaking down the budget walls a year early will permit us to do. With no walls. we can increase funding for education by $3.7 billion. we can increase job training funds by $689 million over the 1992 level. we can increase Head Start by $800 million over the 1992 level. To those who say that decreasing the defense budget will mean economic hardship hereat home. I must disagree. We currently spend $28 billion for the operation and management of U.S. bases in Europe. If we were to cut half of this spending and/or negotiate burden sharing agreements with our affluent allies. we could prevent layoffs at home. Or we could use these resources to develop job training programs for laidoff defense workers. conversion assistance for impacted communities. and innovative financing and marketing assistance to help defense contractors diversify. With the walls. up. there will be meager resources for such efforts. The Commerce Department and its economic development administration will never have the dollars to assist conversion efforts. unless the walls come down. I know many Rhode Islanders are concerned about the future of the Seawolf submarine. Throughout my State there has been much discussion of the Presidents proposal to rescind funding for the second and third Seawolf submarines. While I am also concerned. this legislation has nothing to do with the recisionit would only affect fiscal year 1993. not fiscal year 1991 or fiscal year 1992. Indeed. the contract for the fiscal year 1991 boat has already been awarded to Electric Boat and this contract was recently approved by the Fourth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond. VA. I believe the Seawolf is a necessary bridge to our next generation of attack submarines. Continuation of this program will maintain our -industrial base and stimulate technological advancements in submarine construction. That the Presidents proposal to terminate the Seawolf is hasty and shortsighted has been bolstered by the recent Navy report on maintaining our industrial base. Although this report is strongly in favor of submarine procurement to protect our submarine construction capabilities. it is also an obvious attempt to come up with an after the fact justification for the Presidents rash proposal. Our country is entering a period of transition. The military confrontation of the past has been replaced by the challenge of international economic competition. We must have a budget that outlines a vision and a sense of leadership so that we can transform the challenges we face today into future opportunities. We must have budget rules which help us create a robust economy and a humane society which exemplifies *the goals and aspirations of our country. The current budget agreement does not permit this. The time has come to bring down the budget walls so we can meet the challenges ahead. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n',rise support legislation permit respond change occur last year prudent begin cut defense budget era face new opportunity new challenge budget rule allow develop policy help forge new direction country allow say care job care education care health_care care future make sensible judgment investment strategic system industrial base operate budget rule classify program impose irrational bar.rier budget wall maximize politic sound economic investment strategic decisionmaking year invest substantial portion resource win cold war today invest decade neglect owe future generation reverse decline infrastructure resume investment physical human resource increase funding education health job training research development investment incentive housing infrastructure say use saving defense reduce deficit say look fact receive food_stamp unemployment rate percent child make cent poor rank 24th infant_mortality rival many nation immunization rate mirror child go homeless night percent eligible child participate more lack basic health insurance american student list bottom international comparison succeed allow neglect continue act cost associate more decade neglect domestic economy exacerbate deficit today opportunity free resource meet need alter deficit reduction target include budget agreement member tell break budget wall year permit wall increase funding education increase job training fund level increase level say decrease defense budget mean economic hardship hereat home disagree spend operation management basis cut half spending negotiate burden share agreement affluent ally prevent layoff home use resource develop job training program laidoff defense worker conversion assistance impact community innovative financing marketing assistance help defense contractor diversify wall meager resource such effort economic development administration dollar assist conversion effort wall come know many concerned future submarine state much discussion proposal rescind funding second third submarine concern legislation recisionit affect fiscal year fiscal year fiscal year contract fiscal year boat award contract approve believe necessary bridge next generation attack submarine continuation program maintain -industrial base stimulate technological_advancement submarine construction proposal terminate hasty shortsighted bolster recent report maintain industrial base report favor submarine procurement protect submarine construction capability obvious attempt come fact justification rash proposal country enter period transition military confrontation past replace challenge international economic competition budget outline vision sense leadership transform challenge face today future opportunity budget rule help create robust economy humane society exemplify goal aspiration country current budget agreement permit time come bring budget wall meet challenge urge colleague support legislation.\n,102.0,daily,0,1
790113415,S,19451101,164,Mr. CHAVEZ,Unknown,CHAVEZ,Unknown,M,5084,5457,11011945.txt,14365,953,79096401,CHAVEZ,DENNIS,S,NM,M,D,,voting,"Mr. President. today I have heard quite a debate on tax matters. The average American knows very little about taxes. except that he has to pay them. I am in receipt of a letter dealing with American fundamentals of which every American knows. I wish to take a little of the time of the Senate to read the letter. It is addressed to me. and reads as follows: WooDsIDE. QuEnNs. N. Y.. October 29. 1945. Senator DENNIS CS.AvEz. United States Senate. WashLington. D. C. DEaR SENATOR CHAVEZ: On the eve of election. November 6. 1944. my former Commander in Chief. Franklin Delano Roosevelt. said: ""When the ballots are cast your responsibilities do not cease. The public servants you elect cannot fulfill their trust unless. you. the people. watch and advise them. Raise your voices in protest when you believe your public servants to be wrong. back them up when you believe them to be right."" Recently. President Truman said these historic words: ""Today we stand on the threshold of a new world. We must do our part in making this world what it should be. a world in which the bigotries of race and class and creed shall not be permitted to warp the souls of men."" These words are not highsounding empty phrases spoken to lull the people into deceptively peaceful sleep. These words have life and meaning. They are the essence of democratic government. which is defined best as ""government of the people. by the people. and for the people""-all the people. not just a chosen few. I am an American who believes in the ideals of Abraham Lincoln and Robert E. Lee. I raise my voice in protest against the vicious discriminatory religious and racial hate. as spouted by some of the more reactionary citizens of America. I am an average American citizen whose only claim to prominence is a lone 16 days of picketing in Washington. D. C. I would not have interrupted my selfimposed picketing duty were it not for the fact that my leg wounCs. incurred in the Pacific battle of Savo Bay aboard the cruiser Vincennes. made continuous action impossible. . My parents were poor Polish immigrants who came to this country In search of what did not exist in Europe. In their labored English they told me that the United States represented promise and hope to all who suffer in dull. throbbing defeat. They understood America. understood it far better than these same reactionaries. some of whom are descended from generations of nativeborn Americans. I grew. up in New Yorks lower east side. where all the ingredients of the melting pot that is America are fused into a most won.derful country. I studied and played with Italians. Jews. Irish. Negroes. and others whom some persons would dismiss as ""undesirable nationalities."" As I was not important. wealthy. or aristocratic. I was only an unimportant. poor. ignorant kidI called my friends Americans and they thought of me as an American. too. Of course. there were plenty of street.gang fights. Children in poor. crowded slums need some form of activity. My head was once bashed in for defending a Jewish lad in a gang scrap. Eut those kids and their parents would neve: have listened and believed In some speakers with their blind prejudices. I enlisted in the Navy on August 2. 1940. I knew that a war against fascism was inevitable and I wanted to fight it from the beginning. I did not know that the Hitlerian shoots I was helping to destroy were already transplanted to my own cuntry. and were now trying to choke and invalidate the very thing we were fighting for. As pharmacists mate on the U. S. S. Vincennes. a heavy cruiser which participated in the battles of Coral Sea. Midway. Guadalcanal. and Savo Bay in the Solomon Islands. I served with other Americans. men whose origins were Negro. Jewish. Irish. Italian. Hungarian. Polish. and Greek. They lived. fought. and died togetherfor the United States of America. their country. Let me tell you two short storiesincidents that prove to me a mans a man. regardless of his face. creed. color. or national origin. During the battle of Savo Bay the left arm of a Negro boy aboard the Vincennes was shattered by shrapnel. I applied a tourniquet. did what else I could for him and left him to look after the other wounded men. When I returned. he was not lying therehe was on the line passing ammunition with his one good arm. That man is dead nowhe gave his life for America and the preservation of democracy. Another lad. his chest crushed by a piece of shrapnel. was hurt so badly that nothing could be done for him except to make his last minutes as comfortable as possible. I gave him something to dull the pain and he died soon afterward. His dead hand dropped open and in it was a Star of David and a picture of a pretty girl holding a chubby. smiling baby. He never saw his son. This boy died for America and the promises it must make and keep to his child. Shall these promises be abrogated by any unintelligent persons today? Should such men be called ""niggers"" or ""kikes? It was they who kept this country free. Should anyone speak against them? I saw boys suffer and I looked at the dead faces of many more. And out of my wide experience with death. I would like to say that a pure southern white and a Negro or a Jew or an Italian die for the same reasons and show the same physical manifestations in death. Negro blood and white blood have exactly the same chemical makeup. All blood congeals in death. Black and white limbs grow equally stiff. Italian and Negro hearts stop beating as tragically as southern hearts. The screams and grimaces of dying men have nothing to do with their origins. They are men. human beings. simply that. nothing less. nothing more. And that is enough. The Vincennes was bombed and sunk on August 9. 1942. I did not abandon ship when the order was given because I had a duty to my wounded shipmates. I stayed at my battle station and administered first aid to my fallen comrades. While engaged in my tasks. I was hit by shrapnel and received serious wounds. Including a compoun. fricture of the left leg in four placesan injury from which I shall never recover completely. I crawled through the warm blood of Negroes. Italians. Jewsthe blood of Americans. Incidentally. only 30 percent of the Negroes on our ship survived. They all died for something many of them had never had in lifea way of living which did not exclude them from the things which all men should regard as their due. I would not be alive today were it not for the 4 pints of blood plasma. I do not know whether it waL Jewish blood. Christian blood. white or Negro blood. All I know is that it saved my life and I am thankful to any American regardless of his race. creed. color. or religion. because perhaps his blood flows in my veins. If any bigoted person ever visited the ""blood bank"" perhaps I have his blood in my veinsthat would be most ironic. I spent the next 3 years in naval hospitals. During this time the Navy sometimes sent me out to make warbond and blocdplasma speeches. Most of my days. however. were spent in the hospital. Here I met. talked to. and lived with other wounded men. We had plenty of time to think and to read the newspapers. I have seen tears come to the eyes of my sick buddies when they read some of this terrible hate propaganda. ""Was this what we fought for?"" ""Was this why my arm or leg was thrown aside? God. if this is true. what a horrible waste its all been."" Thats what those silent teais said to me. After my discharge from the St. Albans Naval Hospital. I decided to speak out against all hateful prejudices and attacks. In my picket line. I carried a sign reading ""Was it in vain that I fought for democracy?"" I had no response except someone sent me a book of speeches--not even autographed. It wasnt easy or pleasant to walk up and down the street in front of the place I have chosen to picket. My leg cannot stand that much exercise very well. I was annoyed by questions about the ""organization"" I represented. I do not and never have represented any formally organizzd group. I was a lone American demanding the fruits of democracy for himself and 133.000.000 other Americans. If victory is to have more than a mere military connotation. we must see that discrimination against minority races and groups is no longer tolerated in speech or act. I intend to keep doing my part. Others are joining me. Our voices are clear and 4ure. We are going to fight intolerance wherever we find it. We will expose intolerance in Catholic. Protestant. or Jew. We will organize and expcse it in New York and in California and In Mississippi and in all the other States. up and down and across the land. I have received hundreds of letters from servicemen and civilians. All except two congratulated me on my stand. And if I could talk to the two who were on the other side. perhaps I could make them understand that something like Mr. Wilikies One World is the alternative to no world at all. We face a serious problem in the returning veteran who might listen to any persons Fascist foaming. There will be emotional. economic. and social maladuetment. Twisted. bitter hearts may respond to their cynical. vicious talk. They may become eager to ""put the nigger in his place."" Impatient. hungry men are seldom logical or progressive. I know nothing about politics. 1 have never sought or held office. I am a leader only in the sense that I am not afraid to speak for millions of others. Their voices are blended in mine. I quote from some of the letters I. received during my stay in Washington: 1. ""I read with interest the account in the newspapers of your oneman fight. It was about time someone had enough guts to tell what the servicemen think and r admire your courage for being the first. You have become the spokesman for all the fellows In service. and you can be sure that were all behind you 100 percent. I sincerely hope that you are only the first of thousands of GIs who will come home and campaign actively for the Americanism that weve been fighting for."" 2. ""By the time this letter reaches you. if it ever should. I feel confident that your call for exservicemen to aid you will have been answered by many others like yourself. I know that if it were possible. I and countless others still in service who have read of your campaign. would be right there beside you because most of us feel with you."" ""Perhaps this letter should be in a vein of thanks. to express in some way the gratitude of all of us to you for representing those who are unable to join you other than to lean on our pens as a means toward silencing those in America who are creating racial and religious intolerance. those here at home who pit black against white. Jew against Gentile. those who have forgotten and forgiven Tojo and Hitler just as surely as we havent."" ""From Tokyo. from Germany. from wherever Americans are. they are with you in heart because they cannot be with you in person.: 3. ""The WIVES. Inc.. an organization of women of every faith. creed. and color. whose husbands have fought and died in every branch of the armed forces for preservation of the democratic ideals. want to express their gratitude for the magnificent stand you are now making."" 4. ""Our country needs more and more men like you who have the courage publicly to condemn what threatens the public welfare. It takes a rare audacity of spirit to dare to make oneself conspicuous in the public interest. and I salute you for displaying It. ""Our son died in this war knowing very well. despite his youth. that what he fought for was the brotherhood of man. and that the fight must be fought at home as well as abroad. ""My husband joins me in admiration of your stand. and in pleasure in the knowledge that. whether he admits it or not * * * will know from now on that he cannot unchallenged attack the basic Idea of Americanism."" 5. A copy of a telegram was enclosed with this letter. It reads: ""Sixtyeight of us are sending $34 to Edward Bykowski. Although he has discouraged contributions. we hope it will enable him to continue picketing. We are servicemen of many racial strains who are strongly opposed to the antiracial prejudices."" 6. ""As a southern woman and a Democrat concerned about giving full opportunity to every human being. I want to cooperate with you in my small way. ""I am one of 130.000.000 citizens who want to thank you personally for offering your life for what you at least thought was a fight for human freedom. and I appreciate the way you continue to carry on the fight in the place it should have startedat home. ""May I take you to dinner while you continue this fight for me? Enclosed is the dollar for the check."" 7. ""Enclosed please find a money order for $5 to help you in your fight. which I trust you will accept In the spirit it is given by me. ""This is given in memory of our boy who died at Saipan. fighting like you and the rest of us for the cause. In my opinion. it is not fair that you alone should carry the expense. ""Too bad that we cant settle this matter the way it really should be settled."" Part of the money I received was given to the American Library Associationfor books for the libraries of all States. The balance is being used to carry on this fight against Intolerance and bigotry. John Galsworthy said. ""The measure of democracy is the measure of the freedom and sense of individual responsibility in its humblest citizens."" These letters and all the otherswritten to newspapers and Congressmen prove that the sense of individual responsibility is alive and fighting. And in a democracy. when the people fight. the people win. Too many of my ""kike."" ""dago."" and ""nigger"" friends are nothing now but crumbling bones under lonely white crosses and Jewish stars. What they died for must not die with them. It must live after them in the free thoughts and courageous speech of their childrens grandchildren. VEday and VJday were great and joyful days in our history. but we veterans are looking forward to a VAdaya victory in America day. We lived and fought for the day we could come back to peace. and instead. we read of Hitlerian doctrines. Politicians had better learn that if they try to destroy the ""work. laugh and live together"" philosophy. that is America. they will destroy themselves at the polls. America will win this war. too.

I will not take very much of the time. but I want to. on behalf of our delegation. thank the chairman of the committee. the gentleman from Mississippi [Mr. WzxrrzNI. and also the ranking member. the gentleman from Massachusetts for the way In which they have expeditiously dealt with this problem. We are tonight one week from the earthquake. and yet we have made available to the people of California through direct appropriation. or by taking the ceiling off existing funds. $4 billion for loans to victims of the disaster in their homes or their businesses. to improve our transportation system. and simply to help out with the disazter victim in terms of their immediate needs in placing them in housing and providing them with food. It is a real testament to the willingness of the Congress to be responsive .to this disaster. I want to thank all members of the authorizing committee who cooperated with the Committee on Appropriations. and all our colleagues. This is a tremendous amount of good will that exists here on the floor this evening. and we are tremendously grateful. The ByrdHatfield amendment includes a provision that would raise the loan authority ceiling to $1.813.250.000. This is necessary to allow the expenditure of whatever amounts are necessary during sequestration and beyond. Because of sequestration. SBA loan authority is fixed at $237 million. But after the appropriation of the additional $500 million In the CR. SBA will have available for obligation or allocation a total of $1.813 billion (thats a result of $1 billion appropriated earlier in the year. $300 million In repayments and. again. the $500 million in the shortterm CR). Therefore. to permit the expenditure or allocation of the full $1.813 billion as needed. the loan ceil. lag has to be raised. How much of this funding will go to the earthquake victims? SBA currently estimates that the hurricane victims will need $600 million to $700 million of the $1.8 billion. There. fore. based on current estimates. the bill will make $1.2 billion to $1.1 billion available to the earthquake victims. As amended by the Senate. the CR will provide: $1.1 billion for FEMA. $1 billion for highways (provide 100 percent Federal funding of road Improvements Initiated within 180 days. provide funding for the repair of the bay bridge. lift the $100 million ceiling on how much a State can both receive and spend from the ER fund. and ensure that Californias normal highways allocation will not be affected). $500 mill~on for SBA disaster loans (lift the ceiling on SBA loans to $1.813 billion which will permit the earthquake victims to immediately be eligible for between $1.1 and $1.2 billion in SBA disaster loans). and $250 million In discretionary authority to the President for other Federal disaster relief efforts ($20 million of which would go to the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program. $8 million for USGS for earthquake Investigations and $12 million for additional efforts to Improve earthquake preparedness). Grand total: The bill directly appropriates an additional $2.05 billion for disaster relief programs and makes available between $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion In SBA disaster loan assistance to earthquake victims.\n',take much time want behalf delegation thank chairman committee gentleman ranking member gentleman way deal problem tonight week earthquake make available people direct appropriation take ceiling exist fund loan victim disaster home business improve transportation system help disazter victim term immediate need place housing provide food real testament willingness responsive disaster want thank member authorize committee cooperate colleague tremendous amount good will exist floor evening grateful amendment include provision raise loan authority ceiling necessary allow expenditure amount necessary sequestration_sequestration loan authority fix appropriation additional available obligation allocation total s result appropriate year repayment permit expenditure allocation full need loan raise much funding go earthquake victim estimate hurricane victim need base current estimate bill make available earthquake victim amend provide highway provide percent funding road initiate day provide funding repair lift ceiling much state receive spend fund ensure normal highway allocation affect mill ~ disaster loan lift ceiling loan permit earthquake victim eligible disaster loan discretionary authority other federal disaster relief effort go earthquake investigation additional effort improve earthquake preparedness total bill appropriate additional disaster relief program make available disaster loan assistance earthquake_victims.\n,101.0,daily,0,1

In fact there are two bills before the Senate. a bill from the Judiciary Committee and a bill from the Railroad Committee. Under my obligations as a Senator I cannot vote for either of those bills as they now are. The bill introduced by the Judiciary Committee. in my judgment. asserts power that does not belong to the legislative department of this Government. God forbid. sir. that I shall ever subscribe to the doctrine of the omnipstency of Congress. and. with a very high regard for the Judiciary Committee. I do not believe in their omniscience. A bill is bronght here and we are told. absolutely told. in words told that the wisdom of man is exhausted . this bill is to be taken with no ts crossed. no is dotted . the Judiciary Committee is potent enough to require its passage just as it is. Mr. President. in my judgment this bill is in violation of the Constitution of the United States. There has been a wheelbarrowload of decisions of courts brought here and not one that sustains the claim of the Judiciary Committee. I do not propose to consume much of the time of the Senate. and therefore I will lay down what I regard as the law as decided by one of the highest courts in the United States. as decided by one of the purest courts in the United States. In the first place. let me premise by saying that all the power possessed by Congress is by grant. and that grant is to be found in the Constitution of the United States. There is no otherpower possessed by Congress. and what is that power ? It is intimated. more than intinmated. that because the States of this Union are inhibited from passing a law impairing the obligation of coutracts. Congress can do that same violation of common sense and common justice. I have not beard my distinguished friend the Senator from Ohio claim that power. for he says he is a strictconstruetion. hardheaded democrat. I think I use his own language. Now. then. can Congress pass alaw impairing the obligation of aeontract? They seek to do it. The bill of the Judiciary Committee seeks to impair the obligation of a contract. as I will try to show before I get through. First. then. what is a contract? That is the first point in the legal propositions to which I direct the attention of the Senate. ""A contract within the Constitution of the United States is one relating to property or some objeetof value""-mark the language-"" which imposes an obligation capable in legal contemplation of being impaired."" That is a contract. relating to some object of value which imposesan obligation capable in legal contemplation ofbeing impaired. Now. I assume that there is an executed agreement between the Government of the United States and these two railroad companies. I assume that that agreement is executed. I assun that there are objects of value connected with that contract. Let me see whether I am right or not. If I am not right. I shall veto for the bill. If any Senator will disprove these propositions of law. I shall vote for the bill. No man has yet disproved then. Now. let us see what this agreement was. The United States said thisof course I have not the charter in my bandsthe United States said to these Pacilic Railroad Companies. "" If you will transport the munitions of war of the United States. taking half our transportation as payment presently. build this road. keep it in absolute repair. with all its material in order. then we will loan you so much money. tobe paid on a given. certain day. we in the mean time taking 5 per cent. of your net earnings and half the cost of the transportation you do for us."" There is an obligation of value: first a service to be performed by these companies. next a sum of money to be paid annually or semiannually for these companies. There isyourcontraetexeeuted. Have I not stated it correctly ? If I have not I should like to be corrected. because I have said that if these legal propositions fail me I shall vote for the bill. One other legal point I direct the attention of the Judiciary Committee to. ""A legislative enactment equivalent to a contract or agreement. which is perfected. requiring nothing further to be done in order to its entire completion. is a contract executed. and whatever rights are thereby created subsequent legislation cannot impair."" I desire an answer to that legal proposition. This is the argumentof the supreme court of Connecticut when giants occupied her bench. No greater or purer inen than Williams and Johnson and Huntington and Storrs ever sat. on a bench anywhere. I commend this law. for it runs on all fours with my claim. One other proposition. ""A legislative act in the nature of an executory contract. which is supported by valuable and sufficient consideration. creates an obligation which a subsequent legislature cannot impair."" These three propositions I submit to the Senate as the positions upon which I stand. and as an honorable man. as a man standing by the constituted rights of the people and of the corporations created by the Government. I cannot avoid these positions. ""Ab."" but says the Judiciary Committee. ""do you deny the right to do"" what? To repeal? It is in the charter. To amend? It is in the charter. ""Do you deny it?"" Certainly not. Whenever a corporation. the creature. of a legislative body. violates the agreement which it has made with. its creator. then the creator will take from it the power which he has. given it. and never under any other eleumstances. It never has. been done in the United States and never will be done.\n'",feel importance bill fact bill bill bill obligation vote bill bill introduce judgment assert power belong legislative department forbid subscribe_doctrine omnipstency high regard believe omniscience bill bronght tell tell word tell wisdom man exhausted bill take ts_cross dot potent require passage judgment bill violation wheelbarrowload_decision court bring one sustain claim propose consume much time lay regard law decide high court decide pure court first place let premise say power possess grant grant find otherpower possess power intimate intinmate inhibit pass law impair obligation coutract same violation common_sense common justice beard distinguished friend claim power say strictconstruetion hardheade think use own language pass alaw impair obligation aeontract seek bill seek impair obligation contract try show get contract first point legal proposition direct attention contract relate property language- impose obligation capable legal contemplation impair contract relate object value imposesan obligation capable legal contemplation ofbee impaired assume execute agreement railroad company assume agreement execute assun object value connect contract let see right right veto bill disprove proposition law vote bill man disprove let see agreement say thisof course charter bandsthe say transport munition war take transportation payment build road keep absolute repair material order loan much money pay give certain day mean time take cent net_earning cost transportation obligation value service perform company sum money pay company isyourcontraetexeeute state like correct say legal proposition fail vote bill other legal point direct attention legislative enactment equivalent contract agreement perfect require further do order entire completion contract execute right create subsequent legislation impair desire answer legal proposition giant occupy bench great purer inen sit bench commend law run four claim other proposition legislative act nature executory_contract support valuable sufficient consideration create obligation subsequent legislature impair proposition submit position stand honorable man man stand constitute right people corporation create avoid position say deny right repeal charter amend charter deny corporation creature legislative body violate agreement make creator creator take power give other eleumstance do done.\n,45.0,bound,0,1

Yet I am in full accord with what we have done in the way of helping the banks and the railroads and the insurance companies. We had to do that. I have no criticism to offer of the relief we have extended in those directions. But I repeat that in my opinion the local banks have not beenI do not like to use the word ""generous "". but they have not been fair with the municipalities. They have imposed burdens upon municipalities in the way of high rates of interest and conditions imposed that have been almost impossible for the officials to carry out. But we cannot permit these local divisions of government to break down. To my mind one of the most distressing things of the economic situation is what has happened to the schools of America. We have boasted in America that the pupil of the school is the cornerstone of our national idealism and of our national life. and yet we find schools everywhere under the necessity of shortening their terms. I think I read that Chicago has recently determined that it will shorten the term of school this year 2 or 3 weeks in order that that money may be saved. We cannot permit this to go on. I remember that the ordinance of 1787 stated that ""religion. morality. and knowledge being necessary to good government and the happiness of mankind. schools and the means of education shall forever be encouraged."" I think I have correctly quoted that immortal document. Yet we find in various municipalities and other political units schools are being closed because of the inability of those communities to cash in on the taxes assessed.

I thank you very much. and I thank the Senator from Minnesota for the time. Mr. President. if there is one Job that is difficult to do today it is to be a superintendent of public instruction in the State of California. Our classrooms are overcrowded. our supplies are not adequate. and the needs of our young people are burgeoning. I rise in support today of Dr. Thomas Payzant. President Clintons nominee to become Assistant Secretary for Elementary and Secondary Education. I am very proud of this. because Dr. Payzant. I believe. is one of the finest superintendents of public instruction in all of the United States of America. For the past 30 years. Dr. Payzant has served as an educator and as a superintendent of schools in virtually every region of the Nation. Since 1982. my State of California has benefited from his leadership. and he has lifted the San Diego Unified School District into Americas elite class of innovative learning communities. In December 1992. Dr. Payzant received the Harold McGraw. Jr.. Education Prize. which is one of the most prestigious awards in American education. He has just completed 10 years as superintendent of San Diego city schools. making him one of only three recent big city superintendents that have survived more than 10 yearscontract renegotiation. problems of dealing with the local school board. all the panoply of distress that cause urban superintendents of public instruction very often to go somewhere else. Leading the San Diego UnifiedSchool District is no exception to the problems. It is the eighth largest urban school district In America. and like many of the districts in my State. it has been going through some dramatic demographic changes and an extended period of declining resources. Despite these challenges. Dr. Payzant has guided the district around pitfalls that have frustrated improvement efforts in many other districts across the country. Let me give you an example: Through his efforts. San Diego has been recognized as one of the countrys best urban school districts and a model for other districts to follow. I remember when I was running for Governor and I said to the Department of Education in my city. ""Who is the best superintendent to go and see?"" They said. ""Go to San Diego. They are doing some of the most interesting educational work."" His reforms have produced awards and results. and let me give you some of them. Through the 1980s student achievement In reading. language arts. and math has improved steadily in San Diego. It is especially important to know that progress was made in beginning to close the achievement gap which exists between AfricanAmericans. Hispanics. Asians. and white students. During Dr. Payzants tenure. a core curriculum was implemented requiring all students to take rigorous courses in basic academic subjects. One of the things that I have found that has been the product of educOtion of the last. oh. I would say 15. 20 years. is that we have strayed away from teaching youngsters. the basic fundamentals. I submit to you. Mr. President. as I look out at these young faces of pages. I say if you do not have your basic fundamentals. if you cannot read and write. subtract. multiply. divide and add. recognize China on a map. or do the things that are necessary to get that fundamental education. I am convinced you cannot succeed in the workplace as it is today. It is that much of an imperative. Dr. Payzant has recognized this and he has provided the leadership that has stressed excellence in education. And that is something that we should never. never compromise. As a former big city mayor. I am especially impressed with his ability to bring many different people together from different economic. social. and racial environments and form a consensus and move the district on. rather than let the district get tied up in moribund indecision between various groups. Equally important. he is not only respected for his good administrative and leadership abilities. but for his personal integrity as well. Throughout his tenure in San Francisco. he has upheld his responsibility to educate our young people In the finest of traditions. Those traditions are excellence. learn your fundamentalsreading and writing and arithmetic. The children of San Diego are better off for the superintendency of Dr. Thomas Payzant. For these reasons. I urge your support of Thomas Payzant.

They can not have proceeded to such a point that the town sites are irrevocably fixed and can not be changed. But the general counsel very frankly states that under the law a railroad company can not acquire a town site. Under the act by which they get the right to go through these reservations they can go in and acquire a certain amount of land for stations. for terminals. for sidings. and for switches.

880262949,S,19640731,457,Mr. HRUSKA,Unknown,HRUSKA,Unknown,M,20885,21236,07311964.txt,12649,848,88101481,HRUSKA,ROMAN,S,NE,M,R,,voting,Mr. President. the purpose of the bill before us. H.R. 8864. is to increase the price of coffee. It has no other purpose. that is the sole aim and objective of this legislation. It should not be enacted. The means of attaining this objective are not direct. They are indirect and roundabout. Ostensibly. all we are asked to do is to grant certain authority to the executive branch in the regulation of coffee imports. in order to carry out the provisions of the International Coffee Agreement of 1962. This agreement. we have been told. is intended merely to stabilize coffee prices. However. our experience under it already has shown us what to expect. This agreement went technically into effect last December. Almost immediately the price leaped upward. The most commonly quoted grade of coffee is known as Santos 4s. During most of 1963. this grade of coffee fluctuated between 33 and 34 cents. By January of this year. it had increased to 48 cents and by March to 50 cents. In effect. the wholesale price of coffee was boosted up by 17 cents a pound. The United States is overwhelmingly the most important importer of coffee In the world. We absorb more than 50 percent of total world exports. and we produce practically none of our own. We bring in over 3 billion pounds a year. In effect. therefore. this unconscionable increase in the price of coffee. if it is sustained. will cost the American consumer better than $500 million per year. That is the effect of the International Coffee Agreement to date. to the extent to which it has been placed in effect. It is the purpose of H.R. 8864 to enable the President to enforce the provisions of this agreement. Now what is the purpose of such an arrangement? Why on earth should the United States join in a plan which will cost our own people an extra $500 million a year? The purpose of the whole scheme has been made crystal clear by the administration. This agreement is not something that has to do primarily with our economic problems. On the contrary. it is a matter of foreign policy. The purpose of the agreement is to help our friends in Latin America and Africa who produce coffeeand not just our friends. but any coffeeproducing country that is a member of the agreement. In other words. this is really just a disguised form of foreign aid. It is not a small item either. $500 million a year is nothing to pass over lightly and in fact we have no proof that the ultimate cost will not go higher. Mr. President. in a few days we shall be asked to act upon the foreign aid authorizing legislation for the coming year. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee has reported the bill. We have been told by the administration that sharp reductions have been made in the foreign aid program this year. that all the water and waste have been squeezed out. that a bare minimum program is all that the administration is asking. In the report by the Foreign Relations Committee. it is pointed out that the total appropriation requested for the coming year is $3.517 million. The committee proposes a nominal reduction of $50 million from the administrations request and the House has voted a reduction in the actual appropriation of only $200 million from that figure. It is true that this scale of authorization and appropriation for foreign aid is somewhat less than we have been used to. But now we are handed this proposal to add $500 million a year to our coffee bill. In effect this coffee scheme Is nothing more nor less than a tax on the housewifes grocery bill to divert aid to the underdeveloped countries through another channel. Furthermore. it is important to recognize that this is a very ineffective form of foreign aid. These hundreds of millions of dollars extra that we will pay will not go to help build up the productivity of the less developed countries. For the most part. they will not go to the poor or to relieve hardship and starvation. They will go primarily to the large landholders who own the coffee plantations. to the speculators and financial interests. and to the governments of the coffee countries who skim off a great part of any price increase through taxation. These will be the principal beneficiaries of any action of ours to tax our housewives for the benefit of those countries. The entire purpose of this agreement was well summed up during the hearings on the agreement itself before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. At that time. the distinguished chairman of the committee. Senator FULBRIGHT. said very candidly: It seems to me that to make an argument that this agreement is in the interest of the consumers is something less than frank. It is really in the interests of our national foreign policy. isnt it? * * * It is In the interest of our foreign policy like our foreign aid bill. Mr. President. this agreement has been presented to us as the means to stabilize the price of coffee. Again and again. in the hearings and in the public statements of administration spokesmen. we have been told that the objective of the agreement is to stop the decline in coffee prices and to stabilize the market. Last year. Secretary of State Rusk stated: The objectives of the new International Coffee Agreement is to stop the longterm decline in revenues from coffee exports by stabilizing prices at a level no lower than the general level of coffee prices in 1962. The President. in his message urging enactment of this bill. H.R. 8864. said: The purpose of the agreement. which I fully endorse. is to check the disastrous decline in coffee prices that began in 1955. by holding a floor under these prices at the general level prevailing in 1962. and to bring stability to coffee markets by preventing major fluctuations in price. Our own Committee on Foreign Relations said in its report on the agreement: The main purpose of the agreement is to prevent a further decline in the world price of coffee which has dropped more than 50 percent since 1954. the year of the alltime highest price. In all of these statements. the entire emphasis is on stabilizing the market and stopping the decline. Nothing is said about pushing the price up 50 percent. Nothing is said about taxing the American consumer an extra $500 million in order to provide an additional roundabout channel for the dispensing of foreign aid. Now we have learned that the agreement can actually be used to manipulate world coffee prices to our disadvantage. The reason is not hard to find. By the very terms of the agreement. the producing countries are practically invited to use it in that way. In effect. we have been delivered into the hands of our adversaries. That is so because the principal element in this arrangement is a system of quotas limiting the supply of coffee which can be placed on the market. In setting these quotas. each country which is a member of the agreement has a vote but the producing countries and the consuming countries vote separately. Although the United States takes 52 percent of the world exports. we have only a 40percent vote among the consuming countries -and of course no vote at all among the producing countries. The committee report argues that our interests within the International Coffee Council are well protected. The majority report of the Finance Committee states: The interests of the United States are protected by the fact that it will hold a minimum of 400 votes out of the total of 1.000 consumer votes in the International Coffee Council. the governing body of the agreement. and will also be a member of the executive board. Since practically all important decisions. such as adoption of the budget. establishment of the quotas. or the production control program. require a twothirds vote of the consumers and producers voting separately. the United States holds sufficient votes to prevent actions which might be considered adverse to our policy interests. to our business community. or to the American consumer. In spite of these soothing words. our own experience is to the contrary. Already the mechanism of the International Coffee Council has been used to exploit us. Late last year there were indications of a crop failure of the coffee crop in Brazil. It was widely recognized within the trade that a sharp price increase would occur unless the quota restrictions of the International Coffee Agreement were relaxed. On that basis. the International Coffee Council was asked to increase the quotas. Within the Council the other consuming countries all voted with the United States for at least a moderate increase in quotas. in order to prevent coffee prices from shooting upward. The producing countries. however. or at least some of them. looked on the matter very differently. Naturally they were not displeased that coffee prices were increased. They had no desire to check those increases. The quotas could not be increased without a vote in favor of such a change by twothirds of the votes of the producing countries. At the timelast fallthere was great pressure on the producing countries to increase the quotas. as a sop to American public opinion. Many of the wiser heads in the governments of the coffee countries recognized that there was danger of antagonizing the United States if coffee prices went up too sharply. They knew that at that time this bill. H.R. 8864. had not yet been enacted and they were afraid that it might not be enacted if the American housewife was sufficiently alarmed. On those grounds. a strong argument was made to the producing countries that even against their own selfinterest they increase the quotas and thus check the price riseat least this once. * After the U.S. Congress has passed the law. of course. it did not matter so much. We would. have given away most of our defenses. There would be little we could do except complain. But until this bill was passed. there was every reason for the coffee producing countries to be cautious. to play it safe. to hold the price of coffee down to reasonable levels. Even so. the U.S. diplomats and the representatives. from other consuming countries found it impossible to persuade the producing countries to vote a quota increase last fall. The chance for a price rise in the coffee market was just too tempting. A number of the principal coffee producing countries were persuaded to vote the increase but it received less than twothirds of the votes of the producing countries. Thus the quota increase was defeated. Certainly nothing could prove more clearly how defenseless we will be once this bill is passed. The producing countries have the votes. they have the control. and they will make the decisions. If they decide to impose restrictive quotas on the world coffee market to push up the price. there is no way we can block them. This bill provides in effect that we will supply the enforcement arm to make the provisions of the quota arrangement effective. The bill has two principal provisions. It provides that we may require certificates as to the country of origin for all the coffee imported here. The purpose of that provision is to make sure that we can enforce the quotas set under provisions of the agreement. Second. the bill provides that we may limit or stop imports from countries which are not members of the International Coffee Organization. The purpose of that is to force all coffee producing countries to belong to the organization or at least to conform to its policies. Thus the effect of enacting this bill is to make the U.S. Government the principal enforcing arm of the agreement. We take most of the coffee and unless we help enforce the quotas. the entire agreement would probably collapse. But by the terms of this legislation we would help the producing countries enforce their decisions against the interests of the American consuming public. In effect. we would help them levy this tax on the American consumer. to create this new form of foreign aid. Mr. President. in May 1963 when the International Coffee Agreement was before us. I opposed it. At that time. it seemed to me that this agreement created grave dangers for the American consumer. Everything that has happened since then has borne out my misgivings. Even without enactment of this bill we have seen how the agreement can be used to push the price of coffee up. The United States should not participate in any such price boosting scheme at our own expense. Programs of foreign aid should be dealt with as part of the. authorization and appropriation by Cofigiessand not slipped in in this roundabout way through boosting the price *of coffee at the expense of the American housewife. This legislation should be defeated.\n',purpose bill increase price coffee other purpose sole aim objective legislation enact mean attain objective direct_indirect roundabout ask grant certain

I have five amendments I filed: (i) An amendment providing for a team of oversight auditors. (ii) an amendment providing for prebankruptcy bonuses paid to top executives be pulled back into the bankrupt corporations estate. (iii) an amendment providing the Securities Exchange Commission with disgorgement remedies. (iv) an amendment providing that auditors who sell tax shelter products cannot opine on the financial effects of the tax shelter deal. and. (v) last. an amendment providing whistleblower protection to the accountants and others who want to disclose financial statement misconduct. I am pleased. in regard to the last amendment I just announced about whistleblowers. Senators LEAHY and HATCH accepted that proposal as part of their amendment which has been adopted. I am not going to speak about the other four. I am just going to speak about one of those. It is the first amendment I put on my list. an amendment providing for a team of oversight auditors. As I said. I congratulate my colleagues. Senators SARBANES and ENZI on their hard work in moving S. 2673 out of Committee and bringing the bill to the floor for further debate. The reform bill *is a great step in the right direction for -tackling some of the difficult accounting problems our Nation currently faces. Nevertheless. I believe the reform bill isnt quite tough enough on several issues and should be strengthened further. consequently. the amendment. In my view. the recent rash of accounting scandals did not result from incompetency or lack of rigorous training of accounting professionals. Neither has the problem lied principally with misguided auditing standards known as GAAS or illconsidered accounting rules known as GAAP. The Worldcom debacle. among others. further demonstrated that the problem does not rest entirely with a companys external auditors--whose best efforts may not detect financial misrepresentations if fraud is repeatedly covered up by corporate insiders or contrived to defeat established internal controls. Instead. each of the most recent corporate accounting scandals appear to have arisen from egregiously bad behavior of corporate insiders and internal accountantswithvarying degrees of complicity by those companies external auditors. Thus. as a matter of principle. I agree with the ""bad apples"" theory being offered by many. However. I believe addressing those bad apples requires additional oversightand not just of a companys external accountants but of the internal accounting function itself. To that end. I further respond to the Presidents call for increased oversight and would like to offer an amendment that would strengthen the provisions SarbanesEnzi bill by expanding- the powers of the oversight board to require the performance of ""spot audits."" The underlying bill which focuses on monitoring external auditors woudbe. amended to provide additional board oversight of internal corporate accounting. Specfically. my amendment would charge the. Board with responisibility for conducting oversight audits or ""spot audits"" of public companies. The board would serve in a role analogous to the Internal Revenue Service or the Federal Bank Examiner. The IRS. for example. achieves voluntary public compliance through review of a very limited number of federal tax returns each year. The IRS does not verify each and every tax return. Similarly. the Federal Bank Examiner sporadically and randomly audits various banks throughout the country. Such. ""spot auditing. has been an extremely effective oversight tool for the banking industry and one which has resulted in higher levels of regulatory compliance. In similar fashion. I believe that accountants and corporate America will prepare more carefully their financial statements if exposed to the risk of compliance review by the boards oversight auditors. . Even in selfregulated form. the accounting industry has long recognized the need for a second level of review. To that end. 24 years ago the ACIPA established the peer review process by which one accounting firm would review audit work of another accounting firm. For example. Deloitte & Touche was for many years the assigned peer reviewer of Arthur Andersen. Industrywide selfchecking on top of industry selfregulation seems illconceived and has been widely critized for its effectiveness by lawmakers and the SEC. Over the past 25 years. a Big Five accounting firm has never issued a qualified report against another Big Five accounting firm at the end of any peer review despite the subsequent discovery of numerous irregularities including numerous conflicts of interest from stock ownership in audit clients. This recognized need for. a second level of review is longstanding although the mechanism originally established by the accounting industry seems to have proven largely inadequate. Some may ask why the Board should be granted powers which may be exercised currently by the SEC. The answer is simply resources. Providing an effective mechanism for spot checking the books of various issuers requires a dedicated audit staff to carry out those purposes. Having resources dedicated to a regulatory review process would allow the oversight board to take a proactive approach in reviewing for accounting irregularities and take the SEC out of a purely reactive posture with respect to corporate -accounting fraud. The SEC has done a great job of investigating corporate scandals once detected. Unfortunately. by the time many of the recent scandals were discovered. things had progressed too far. We were unable to salvage the companies and the life savings of thousands of employees and shareholders. I believe the oversight auditor would provide a deterrent to committing fraud when coupled with tougher criminal sanctions. I further believe that earlier detection could prevent the absolute destruction of companies in which fraud remains uncovered for too long a period of time. I note that the concept of an oversight auditor within the public oversight board was rejected in the accounting reform proposal offered by the SEC and Harvey Pitt on June 20. The draft emphasized that the SECs vision of a newly dreated public oversight board reassured corporate America that the newlycreated oversight board would require the cooperation of audited corporations ""only to the extent necessary to further . . . reviews or proceedings regarding the [audit corporations] accountant."" The draft further promised that the new oversight board would not conduct ""roving investigations"" of audited corporations nor would the board sanction those corporations. It occurs to me that by shifting exclusive focus and responsibility to accounting firms. we ignore the underlying behavior of corporate. wrongdoers who have principal responsibility for fair and accurate financial reporting to corporate shareholders. Under my proposal. the newly created oversight board would be charged with reviewing the financial statements of issuers and focusing its resources on highestrisk audit areas and questionable accounting practices of which it is aware from the SEC Division of Enforcement or other sources such as whistleblowers under provisions I heartily supported. Upon discovery. the board would refer findings of possible accounting or auditing irregularity to the Division of Enforcement with respect to issuers or other appropriate federal and state enforcement officials such as the Presidents newlycreated Fraud Task Force within the Department of Justice. This referral mechanism would ensure that those agencies continue to have primary authority and responsibility for conducting comprehensive corporate investigations of possible wrongdoing. The oversight board. of course. would have authority to conduct investigations of possible wrongdoing with respect to the involvement of accounting firms within its jurisdiction. That is a basic summary of what this amendment would accomplish. I urge my colleagues to support establishment of an oversight auditor as a means of improving the compliance of corporate issuers and their external accounting firms and detecting irregularities at a much earlier point in the system when a shareholder value remains salvageable. It seems to me that my amendment comes down to just a simple case of common sense. As I think proven so many times before. auditors need to be audited in the same way the IRS does it for tax returns and in the same way bank examiners do it in the case of bank audits. If auditors know their work will itself be audited. they will think twice about looking the other way on shady deals. as we have seen. My amendment would put some very specific teeth in the SarbanesEnzi bill. At this point. I was hoping the Senator from Texas was going to be here because I have done so much for him on a lot of Finance Committee bills. Im referring to tax bills. including the recent CARE bill and the recent energy bill. I have helped him with so many amendments that he wanted. I was sure he would be willing to help me get unanimous consent to get my amendment up. particularly in light of the factthat last week I was assured when it wasnt on the list that it would be on the list. Then I came back and found that it meant being last on the list. Now we are getting down to the end. I would like to have what I consider kind of a commitment. although it probably is not an ironclad commitment. that I be on the list. and. obviously. I would be able to get a vote on my amendment. At this point. I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be laid aside for the purpose of taking up my amendment just described. which is amendment No. 4232.\n'",amendment file i amendment provide team

Kaiser is hot on the trail of another $93.000.000 Governmentowned steel plant. He wants to lease it on his own terms and devote it to his private interests. A month ago he declined to bid on the plant. Other experienced steel makers made official offers. Now Kaiser is endeavoring to have these bona fide proposals on the plant. located in South Chicago. Ill.. thrown out. and a lease plan which will fit his individual purposes substituted. What he really desires and has suggested to the War Assets Corporation is a trick lease which will enable him to produce sheet steel in the plant. and thus help him develop his embryonic automobile and housing projects. The plant Es it now stands is not equipped to produce the sheet steel which Kaiser desires. Experienced steel men say that it would require $25.000.000 new expenditures and 2 or 3 years work to put the plant in shape to make sheet steel for Kaisers enterprises. The $25.000.000 in new money. under the standard Kaiser plan. would. of course. come out of the taxpayers. In the past when he has proposed executing leases with the Government for plants requiring rehabilitations it always has been the public and not Kaiser who has put up the new cash. After that. he has been willing to pay the Government something if he earned money. Otherwise. not. The South Chicago plant which Kaiser now wants originally was offered for sale by War Assets Corporation on April 1. 1946. Kaiser then could not decide whether he desired to bid on it or not. so he succeeded in getting the sale postponed until May 1. On April 24 he wrote a letter to the War Assets Corporation stating that the plant was unsuitable for his purposes and. therefore. he would not bid. Three proposals were received and officially recorded by the War Assets Corporation. Meantime. due chiefly to strikes. Kaiser. in common with other automobile manufacturers. found it difficult to get steel. so he decided that perhaps it would be smart for him to try to induce the War Assets Corporation to throw out the legitimate purchase bids received on May 1. and order new bids on a sheet steel production basis. In an attempt to secretly wreck other bidders. Kaiser has now suggested to the War Assets Corporation that the May 1 proposals be thrown out and new ones. looking to operating the plant as a sheet steel mill exclusively. be requested. Under such a plan. Kaiser says he thinks he probably can negotiate a proposal satisfactory to the Government. but he wants to do it on a restricted lease basis. Thus Kaiser proposes just another of his typical shoestring operations. He doubtless would put up little or none of his own money for a lease. and instead he probably would take over the present $93.000.000 taxpayer investment and have another $25.000.000 or so of public money spent for improvements to help meet the needs of his private businesses. Then. possibly. sometime. if he made a profit on his automobiles and houses. he would pay the Government something. How Kaiser utilizes Government plants and money to forward his private promotions is shown by the use he is making of steel produced by the Governmentbuilt Fontana steel mill. This plant was built with public money and turned over to Kaiser for operation on the theory that thus the steel needs of the west coast would be best served. Through a quarterpage advertisement recently in the Washington Post. paid for by Kaiser. we are informed that he is shipping steel east from the Fontana plant for use in manufacturing his new automobile at Willow Run. Mich. This ""help Kaiser"" program certainly is not in line with either congressional or public desires. Bothgroups feel. and rightly. that all surplus war properties should be leased or sold to legitimate bidders without favoritism. When proposals have been submitted in good faith. as they have been in this case. they should be opened and the plant awarded to the highest bidder. If War Assets Corporation rejects the bids for the South Chicago plant merely to provide Kaiser with .an opportunity to snatch some more public property and promote his speculative enterprises. I and several other Members of the Senate propose to know the reason why. It is time to stop the Kaiser grabs of land. equipment. buildings. and money. If the agencies entrusted with this surplus property will not protect taxpayer interests. then Congress will have to do it. I. for one. am ready to do my part.\n'",hot trail governmentowned steel plant want lease own term devote private interest month decline bid plant other experienced steel maker make official offer endeavor bona_fide proposal plant locate throw lease plan fit individual purpose substitute desire suggest trick lease enable produce sheet steel plant help develop embryonic automobile housing project plant stand equip produce sheet steel desire experience steel man say require new expenditure year work put plant shape make sheet steel enterprise new money standard plan course come taxpayer past propose execute lease plant require rehabilitation public put new cash willing pay earn money plant want offer sale decide desire bid succeed get sale postpone write letter state plant unsuitable purpose bid proposal receive record due strike common other automobile manufacturer find difficult get steel decide smart try induce throw legitimate purchase bid receive order new bid sheet steel production basis attempt wreck other bidder suggest proposal throw new one look operate plant sheet steel_mill request plan say think negotiate proposal satisfactory want restricted lease basis propose typical shoestring operation put little none own money lease take present taxpayer investment public money spend improvement help meet need private business make profit automobile house pay government utilize government plant money forward private promotion show use make steel produce steel_mill plant build public money turn operation theory steel need serve quarterpage_advertisement pay inform ship steel plant use manufacture new automobile help program line congressional public desire bothgroup feel surplus war property lease sell legitimate bidder favoritism proposal submit good faith case open plant award high bidder reject bid plant provide opportunity snatch public property promote speculative enterprise several other member propose know reason time stop grab land equipment building money agency entrust surplus property protect taxpayer interest ready part.\n,79.0,bound,1,0

I want to express my strong support for the amendment offered by my colleague from California (Mr. LEV1NEj. This amendment would extend current export restrictions on Alaskan crude oil to crude produced in California. The Commerce Departmentfs proposal to permit export of California crude oil does not make sense from an economic. national security or environmental point of view. From an economic stand point. our Nation already imports over 40 percent of its crude ol. any oil we export will have to be replaced by more imports. This may ultimately hurt domestic refiners. their workers and the American consumer. In addition. export of domestic crude does nothing to enhance our energy selfsufficiency and national security. Those who advocate more domestic oil production. often by drilling off our coasts. say that our Nation needs to reduce its dependence on foreign oil. Yet. the export of domestic crude Increases our need for foreign oilthereby reducing our energy security. If we need more domestic oil. do not export our existing crude. Finally. a cycle of exporting California crude oil and replacing it with foreign oil will increase tanker traffic and the possibility of oilspills along the Pacific coastline. It could also renew pressure to exploit reserves along the Outer Continental Shelf. The environmental risk is certainly not worth the shortterm economic gain hoped for from domestic exports. In sum. the export of California crude oil is not good energy policy. I urge the adoption of the Levine amendment.\n',want express strong support amendment offer colleague amendment extend current export restriction alaskan_crude oil crude produce proposal permit export crude_oil make sense economic national security environmental point view economic stand point nation import percent crude_oil export replace more import hurt domestic refiner worker american consumer addition export domestic crude enhance energy_selfsufficiency national security advocate more domestic oil production drill coast say need reduce dependence_foreign oil export domestic crude increase need foreign oilthereby reduce energy security need more domestic oil export exist crude cycle export crude_oil replace foreign oil increase tanker traffic possibility oilspill coastline renew pressure exploit reserve environmental risk worth shortterm economic gain hope domestic export sum export crude_oil good energy policy urge_adoption amendment.\n,101.0,daily,1,0

I voted for H.R. 4328. the omnibus appropriations bill. I believe that on balance. this legislation will benefit California. This bill is 4.000 pages. 38 pounds. and stands a foot tall. It appropriates $500 billion. funds a third of the federal government for fiscal year 1999. and includes many pieces of authorizing legislation. My staff reviewed the entire bill yesterday. It includes properly written legislative bill language as well as many hand written changes and amendments. Congressional negotiators. the administration. and many staff members have worked for weeks to finalize this legislation today. but that work was often done behind closed doors without the full review of the Senate. I do not believethat this is the way the Congress should do its work. Our choice today was to shut down the government or pass this bill. I want. however. to note that the omnibus bill provides many benefits for Californians. This bill funds several education initiatives. It includes $1.2 billion to hire teachers and reduce elementary class sizes. an effort already underway in California. This will mean 3.500. new teachers in California. This bill also includes increased funding for Head Start. for Education Reform. for bilingual education. for charter schools. for educational technology and for student financial assistance. California school enrollment is growing at 3 times the national rate. We need to build 7 new classrooms a day at 25 students per class just to keep up with the growth in student population. We have students in closets. in cafeterias. In portables. We have some of the largest class sizes in the nation. We have 22.000 teachers on emergency credentials. California ranks last in the nation in the percentage of young adults with a high school diploma. Our students rank 37th in the country in SAT scores. The California public school system has gone from one of the best. to one of the worse. Mr. President. quite simply. we welcome this assistance for the California education system. I am disappointed that the bill includes a ""hold harmless"" provision for ESEA Title I. Title I is the largest federal elementary and secondary education program. providing funds to virtually every school district in the country to educate disadvantaged children. Title I has often been called the ""anchor"" of all elementary and secondary education programs since its enactment in 1965. The bill includes $7.8 billion for Title I grants to school districts. California received $830 million last year. Unfortunately. the bill includes a 100 percent ""hold harmless"" provision under which no school district would receive an allocation that is less than its allocation of the previous year. But the effect of the hold harmless provision for California. that has had an increase in the number of poor children. is not to receive all of the increase in funding to which we are entitled. entitled by law. Thankfully. the bill does include an ""extra"" $301 million that would provide some funds for highgrowth states like mine. California could receive as much as $60 million out of the $301 million. I believe the dollars should go equally to all children in the country based on need. I call on my colleagues to join me in working to join in an effort to make sure the dollars follow the children. This Senator pledges to devote every ounce of energy I can muster to help our schools deliver on the promise of opportunity and achievement that Americas public schools have always represented and I call on my colleagues to join me today in this campaign.\n'",today vote omnibus appropriation bill believe balance legislation benefit bill page pound stand foot_tall appropriate fund third federal government fiscal year include many piece authorize legislation staff review entire bill yesterday include write legislative bill language many hand write change amendment congressional negotiator administration many staff member work week finalize legislation today work do closed_door full review believethat way work choice today shut government pass bill want note omnibus bill provide many benefit bill fund several education initiative include hire teacher reduce elementary class size effort underway mean new teacher bill include increase funding bilingual_education charter school educational technology student financial assistance school enrollment grow time national rate need build new classroom day student class keep growth student population student closet portable large class size nation teacher emergency credential rank nation percentage young adult high school_diploma student rank 37th country score public school system go good bad welcome assistance education system disappoint bill include hold_harmless provision esea large federal elementary_secondary education program provide fund school district country educate disadvantaged child title call anchor elementary_secondary education program enactment bill include grant school district receive last year bill include percent hold_harmless provision school district receive allocation less allocation previous year effect hold_harmless provision increase number poor child receive increase funding entitle entitle law bill include extra provide fund highgrowth state receive much believe dollar go child country base need call colleague join work join effort make sure dollar follow child pledge devote ounce energy muster help school deliver promise opportunity achievement public school represent call colleague join today campaign.\n,105.0,daily,0,1

I am submitting two amendments affecting the National Park Service appropriation. The first would reduce funding for the operation of the national park system by $10.4 million. $400.000 of which is from general administration and the balance from park maintenance. The general administration reduction is in line with the House allowance and is part of a servicewide reduction in travel. The park maintenance reduction merely slows the rate of increase in this activity. The fiscal 1981 funding level was $188.7 million. Even with this $10 million reduction. the fiscal year 1982 level would be $230.9 million. This proposal will not adversely affect the health and safety components of the planned program. but rather will be taken from rehabilitation projects and increases requested for cyclic maintenance. The second amendment would reduce the committee allowance for construction by $20.000.000. leaving an increase over the fiscal year 1981 level of $44.178.000. The revised funding level would permit projects directly related to health and safety to continue. The reduction is targeted at major rehabilitation and repair projects.

As a public servant he carries a reputation for the highest integrity.

In my ownState of Massachusetts. Woburn and New Bedford Harbor .are just two of the extremely dangerous hazardous waste sites targeted by EPA for cleanupbut neglected by the agency. The 14 such sites nationally await the prompt attention of Mr. Ruckelshaus. and I am confident that he will move expeditiously to meet the challenge. There are few. if any. agencies created over the past two decades that have a more important mission than the Environmental Protection Agency. It is encouraging to see a man of Mr. Ruckelshaus caliber selected to head his old agency. He is uniquely qualified to rescue EPA from its present scandals and restore its preeminent role in safeguarding the environment and protecting the public health. Let us hope that the days are over when EPA was just another weapon in James Watts assault against the environment. I look forward to working with Mr. Ruckelshaus to insure that EPA lives up to its mandate. We are fortunate that he is willing to return to public service when the country needs him. He has the confidence of the Congress. and I am pleased to support his confirmation by the Senate.\n',like take opportunity express support record first wellknown implementation begin leadership public_servant carry reputation high integrity congressional mandate support protection environment many important responsibility urgent responsibility take affirmative_action carry provision law ownstate woburn .are dangerous hazardous_waste site target neglect agency such site await prompt attention confident move meet challenge few agency create past decade important mission encouraging see man caliber select head old agency qualified rescue present scandal restore preeminent role safeguard environment protect public health let hope day weapon assault environment look work insure live mandate fortunate willing return public service country need confidence pleased support confirmation senate.\n,98.0,daily,0,1

The chairman of the Committee on Military Affairs raised it. The Committee on Military Affairs is supposed to be conversant with its subject. Ever since I have been here. which. to be sure. is only three sessions. I have found the Committee on Military Affairs composed of men who do know their subjects. The members of the Committee on Appropriations have interests so diversified. so numerous. that they can scarcely be expected to know as much about a technical subject as members of a committee reporting all the legislation on that subject. The present bill carries less than onethird of the amount of the estimates. The fortification bill for 1898 carried $9.517.141. the fortification bill for 1897 carried $7.377.888. The Chief of Ordnance and the Chief of Engineers recommended for this year a total appropriation of $13.378.571. and this committee has cut it down arbitrarily. without assigning any reason. to a little over $4.000.000. less than onethird. The report of the United States Senate committee. made February 25.1896. places the estimates of the Chief of Engineers and Chief of Ordnance. the total amount for the coast defenses from start to finish. at $105.296.000. I find in the hearings had before the Committee on Appropriations that to complete the work of fortifications will require about $80.000.000. The Chief of Ordnance states that at the rate of the appropriations of last year. and at the rate of the estimates for this year. the country can be put in condition of defense in from six to seven years. He further states that if his appropriations are cut down to the present figures it will require nearly twenty years to put us in a proper condition of defense. In referring to this he makes this significant statement: It is not a pleasant thing to contemplate. when I know what would be the result if a foreign fleet should come to certain of our ports. The reason assigned by the Committee on Appropriations for cutting down the appropriation from $13000.000 to $4.000.000 is that the revenues are not sufficient. and yet they have not economized in other appropriation bills. It seems to be their position that the national defense is a matter of such small moment that we can afford to skimp on it and keep other appropriations up. Economy is one thing. parsimony is another. The Committee on Appropriations seems to have taken little interest in this matter. It has cut down all along the line without condescending to give the reasons for any of the cuts.\n',raise question chairman raise suppose conversant subject sure session find compose man know subject member interest diversified numerous expect know much technical subject member committee report legislation subject present bill carry less amount estimate fortification bill carry fortification bill carry recommend year total appropriation committee cut assign reason little less report committee make place estimate total amount coast defense start finish find hearing complete work fortification require state rate appropriation last year rate estimate year country put condition defense year state appropriation cut present figure require year put proper condition defense refer make significant statement pleasant thing contemplate know result foreign fleet come certain port reason assign cut appropriation revenue sufficient economize other appropriation bill seem position national defense matter such small moment afford skimp keep other appropriation economy thing parsimony seem take little interest matter cut line condescend give reason cuts.\n,55.0,bound,0,1

I rise in opposition to the gentlemans amendment. This was. as the gentleman accurately said. one of the many amendments which the subcommittee had before it and considered carefully during the writeup and markup of the bill. and which the full committee also considered. But we made the judgment and made the agreement that this addition. as proposed by the gentleman. would make the bill too broad in its coverage and potential. Even though none of us could agree that identifying wrongly or mistakenly some individual was correct conduct. certainly it renders that individual just as impotent to act in the capacity of intelligence as correctly identifying them. and we still said or felt as a committee that this was going beyond the regular bounds of this kind of a bill. It. in effect. makes it a crime to basically call somebody a bad name. Now. the gentlemans amendment which earlier was approved does seem to set up what the gentleman from Kentucky feels is a negligence standard. And if we further broadened tile coverage of that section. then I do believe we have gone beyond the bounds of a correct bill. I would simply say that this is not sponsored by or supported by the intelligence agencies. nor is it urged upon us by the Department of Justice. As a matter of fact. both of them have misgivings about this kind of approach. We had testimony before us by the legal academic community and they. in answer to the gentleman from Illi.nois who propounded a question. suggested that the language as proposed by the gentleman would constitute a problem. The bill which is before us is to protect national security interests and the lives of people who are purstiing .national security interests. I certainly have nothing but the height of disregard for those who would name names which are eigther accurately named or inaccurately named. because the end product Is about the same. But I worry about the addition of the gentlemans amendment for fear of making this bill too broad in its coverage and more or less a bill which would be transgressing the kind of legal standards which have been built up in the past for this kind of conduct. Therefore. I would urge the House to reject the gentlemans amendment and to support the committee position.\n',rise opposition gentleman amendment gentleman say many amendment subcommittee consider writeup_markup bill full committee consider make judgment make agreement addition propose gentleman make bill broad coverage potential none agree identify individual correct conduct render individual impotent act capacity intelligence identify say feel committee go regular bound kind bill effect make crime call bad name amendment approve seem set gentleman feel negligence standard broaden tile coverage section believe go bound correct bill say sponsor support intelligence agency urge matter fact misgiving kind approach testimony legal academic community answer gentleman propound question suggest language propose gentleman constitute problem bill protect national security interest life people purstie .national security interest height disregard name name eigther name name end product same worry addition amendment fear make bill broad coverage more bill transgress kind legal standard build past kind conduct urge reject amendment support committee position.\n,97.0,daily,0,1

We took nine amendments to conference and reached a settlement on all of them. although two are reported in technical disagreement. As indicated earlier. in amendment No. 42. the Senate had proposed to liberalize present restrictive law on reimbursable travel expenses for Senators between Washington and their home States. In conference. they receded. Present law on the matter will therefore remain applicable. Amendment 44 as agreed to makes the usual provision. for 1 more year. for expenses of the Joint Committee on Reduction of Nonessential Federal Expenditures. In amendments Nos. 45 through 48. the Senate adjusted the salaries of the three top positions in the Architects organization and we have concurred. I might add that in the opinion of some. the rates specified in the amendments are not as high as they should be. but we could not. under the rules. agree to more than the highest rates submitted to the conference. In this connection. I would point out that last year the House. in the second supplemental bill. approved rates of $22.000. $20.200. and $18.500. respectively. for the three positions but these were dropped in conference on insistence of the Senate that they be deferred for consideration in the regular 1962 bill. as has now been done. Perhaps the matter can be again considered at some future date. I have mentioned before that at the insistence of the Senate. we agreed to the $30.000 in amendment 50 to repaint the ceiling of the legislative garage. It has not been painted since 1932. We have consistently denied the item. feeling it not essential. but the Senate insists it ought to be done. Amendment No. 51. to which we have agreed. provides $25.000 to bring up to date the Annotated Constitution. The House had disallowed the budget request of $34.200. it appearing that there was no urgency to do the work this year. The Library restudied the matter and found that by some slight administrative adjustments they could get by with $25.000. The publication is useful. There have been five previous editions. The Government Printing Office sells a substantial quantity. We have gone along with the foreign currency proposition in amendment No. 52. It involves $400.000. but all but $36.500 of that is to buy from the Treasury foreign currencies now owned by the Treasury. The budget before us when the bill was in the House was for $721.000. including $67.200 of hard dollar expenditures and $653.800 to buy foreign currencies from the Treasury. We turned it down. primarily because we felt some reasonable arrangement should be worked out whereby the libraries which are to be the recipients of the foreign materials to be acquired in the United Arab Republic. India. and Pakistan would bear more of the costs involved. The Senate explored that matter and also asked the Library to scale the entire proposition down to the bare feasible minimum. We have accepted the Senate position. but as pointed out in the statement of the managers. we feel that increased contributions should be made by the recipient libraries. In our report we said: The conferees expect that at least the contribution of $5.000 offered by the recipient libraries through the Association of Research Libraries will be made available to the Library of Congress to help defray the expenses of this pilot project during fiscal year 1962 and also expect the Librarian to take immediate steps to obtain a more substantial contribution in this and future years.

Therefore. it goes without saying that whatever hurts cotton. hurts the economy of the entire State. Georgia cotton farmers presently are in more dire financial straits than at any time since the depression of the thirties. Caught in the squeeze between everconstricting acreage allotments and everincreasing costs of production. many are being forced out of business altogether. Most of those who are continuing to grow cotton are doing so at a loss. and a large number are finding it necessary to mortgage their farms in order to maintain their operations. A major factor in this deterioration of Georgias cotton economy is the transfer to other States under the Benson farm program of the acreage allotments of those farmers who cease planting. This constitutes a continual drain of Georgias historicallyallotted cotton acreage and. if allowed to continue. will have the eventual result of drying up the rural areas of my State. Recognizing the peril thus posed for Georgias economy. the House of Representatives of the General Assembly of Georgia has adopted a resolution petitioning Congress to reverse this disastrous policy of transferring allotted acreage.

I would like to comment on one section of the Defense authorization which I think represents a disturbing trend toward increasing the paperwork burden on our Nations defense industry in a wellintentioned but misguided attempt to control defense coas. Section 329 of the bill mandates stanJards for defense contractor accounting systems. Many will argue that this is a minor and inoffensive provision. and Indeed it probably pales in comparison with the intrusive paperwork and reporting requirements that we have already imposed on our defense industry. And yet it is one more step toward the incorporation of private companiesowned and operated by private Americansinto the Federal bureaucracy. U.S. military equipment and technology is second to that of no other country in the world today for one reason: We rely on private enterprise to supply our arsenal of democracy. Private enterprises. competing against each other. using the skills and disciplines developed In the open marketplace. are able to produce the finest equipment in the world. We must recognize this basic source of our strength. Sadly. many seem to feel that if a business is involved in a transaction with the Government. it virtually becomes part of the Federal Government. They believe that we can require reports. dictate internal policies. and mandate inspection of these private businesses in the same way that we would for a Federal agency. The result may actually be increased costs and reduced efficiency as these companies are forced to assume enormous administrative burdens and are prevented from adopting policies appropriate to their unique circumstances. Our defense industry is already shackled with Government paperwork. We must unshackle it. I would submit that there is another. vastly superior. approach to restraining the cost of national defense. We should whenever possible distribute contracts through a competitive bidding process and require. to the extent possible. that contractors not exceed their bids. Such an approach would draw on the strengths of our system rather than undermine those strengths. I realize that section 329 was included in this bill with the best of intentions. I feel. however. that it is most unwise. and I strongly urge that it be amended or removed before this bill becomes law.\n',like comment section authorization think represent disturbing_trend increase paperwork_burden defense industry wellintentioned_misguided attempt control defense coas section bill mandate defense contractor accounting system many argue minor inoffensive provision pale_comparison intrusive paperwork reporting_requirement impose defense industry more step incorporation private companiesowne operate private bureaucracy military equipment technology second other country world today reason rely private_enterprise supply arsenal democracy private_enterprise compete other use skill discipline develop open marketplace able produce fine equipment world recognize basic source strength many seem feel business involve transaction become part believe require report dictate internal policy mandate inspection private business same way agency result increase cost reduce efficiency company force assume enormous administrative burden prevent adopt policy appropriate unique circumstance defense industry shackle paperwork unshackle submit superior approach restrain cost national defense possible distribute contract competitive_bidding process require extent possible contractor exceed bid approach draw strength system undermine strength realize section include bill good intention feel unwise urge amend remove bill become law.\n,100.0,daily,1,0

I certainly lay no claim to being an expert in the field of legislation affecting civilservice employees. I have followed several policies very consistently in voting on such legislation. On questions involving the extent of annual and sick leave that might be advanced to any employee of the Government I have always voted for the smallest amount and the shortest time. I did. however. have occasion to ascertain circumstances which affect the leave of employees accumulated during the war years. We all know that during the war years 1941 to 1945. inclusive. employees. particularly in the Defense Department. were not allowed to take their leave. Even if they had been allowed to take it. they could not have obtained transportation. so that they would have had to take it here in Washington. Many of them accumulated a great deal of leave. In some instances. I believe. it ran over 100 days. It may have been as much as 120 days. I am not positive as to that. At the end of the war Congress passed an act which provided that those employees should be permitted to have 90 days of such leave. and that it would be available to them when they desired to take it. I regarded that. Mr. President. as a contract on the part of the Government. Last year an act was passed by the Congress which authorized the heads of various agencies to make a regulation which would limit the leave to 30 days and compel the employees to take it. Information has come to me. Mr. President. that in some instances this regulation will have the effect of denying leave to some Federal employees. In my opinion. if that condition does exist. it is almost dishonest for the Government to deprive employees of leave which they were forced to accumulate during the war years. The effect of the adoption of this amendment will be only to protect the leave which was allowed employees of the Government during the war. and which was ratified by an act of Congress enacted shortly after the end of the war.\n',lay claim expert field legislation affect civilservice employee follow several policy vote such legislation question involve extent annual sick leave advanced employee vote small amount short time occasion ascertain circumstance affect leave employee accumulate war year know war year inclusive employee allow take leave allow take obtain transportation take many accumulate great deal leave instance believe run day much day positive end war pass act provide employee permit day such leave available desire take regard contract part last year act pass authorize head various agency make regulation limit leave day compel employee take information come instance regulation effect deny leave federal employee opinion condition exist dishonest deprive employee leave force accumulate war year effect adoption amendment protect leave allow employee war ratify act enact end war.\n,83.0,bound,0,1

In order to show that window glass is not entitled to the increased rate which the President put into effect by his proclamation. I wish to show that. as compared with the prewar and postwar prices of commodities in the United States generally. window glass has not suffered by comparison. We find the following facts. based upon the prices in 1928. as to the average increase in the cost of commodities figured on the standard adopted by the nations of the earth as a basis under what they call the index of commodity prices. which is recognized by all economists in all nations. taking the year 1.913 as the basis. the price in that year representing 100 per cent. Taking 1913 as the basic year. we find that. l)y comparison. the average increase in costs of all commodities in the United States was 40 per cent. In other words. the average of prices in the United States in the year 1928 as compared with 1913 was as 140 compared with 100. We find in the matter of farm products that the comparison in 1928 was as 148 to 100. With reference to foods. it was as 157 to 100. With reference to hides and leather. it was as 178 to 100. With reference to textile products. it was as 168 to 100. With reference to fuel and lighting it was as 135 to 100. a little below the postwar normal. As to building materials. which item includes. of course. brick. cement. glass. and lumber. all the materials that go into the building industry of the United States. compared with a normal increase of from 100 to 140 for all commodities. we find that building material occupies the position of 170 per cent. while house furnishings occupy the position of 172 per cent. Window glass. therefore. as a part of the material going into the construction of buildings in the United States. is now about 30 per cent higher than the normal average prices for all products in the United States in 1928. -An investigation into the cost of producing window glass in this country and in Belgium was made by the Tariff Commission as of the year 1926. The factory costs in this country. f. o. b. plant. under the sheetdrawing process. were $3.56 per 50 square feet. and under the cylinder process $4.21 per 50 square feet. Inasmuch as the factory price. which is. of course. f. o. b. the plant. is shown to have been $3.90 in 1920 per 50 square feet for Grade A single strength. it Is easy to see why the LibbeyOwens Co.. which uses now and has used altogether the modern process of sheetdrawing manufacture of window glass. makes such enormous profits while the American Window Glass. which used at the time the obsolete cylinder method. was here asking for an increased tariff upon window glass. It was the handblowers in 1922 who were here asking for an increase in the tariff on window glass because they were then in competition with the American Window Glass Co.. which was using the cylinder process in 1922. which was then an improvement over the handblown process. The American Window Glass Co. did not come here in 1922 and ask for any increase in the tariff on window glass. Only those who were seeking to perpetuate the outofdate methods of making window glass were here in 1922. but reversing the position and carrying it into effect as logically. the American Window Glass Co.. which was using the antiquated process. in 1926 was asking the Tariff Commission and the President to increase the rates in order that they might retain those antiquated. oldfashioned and expensive methods of making window glass as compared to the LibbeyOwens process then in vogue and in use by that company. which then made and is now making about 40 per cent of all of the window glass produced In the United States. The two companies. the American Window Glass Co. and LibbeyOwens Sheet Glass Co.. produced between 70 and 80 per cent of all the window glass made in the United States.

Passage ensures our troops get a 1.6 percent pay raise and the benefits their families rely upon. This bill also ensures that we continue to fulfill our Nations most sacred obligations to our brave men and women serving in the greatest allvolunteer force in history. The service by our men and women in uniform is priceless. especially during the last 10 years of combat operations. Besides thanking them for their service and sacrifice to this Nation in ensuring they are afforded the best benefits and care for their service. theres little we can do to repay them for standing the watch and keeping America safe. This bill authorizes a modest 1.6 percent pay increase. but it never can express how truly grateful we are as a Nation for the service and sacrifice of our allvolunteer force and their families. Additionally. some very important provisions were included to ensure our industrial base maintains a constant workload and a fully employed workforce. and $14.9 billion was authorized for U.S. Navy shipbuilding. a total of 10 ships. which include two Virginia class submarines. The bill also extends the multiyear funding authority for the second and third Fordclass aircraft carriers for 4 to 5 years of incremental funding authority. American ingenuity. creativity. and initiative are alive and well in our shipyards that build warships for the United States Navy. Shipbuilding is supported through business and industry spanning 50 States and designed and engineered by our greatest assetthe American people. The American aircraft carrier is the pinnacle of this industrial engineering ingenuity and genius where mechanical. nuclear aerospace. and electrical engineering converge with naval architecture to form a magnificent 100.000ton. 1.092footlong piece of American sovereignty that travels anywhere. anytime around the world. Additionally. the bill reinstates the requirement for annual delivery of the Navys 30year shipbuilding plan solidifying the need for the Navy to communicate their plan as it relates to the strategic objectives of the United States balanced against a very challenging budget environment.

Belgium. Germany. Italy. and Switzerland in financing the construction of the proposed highest energy accelerator in the world. a 300billionelectronvolt machine. It is common knowledge that the research programs in Europe which require the spending of the equivalent of hundreds of millions of dollars have been in serious difficulties the past few years. For France. which has been plagued with severe economic problems. to follow through with its prior decision to support the program can only point to the strong conviction all European nations have that high energy physics is indeed the new frontier of physical research. I would like to point out that at present the highest energy accelerator in the world is the Russian 76billionelectronvolt facility at Serpukhov. The 333billionelectronvolt alternating gradient synchrotron at the AECs Brookhaven National Laboratory has the highest energy in the United States. The Congress recently voted $70 million in appropriations for the National Accelerator Laboratory at Batavia. Ill.. for fiscal year 1970. Those responsible for designing and constructing the laboratory had requested $96 million and indicated that a minimum of $89 million would be necessary to keep construction on projected cost and time schedules. If it is really the intent of the Congress that the United States return to the forefront of high energy physics research. this reduction of $26 million below the original request is false economy. since this cut. if not restored in the fiscal year 1971 appropriations. will cause about a years delay and an estimated increase of $30 million for the project. However. more than money is at stake in constructing the National Accelerator Laboratory on schedule. Dr. Robert Rathbun Wilson. the Director of the Laboratory. has listed rather succinctly nine reasons for carrying out the project as planned: Timeliness: It will be the right Instrument. for the right problems at the right time. but only if it is built soon enough. Welfare of the Country: Scientific preeminence Is a vital factor in the cultural and technological health of our country. The 200 BeV machine. if finished soon enough. will help to maintain that preeminence. Scientific Need: There are definite important scientific problems that we know can be answered by the use of the 200 BeV machine. Many of these can be done only with a 200 BeV machine. Other questions are susceptible to partial and expensive answers by the use of Inadequatu instruments. International Standing: Soviet physicists now have an operating 76 BeY machine. while the United States present top is only 33 BeV. Our 200 BeV accelerator should come Into operation before the European 300 BeV machine and with enough time to insure and maintain a leading positionif built on schedule. Scientific exploration: In scientific discovery there is no second prizeJust a bag to be left holding. Quality of the accelerator: Our present schedule wil provide the United States with the most advanced research facility in the world. Quality of the participants: Outstanding scientists will only associate themselves with a vigorous project. Too little. too late will draw mediocre people who will perform mediocre experiments and at a very much higher cost. Direct cost: A delay in the schedule will Incur a large additional cost. Eventual cost: In the light of the 300 Bev European machine. delay of even one year suggests that the scope of the American effort should be reviewed. This would almost certainly lead to a reorientation of the project to a larger and hence more expensive machine. I would like to add one more thought. The State of Illinois has acted aggressively to keep its part of the bargain. The State acquired and turned over to the Federal Government a 6.800acre site which cost some $26 million. Both State and local governments have worked hard to provide those adequate services so necessary to the success of the project. The State and local governments have sacrificed much to carry out their commitments in keeping with the proposed schedule. It would certainly seem that the Federal Government should try to do the same.\n',announce honor commitment join finance construction propose high energy accelerator world machine common knowledge research program require spending equivalent hundred_million dollar serious difficulty past few year plague severe economic problem follow prior decision support program point strong conviction european nation high energy physics new frontier physical research like point present high energy accelerator world russian facility alternate_gradient synchrotron high energy vote appropriation fiscal year responsible design construct laboratory request indicate minimum necessary keep construction project cost time schedule intent return forefront high energy physics research reduction original request false economy cut restore fiscal year appropriation cause year delay estimate increase project more money stake construct schedule list reason carry project plan timeliness right right problem right time build welfare scientific preeminence vital factor cultural technological health country bev_machine finish help maintain preeminence scientific need definite important scientific problem know answer use bev_machine many do bev_machine other question susceptible partial expensive answer use instrument soviet physicist operate bey machine present top bev. bev_accelerator come operation european bev_machine enough time insure maintain lead positionif build schedule scientific exploration scientific_discovery second bag leave hold quality accelerator present schedule wil provide advanced research facility world quality participant outstanding scientist associate vigorous project little draw mediocre people perform mediocre experiment high cost direct cost delay schedule incur large additional cost eventual cost light bev european machine delay year suggest scope american effort review lead reorientation project large expensive machine like add more thought act keep part bargain acquire turn 6.800acre site cost local government work provide adequate service necessary success project local government sacrifice carry commitment keep propose schedule seem try same.\n,91.0,bound,0,1

I thank the gentleman from Illinois for yielding time to me. Mr. Chairman. I rise in support of this bill and want to congratulate Chairman OnEY and ranking member MICKEY EDWARDS for achieving this compromise bill that is supported by both sides of the aisle and by the administration. It is not a perfect compromise. but it is the best we could achieve under tight budget constraints. As a new member of the Appropriations Committee and of this subcommittee. I now have a greater appreciation of the difficulty in moving a foreign aid bill through Congress. In this bill. we balance funding among security and humanitarian assistance. economic and development assistance. and on top of all this. the need to provide export financing assistance to level the playing field in the international market. We must address our longterm security interests as well as continuing this Nations policy of the good neighbor and the helping hand to people in desperate need. While our foreign aid programs only account for approximately I percent of U.S. expenditures. it serves the direct interest of the United States in many important ways. It enhances our national security. Without U.S. support. I believe a number of democratic regimes in strategic areas throughout the world would have been overthrown by radical insurgencies. Our foreign aid budget also allows the United States to join with other countries in responding to needs of developing countries throughout the world and to respond to world catastrophes. such as the earthquake in Armenia and the famine in Ethiopia. The bill provides important funding for Israel and Egypt. other allies and base rights countries. And. in many other strategically important areas of the world. we maintain our presende through economic. milithry and development assistance. We have expressed our support for the new multilateral initiative to strengthen democracy in the Philippines and we have maintained the 7- to 10ratio for aid to Greece and Turkey. We also provide development assistance for needy Third World countries. Through the Agency for International Development. these countries will receive assistance in areas such as agriculture. child survival. education. environment and technology. and private - sector initiatives.

In the early days the boats that came in and out of the Columbia River and navigated the lower Willamette and Columbia were deepsea craft. not of over 15 feet draft. the tonnage was small. I think when I first moved to Portland nobody suspected that the city would ever have a population to exceed 10.000. It had 3.500 then. Anybody who would have come in and proposed a 40foot channel to the sea or a 30foot channel to the sea from the city of Portland would have been considered an insane person. If a man in those days made the assertion that some day we would have electric lights or electric power for street cars. it was considered idle talk. I heard statements made In those days that some day we would have electric lights and some day we would also have electric power for street cars. and the man who made such statements was considered to be an idle dreamer. little short of insane. So it could not have been provided for at that time. The same conditions existed at Seattle. I remember the day when Seattle was nothing but the Yessler wharf aid a few inhabitants on the hill. I was there at the time. and if anybody had said that some day Seattle would be a city of two or three hundred thousand or three hundred and fifty thousand people and a port of any importance whatever they would have looked at him as a dreamer. This work has been carried on. I think. consistently. but I have no doubt somewhat extravagantly.

I rise today in strong support for H.R. 5501. the Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS. Tuberculosis. and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008. This important piece of legislation outlines the United States efforts to combat the devastating effects of AIDS. Malaria. and Tuberculosis on our global community. I am extremely encouraged that this bill declares Tuberculosis control a major objective of U.S. foreign assistance programsparticulary. that this bill will encourage the development of a TB vaccine. TB is the leading killer of people with HIV/ AIDS. and the explosion of drugresistant TB in subSaharan Africa threatens to halt and roll back our progress in combating both diseases. In fact. the World Health Organization (WHO) reports that 1.7 milion people died of tuberculosis in 2006. with 200.000 dying from HIVassociated TB. The TB germ is constantly changing and drug resistant strains have been found in 28 countries on 6 continents. Our current TB Vaccine. BCG. is more than 85 years old and is not compatible -against pulmonary TB. which accounts for most TB cases. Even right here in the United States. it is estimated that 10 to 15 million people in the U.S. have latent TB. Therefore. developing a vaccine has important implications both internationally and domestically.. Studies also show that the ten year economic benefits of a TB vaccine that was only 75 percent effective could result in an estimated savings of $25 billion. no one can deny that this is a significant amount. This legislation is a good start in our critical battle against TB and we as a legislative body need to continue to work on TB efforts both internationally and right here at home. I strongly urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n',rise today strong support tuberculosis important piece legislation outline effort combat devastate effect tuberculosis global community encouraged bill declare tuberculosis control major objective foreign assistance programsparticulary bill encourage development vaccine lead killer people explosion_drugresistant threaten halt roll progress combat disease fact report milion people die tuberculosis die germ change drug resistant_strain find country continent current more year old compatible -against pulmonary account most case estimate people latent develop vaccine important implication study show year economic benefit vaccine percent effective result estimate saving one deny significant amount legislation good start critical battle legislative body need continue work effort home urge colleague support bill.\n,110.0,daily,0,1

The legislation is the most innovative and comprehensive solution to the housing crisis yet. It will give relief to the millions of working families struggling to pay their mortgage with the rising price of gas and food. It would help nearly 1.5 million Americans in need.

I. too. greatly respect the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. GOoDLiNG3. but I do want to dissent from one thing he said. He indicated that he thought labor and management are working more closely today than ever before. That certainly is not the view from where I sit. When I grew up. we did have. I think. an era of good feeling between organized labor and management. I think in the 1980s it came to an end. and I am for this bill because I think it helps to restore incentives to settle rather than continuing incentives to fight. and I think there is no Incentive to settle unless the pain of a strike is equally distributed on both sides of the bargaining table. And I think this bill helps to redistribute that pain just a bit. However. Mr. Chairman. my main purpose in coming here today is to discuss the context in which this bill is being debated. Opponents talk about this bill as though we are abandoning something which has achieved great balance and fairness. The fact is we have had just the opposite in the 1980s. In the last 12 years we have had the greatest economic imbalance in this country of any decade since the 1920s. Here is what I mean: From 1980 through today the richest 1 percent of people in this country have had their incomes almost doubled. from $300.000 to about $550.000 today. Meanwhile a worker at exactly the middle of the income stream in this country has seen his wages decline by more than $1.000 in realdollar terms. in purchasing power. In 1960 the chief executive officer of the 100 largest corporations in this country. nonbanking corporations. on average earned 12 times as much as the average worker in their plant. Today that same CEO on average earns 72 times as much as the average worker in that plant. Since 1980 the income of the richest 1 percent of people in this society has increased by more than the income for 90 percent of American families combined. I ask if we can call that a balanced outcome. Mr. Chairman. If you take a look at the richest 1 percent of people in this country today. 2 2 million people. last year they made $565 billion. That is more than the combined incomes of 40 percent of all Americans. over 100 million Americans. That is the context in which we are addressing this bill. We are addressing it at a time when the average worker in this society. the average wage earner. has lost. in realdollar terms. more than $1 an hour in the purchasing power of his wage. Now this bill is not going to solve all of those problems obviously. We need more productivity increases. We need more training. We need more education. We need more investment to do that. But what this bill does is to help in a very small degree restore some sense of balance. some sense of equal power at the bargaining table. and I do believe that that will help contribute to a more fair outcome. and I do believe it will help contribute to an incentive on both sides to settle rather than to fight. The other point I would like to raise is that some people are saying. Isnt this terrible? This bill sets up one set of rules for unionized workers and another set of rules for other workers. I would point out that we cannot have it both ways. That is done in the amendment of the gentleman from Florida in order to accommodate business interests who are objecting because of the lack of clarity. who did not want nonunion labor to be covered. So. I do not think the business community can have it both ways. Mr. Chairman. I urge my colleagues to support the bill and oppose the amendment.\n',respect gentleman want dissent thing say indicate think labor management work today view sit grow think era good feeling organize labor management think 1980 come end bill think help restore incentive settle continue incentive fight think incentive settle pain strike distribute side bargaining_table think bill help redistribute pain bit main purpose come today discuss context bill debate opponent talk bill abandon achieve great balance fairness fact opposite 1980 last year great economic imbalance country decade mean today rich percent people country income double today worker middle income stream country see wage decline more realdollar_term purchase power chief executive officer large corporation country nonbanke corporation average earn time average worker plant today same ceo average earn time average worker plant income rich percent people society increase more income percent american family combine ask call balanced outcome take look rich percent people country today people last year make more combine income percent context address bill address time average worker society average wage_earner lose realdollar_term more hour purchasing_power wage bill go solve problem need more productivity increase need more training need more education need more investment bill help small degree restore sense balance sense equal power bargaining_table believe help contribute fair outcome believe help contribute incentive side settle fight other point like raise people say terrible bill set set rule unionized_worker set rule other worker point way do amendment gentleman order accommodate business interest object lack clarity want nonunion labor cover think business community way urge colleague support bill oppose amendment.\n,102.0,daily,0,1

Mr. President. the amendment in the nature of a substitute will. I believe. interfere seriously with the attainment of the objective of adequate and comparative compensation which is so necessary to the efficient functioning of Government. However. if the pay increases to be voted are based on hurried judgment rather than upon facts developed after careful study. history undoubtedly will repeat itself. By that I simply mean that the new rates of pay established. instead of setting an orderly pattern for future pay legislation. will serve but to invite a continuing scramble among agency and department heads and subordinate officials in future Congresses for piecemeal legislation which will take care of particular individuals without regard to the complete pay picture. Should this amendment in the nature of a substitute be enacted it would destroy for the majority of positions included in the bill the relationships which were established in the bills reported by the Senate Post Office and Civil Service Committee beginning with Senate bill In a number of instances it would establish discrepancies quite as glaring as any now existing. For instance. such major officials as the Administrator of Veterans Affairs. the Comptroller General. the chairman of the Munitions Board. and the Director of the Budget would be paid less than some of the administrative assistants to the President. Congress has recognized that $15.000 is not the proper ceiling for executive salaries where. the responsibilities and importance of duties are outstanding. With respect to the Administrator and Deputy Administrator of Economic Cooperation. for instance. compensation was set. under legislation passed April 3. 1948. at $20.000 and $17.500 respectively. also. the chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission. whose rate of pay was fixed at $17.500 in 1946. and the Administrator of the Housing and Home Finance Agency. whose compensation was fixed at $16.500 by amendment to the Housing Act on Much is made of the fact that some of the salary increases in the bill reported by the Senate committee would be large in comparison to the current compensation for the posts in question. In all justice. however. it must be borne in mind that the recent salary revision acts of the last 3 years have totally ignored the executive group in which many of the salaries have not been increased 1 cent in 25 or more years. Therefore. the increases proposed. as compared to the ridiculously low salaries now in effect. do loom large. The only criticism that can be leveled. however. is at the lack of attention to these salaries in recent years. For certainly the salalaries proposed. in comparison to positions of sometimes relatively minor importance in industry are still. if not adequate. at least anything but generous for the responsibilities involved. Under the measure as reported out by the Senate Committee on Post Office and Civil Service the total increases would be Just a fraction under onefourth million. It would be a slight investment. indeed. for the continuing dividends in increased competence among Government officials which would surely result. Under the committee reported bill positions of bureau chief rank would be paid at rates established under the Classification Act of 1923. as it was proposed to be amended by Senate bill 2379. The principles of concentrating on the heads and assistant heads of departments and. agencies have been indorsed by the Hoover Commission. the representatives of the executive branch. and employee organizations generally. and sponsored by the President of the United States. It would appear that the Congress would be taking a much wiser step if it were to accept the proposals which would preserve the relationships between the positions covered in the bill on the basis that they were established by the Post Office and Civil Service Committee after 2 years of intensive study of the problem. and consultation with persons in the executive branch. the Hoover Commission. and others who were in a position to advise them on the matter. It should be noted also that Congress. In passing House bill 5007. the military pay bill. has increased the salaries of the top level military staff to such an extent that the relationships in the military agencies particularly will be considerably distorted unless the bill is adjusted to follow the committees recommendations concerning the positions of the under and assistant secretaries of those departments. It will be most unfortunate. I believe. after all the thought and effort put into the development of the proposals embodied in the bill as reported by the committee. to accept a substitute which disregards the main purpose and intent of the movement to give adequate pay to high Federal officials on a coordinated and justly comparative basis.

I am pleased to* see that the House and Senate have finally worked out their differences to extend two programs that provide important health care assistance for lowincome elderly and working families. The Qualified Individual. 01. program provides assistance with the cost of Medicare premiums for certain lowincome individuals. The Transitional Medicaid Program. TMA. provides temporary Medicaid coverage to families moving off of welfare to the workforce. This legislation considered today merely provides a shortterm extension. I continue to believe. however. that these prqgrams should be made permanent. First. they are good programs that provide much needed assistance. Second. we should avoid the situation we find ourselves in now. particularly with respect to the QI program. where States and CMS were unsure whether or how to continue the program as funding expired on September30. We must also consider making program improvements to both programs that would simplify enrollment and retention of eligible individuals. I recently reintroduced legislation. H.R. 3980. the Medicare Beneficiary Assistance Improvement Act. to address this matter in the QI program. And I have also included such provisions for the TMA program in H.R. 2071. the Family Care Act of 2005. which I reintroduced earlier this year. Finally. I have concerns about the provision we are using to pay for these extensions. This provision strikes Medicare and Medicaid coverage of particular drugs that had been previously covered. The provision. in the out years. raises more revenue than is needed for these shortterm program extensions. We should have saved the remainder to use for another day. But despite these reservations. there is great urgency in extending the QI and TMA programs. so I am supporting the package.\n',pleased see work difference extend program provide important health_care assistance lowincome elderly work family program provide assistance cost premium certain lowincome individual provide temporary coverage family move welfare workforce legislation consider today provide shortterm_extension continue believe prqgram make permanent good program provide needed assistance avoid situation find respect program unsure continue program funding expire consider make program improvement program simplify enrollment retention eligible individual reintroduce legislation address matter program include such provision program reintroduce year concern provision use pay extension provision strike coverage particular drug cover provision out year raise more revenue need shortterm program extension save remainder use day reservation great urgency extend program support package.\n,109.0,daily,0,1

What does the gentleman believe that we are getting by embracing this package if the gentleman does. indeed. agree with me that to deploy 100 missiles is to deploy them in a vulnerable mode?

I think that deep down inside of every one of us. of every Member of Congress and of every citizen who on the one hand knows what that bill really contained and who on the other hand loves his country. there is a real sense of relief that this iniquitous legislation to lower taxes for the very rich in a veritable windfall and to lower them for the average wage earner by exactly 54 cents a week is a dead duck in this Congress and for this year. At the same time. however. many citizens are still unfamiliar with the details of the Republicansponsored tax bill which Mr. Truman twice was forced to veto as the wrong kind of bill at the wrong time. Many citizens. averageincome citizens. are still under the impression that this bill would have done them some real good. They recognize. of course. that the very rich would have reaped a windfall from it. but they thought that they would have received some substantial tax relief themselves. For that reason. I have had some tables prepared showing exactly what this taxreduction bill would have done. and showing it in terms everyone can understand. These tables show what the taxes were for various income groups in 1939. before we began raising taxes in preparation for defense and war needs. what they are now. and what they would have been under the twicevetoed tax bill. they show. further. what percentage of increase in a mans taxes since 1939 would have been removed. they show the percentage of increase in his takehome pay under the twicevetoed legislation. and they show what the actual increase in a taxpayers takehome pay would have been. both annually and. more important. by the week. I do not want to debate the twicevetoed tax bill at this late date in the proceedings. but I want to point out just one or two things these tables disclose so glaringly. They show. for instance. that the takehome pay increase for the average wage earner. the family man with two children. earning $2.500 a year. under this twicevetoed bill would have been the magnificent sum of 54 cents a week. whereas the man making $50.000 a year would have had a takehome pay increase of nearly $100 a week-$92.73. to be exactand the scale shoots up like that with the $100.000 a year man getting his weekly pay raised by this legislation by $239 a week. the $500.000 a year man getting a raise of $1.255 a week. and the $6.000.000 a year man taking home more than a half million dollars more a year. or $10.384 a week. This bill would have been good for him. fine and dandy. Another tabulation. equally revealing. shows how the lowerincome groupsnot poor people. but average wage earners earning about $50 a week or sowould have had about 30 percent of their increase in taxes since 1939 removed by this legislation. whereas the topincome groups. those making $250.000 up. would have had from 65 to 98 percent of their wartime increases in tax rates wiped off the books. Another tabulation shows how the persons earning up to $8.000 would have had their takehome pay increased by from 1 percent to less than 4 percent by this bill. whereas those in the very high brackets would have had their takehome pay increased anywhere from 20 to 62 percent. That is a big percentage of increase in takehome pay. I should say. I should also say that had these fortunate taxpayers in the very high brackets succeeded in getting their tax windfall as proposed by the Republican Party. they certainly would have felt obliged to show their appreciation in an appropriate manner to the Republican campaign next year. I have got another table here which I also ask unanimous consent to have printed in the RzCORD with these remarks. It shows how many taxpayers there are in each income classification in Pennsylvania. It is also very interesting. especially in relation to this tax bill. It shows that there were 3.299.341 taxpayers in the State in the tax year 1943. They are the best figuresthe latest figuresI could readily obtain and they may be a little out of date. But they are symptomatic. They show that of these 3.299.341 taxpayers in 1943. all but 103.563 earned less than $5.000. that is. about 3 percent earned more than $5.000 a year and about 97 percent earned less. Yet you will notice from these previous tables that the big windfalls come at the very narrow funnel end up in that group of 3 percent. with those at the very top getting the gravy whereas other taxpayers. even those earning up to $8.000 a year would get a weekly takehome pay raise of less than $5 a week. and the average worker getting only 54 cents a week more. There are 2.723.813 taxpayers out of the 3.299.341 of 1943 who earned less than $3.000 a year and whose tax reduction would amount to 54 cents or a dollar ten or so a week and none of them would have gotten as much as $2 a week more to spend. Mr. President. that means 82 percent of all Pennsylvania taxpayers would have gotten nickles and dimes in tax reductions. to a maximum of $1.87 a week for a single man earning $3.000 a year. but most of them getting $1.10 or 54 cents a week more. Another sizable group. 15 percent. earning from $3.000 to $5.000. would have gotten their taxes reduced by from $1.10 a weekabout $57 a yearup to. at the most. $3.56 for a single man earning $5.000. Most. of course. even in this group would get less. At the other end of the scale. among the top 3 percent earning $5.000 a year or more. are 2.619 taxpayers whose incomes in 1943 were $50.000 a year or more. Now this is a sizable number of big income earners in that class. and most of them are good Republicans and many are good contributors to the GOP. Yet. although .they make up only a tiny fraction of 1 percent of all taxpayers In Pennsylvania. they would be the only group which would really feel the taxrelief advantages of the Republican bill to any substantial degree. and they would feel it to the tune of an increase in their takehome pay of from $92.73 a week up to somewhere in the neighborhood of $7.000 or $8.000 or more a week to spend. Of course there are only a very few at the very top to receive such a tremendous tax reduction. but there would be 2.600 taxpayers in Pennsylvania enjoying at least $5.000 more a year to spend while 2.723.813 Pennsylvania taxpayers have from $28 to $97 more to spend. And new State taxes will eat up most of the increased spending money the average taxpayers in Pennsylvania would have received under this wrongwrong twicevetoed tax grab bill of the Republican Party.

So that is the reason why we arrived at that. I am sure if there is anything of great consequence as this debate proceeds in closed session. we could ask unanimous consent to extend the closed session a little while longer if anyone felt he needed to raise a question that could be raised only In closed session. Mr. President. I would like to yield myself 5 minutes and then yield to the Senator from Florida who has been seeking recognition on my time. I believe the Senator from Idaho also would like to speak. As a matter of fact. I will use less than 5 minutes. I think the Senator from Connecticut made a very. very eloquent case for Saudi Arabia in the sense that he pointed out. I think very accurately. the jeopardy which Saudi Arabia is in as a consequence of her neighbors. But I think you could take. you can take. the very facts he cited as some of the most eloquent arguments for going forward with the sales at this time. It seems to me that the Senator stated several things. and I hope I do not misstate what I assume he was saying or what he is saying. First of all. the Senator from Connecticut pointed out that Saudi Arabias longterm interests in the Middle East lie in her alliance with the Israelis. the Egyptians. and the Iranians. and I doubt whether many people would argue with that. and ultimately her longterm interests lie with the United States of America because her longterm and shortterm detriment lies to the north. the Soviet Union. If that. in fact. is the case. it seems to me that the next step to be considered and the question to be asked is the one raised by the Senator from Washington about what relevance do 60 F15s have to that security interest now. I think all of us here would have to acknowledge in light of the fact that they are not going to even come onstream until 1983 or 1984. and even if they were coming onstream now. that is not enough for the Saudis to look out for their own interests. so we are back again to how do we ultimately arrive at that alliance of Saudi Arabia. Egypt. Israel. and Iran. It seems to me the only way we arrive at that is through peace in the Middle East in terms of the ArabIsraeli conflict. because until that point is arrived at the Israelis and the Saudi Arabians will not be able to move jointly against the perceived and real threat to Saudi Arabia. I think there are few in here who would deny that this package. this sale. of the 60 F15s to Saudi Arabia at least is exacerbating her relationship with Israel. at least is doing that. and most of us have agreed in open session here that the main thrust of this debate is really not the military force structure as a consequence of this sale but the psychological reaction each nation will have as a consequence of our actions. The point I am trying to get to. and I probably am taking longer than the 5 minutes I allotted to myself. it seems to me is if this sale would take us further away from a peace settlement in the Middle East. it takes us further away from securing Saudi Arabias interest. It seems to me further that in terms of Middle East alliances. the single most important military ally to Saudi Arabia is Israel. But if Israel at this point perceives. rightly or wrongly. that as a consequence of our actions we are either withdrawing the covenant we have had with the Israelis and the special relationship or as a consequence of this action they believe they are in jeopardy or at least more jeopardy than they were before with the combined forces in the Arab world. with Saudi Arabia being put in a position if. in fact. there is another war they will not be able to stand back with these planes in their arsenal and say to the more radical Arab nations. ""We cannot get involved. we canot be there."" they become a confrontation state. If either of those two things occurs. that is. that Israel believes that Saudi Arabia is a real shortterm threat to her interests or that they believe this heralds the beginning of an era of a change in our relationship with them. it seems to me that moves them further from the peace table. it moves them further from the point of making some necessary concessions I believe they must make. Israel. and I believe. many of us believe. that. and if that is the case. then Saudi Arabias interests are. in fact. jeopardized more by the sale even though we all should sit here and say: ""If only the Israelis knew better. if only the Israelis would not react that way."" Well. I think we cannot react based on what we think should happen. I think we should react based on what we feel will happen. As the distinguished Senator from Colorado asked me earlier today in the open debate. could I predict what the Saudis will do if these sales do not go throigh. I said I could not do that. but I think we can more accurately predict what the Israelis will do if the sales go through. rightly or wrongly. it seems to me all the evidence indicates the Israelis will harden in their position. If you want to ask the negative aspect to this. will they become more paranoid instead of less paranoid? Will they become less trusting instead of more trusting? Will they move further away from the table rather than closer to the table? And we answer: ""We will solve that. we will send the Israelis 20 more planes."" By sending the Israelis 20 more planes. and we said we were not going to do it. we are tacitly acknowledging that the fear they had in the first instance. which may not be justified. is more justified. One last thing: It seems one other thing I know is not very palatable to say in open session. and I was criticized for alluding to it this morning by one of my colleagues. and that is they are saying what will Saudi Arabia do if we do not. Let me ask it the other way: What can Saudi Arabia do if we do not? I realize that injures pride. it injures their attitude in terms of their own sovereignty and whether or not they are a powerful nation. But. practically speaking. folks. what can they do if we do not. assuming that the argument made by the Senator from Connecticut is true. which I think it is. and that is that Saudi Arabia is in jeopardy? They must look West and not East. they must look moderate rather than radical. they must look to the United States rather than the Soviets for their own interests.\n'",yield point main reason make suggestion guess think opponent resolution want use more time closed session want use only reason want bind have use hour total hour closed session reason arrive sure great consequence debate proceed closed session ask_unanimous consent extend closed session little while feel need raise question raise closed session like yield minute yield seek recognition time believe like speak matter fact use less minute think make eloquent case sense point think jeopardy consequence neighbor think take take very fact cite eloquent argument go sale time seem state several thing hope misstate assume say say point longterm interest lie alliance doubt many people argue longterm interest lie longterm shortterm detriment lie north fact case seem next step consider question ask one raise relevance f15s security interest think acknowledge light fact go come onstream come onstream enough look own interest arrive alliance seem only way arrive peace term conflict point arrive able move perceive real threat think few deny package sale_f15s least exacerbate relationship least do most agree open session main_thrust debate military force structure consequence sale psychological reaction nation consequence action point try get take minute allot seem sale take peace settlement take secure interest seem term alliance single important military ally point perceive consequence action withdraw covenant special relationship consequence action believe jeopardy more jeopardy combine force arab world put position fact war able stand plane arsenal say radical arab nation get involve canot become confrontation state thing occur believe real shortterm threat interest believe herald beginning era change relationship seem move peace table move point make necessary concession believe make believe many believe case interest fact jeopardize sale sit say know react way think react base think happen think react base feel happen distinguished ask today open debate predict sale go throigh say think predict sale go seem evidence indicate harden position want ask negative aspect become paranoid paranoid become trust more trusting move table close table answer solve send more plane send more plane say go acknowledge fear first instance justify justified last thing seem other thing know palatable say open session criticize allude morning colleague say let ask other way realize injure injure attitude term own sovereignty powerful nation speak folk assume argument make true think jeopardy look look moderate radical look own interests.\n,95.0,bound,0,1

I never have been able to see how borrowing money by our Government. and its expenditure for workrelief labor. could ever raise commodity prices in this country to the level of 1926. which we seek. In fact. it has not done so. I think the time should very quickly come when this policy should cease. but I do not believe it ever will cease unless some action is taken by Congress to restore the price level of commodities in this country. We certainly have some control over our monetary agents in this country. It would seem that we should have some control over the Federal Reserve Board. and some control over the Treasury Department. If we have not. we should have. It is perfectly evident that the Federal Reserve Board. In connection with the Secretary of the Treasury. in the latter part of 1936 and the early part of 1937. caused the recession of 1938. as It is called. and did it deliberately. In the latter part of 1936 and the early part of 1937 commodity prices in this country had reached nearly the parity of 1926. As a matter of fact. farm commodity prices had reached 96. as compared with 100. which meant that the purchasing power of the dollar was down to 101. Within a few months after that commodity prices were driven down 24 percent. and they are down at that point now. The general prices of agricultural products were driven down more than 24 percent. and they are there now. We have tried every kind of scheme to save agriculture. We have paid the farmers to reduce their production. we have paid them bonuses in the form of loans. Yet it has not affected their commodity prices at all. and unless something is done to affect commodity prices. the present condition is bound to last forever. Let us look at what Mr. Eccles. the great genius in bharge of the Federal Reserve Board. said in his report at the end of 1936. This is a splendid report. In 1936 it looked as though we were not going to have any unemployment in 1937 and 1938. it looked as though the prices of all commodities would reach 100. I want Senators to listen to this report for just a moment. On page 3 of the Annual Report of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Board for 1936 we find the following: ""Progress In industry and trade was substantial in 1936. Production of durable goods increased considerably. and output of nondurable products also showed growth. particularly in the latter half of the year."" I am reading from a great monetary and economic genius. and I hope to conclude in a moment: ""The increase in durablegoods production reflected purchases of equipment both by industry and by individuals. as well as further expansion in construction. There was a general rise in employment. and income in both urban and rural areas was considerably .larger than in other recent years. Capital values increased during the year. and in the latter part of the year there was a general advance in commodity prices. Total national income rose to $63.800.000.000 for the year. as compared with $55.000.000.000 in 1935 and a low of $39.500.000.000 in 1932."" That was a splendid showing. On page 2 of the report we find the following: ""During 1936. however. business drew upon the banks and upon investors funds to a considerably larger extent. Commercial loans to bank customers. after 3 years of little change. increased by $1.000.000.000. and securities issued by corporations to obtain new capital (as distinct from refunding issues) amounted to $1.200.000.000 or more than the aggregate for the previous 4 years combined."" The same story of prosperity proceeds. On page 1 of the report for the year 1937 we find the following: ""At the opening of 1937 economic activity was increasing rapidly. The output of mines and factories. after a steady rise for 2 years. had reached the average level of 1929. Increased activity was manifested both in the industries producing goods for immediate consumption and in those producing durable goods. Capital expenditures by manufacturing industries were increasing rapidly. in line with output and profits. There was some revival in residential construction. which had dwindled to a very low level during the depression and was still far from normal. Employment was expanding and wage payments were rising even more rapidly as the result both of reduction in parttime employment and of increases in hourly wage rates. Increased farm income. a large volume of dividend disbursements. and larger wage payments resulted in an Increase in retail and wholesale distributions. Prices of securities were at the highest level since the early part of the depression. yields on bonds. both Government and corporate. had reached exceptionally low levels. and capital issues of corporations were in the largest volume of the recovery years. Many commodity prices were rising rapidly. Advances were particularly pronounced in agricultural and other raw materials. prices of finished goods were also rising. Increased domestic demand. together with a considerable volume of foreign demand. contributed to the advance. A wave of buying was in progress. * * * ""Relative to bank loans and the expansion of deposit currency. the Board reports as follows from page 2: The total volume of bank deposits and currency continued to grow and at the beginning of 1937 was at the highest level in the countrys history. Bank loans to trade and industry had increased considerably and were growing. New York City banks were reducing their holdings of Government securities. but total investments of banks had changed little in the last half of 1936. Idle funds In the hands of institutions and individual investors continued large. and longterm money rates were exceptionally low."" On page 3 of the 1937 report we find the following assertion: ""Currency outside of banks had increased by about $2.000.000.000 between 1930 and 1937."" That is where currency must be to have any effect. Now comes the report of the destruction of that prosperity. an admission on the part of Mr. Eccles that the Board deliberately destroyed that prosperity. Yet I have never heard anything said in Congress against it. I have heard of no effort in Congress to control a situation of that kind. We are concerning ourselves with a feared waste of $50.000.000. when the act of the Federal Reserve Board struck down billions of dollars worth of capital in this country with one blow. We are talking now about saving the taxpayers money. and in my opinion. there is not a thing that we are talking about which has anything whatever to do with the restoration of the price level. This is what the Federal Reserve Board did in conspiracy with the Treasury Department. On page 2 of the 1937 report we find the following: ""The rate of advance in business activity was. in fact. so fast that there were evidences of unsound developments."" There is the whole secret. There were evidences of unsound development. Prosperity was moving forward too rapidly to suit them. and there was threat of a boom. Yet there were 8.000.000 unemployed in this country at the time of that socalled threat of a boom. I read further: ""There was a large increase in forward orders in anticipation of further price and wage increases. together with uncertainties regarding deliveries. partly due to labor disputes. and shortages were developing in plant and equipment and in some classes of skilled labor. Notwithstanding the fact that recovery was far from complete and that there was still a large amount of unemployment. boom conditions were developing in particular industries and boom psychology began to be manifested."" Then what happened? On page 1 of the report of 1936 we find that the Board took action to check the upswing. This is what it reported: ""In July 1936 and again in January 1937 the Board of Governors took action to increase reserve requirements and thereby to eliminate a large part of the excess reserves that had accumulated. The combined effect of these two actions of the Board was to double the reserve requirements of member banks. Thus the power conferred upon the Board by the Banking Act of 1935 to Increase reserve requirements for the purpose of preventing injurious credit expansion was fully utilized. ""In December 1936 the United States Treasury inaugurated a policy of setting aside in an inactive stock all gold purchased subsequent to December 23. 1936. and thereby preventing the further acquisition of gold from Increasing bank reserves. The Treasury and Federal Reserve measures taken together largely eliminated the basis of a potential credit expansion arising from the larga movement of gold to this country which had begun in 1934 and had greatly expanded the credit base of the country."" Again. on page 2 of the 1937 report the Board reported that the Treasury Department joined in the program which had the effect of curtailing and checking the return of prosperity. I read: ""In December the United States Treasury. after consultation with the Board. adopted a policy of placing new gold acquisitions in an inactive account. thus preventing further gold imports from adding to the reserves of member banks."" On page. 3 of the 1937 report we find the following: ""In August 1936 the Board of Governors had raised reserve requirements for member banks by 50 percent in order to absorb a part of the $3.000.000.000 of reserves in excess of requirements held by member banks. Under the law the Board has the responsibility of changing reserve requirements in order to prevent injurious credit expansion or contraction. and the Board had acted to eliminate from the credit base a part of the redundant reserves accumulated through a large volume of gold imports. The Boards action was in the nature of a precautionary measure to prevent an uncontrollable expansion of credit in. the future. The policy of maintaining easy money and credit conditions pursued by the System since the beginning of the depression continued to be In effect."" On page 3 of the 1936 report we find the following: ""The Board. therefore. in January and March 1936. took action to increase the margin requirements applicable to security loans made by brokers and dealers in securities and in March also made these requirements. as increased. applicable to loans made by banks on stocks for the purpose of purchasing or carrying stocks registered on national securities exchanges. By these measures the Board undertook to check the growing use of borrowed funds for speculation in securities. without limiting the supply or raising the cost of credit available for commercial. industrial. or agricultural purposes."" Senators. watch the development and see what happens. See what happens with this control of our monetary system. I continue to read from the 1937 report. page 8: ""About the middle of March prices of stocks and of lowergrade corporate bonds began to decline from the high levels to which they had risen. Advance buying by industry and trade slackened. and early in April prices of commodities traded on organized exchanges began to decline. During the summer increases in crop production contributed to the declines in prices of cotton and grains. while livestock prices advanced. Industrial output continued large. however. ""reflecting to a considerable extent the filling of orders previously received. In the spring months there was a decline in offerings of securities for refunding purposes which had been in record volume in the early part of 1936 when business organizations. particularly the public utilities. were taking advantage of the prevailing low level of money rates to reduce the cost of their indebtedness."" Here is the end of the story on page 10 of the 1937 report: ""As a consequence of these developments industrial production declined at an exceptionally rapid rate. and the Boards index. which had averaged 116 in the first 8 months of the year. fell to 84 In December. There were also sharp declines in factory employment and pay rolls. Movement of goods over the railroads was reduced and. with costs at a higher level. the earning prospects and financial positions of many railroads were impaired. In the commodity markets prices of raw materials and semifinished products showed widespread rapid declines. and prices of finished goods. which had risen somewhat further during the summer. also decreased. In December prices of some raw materials continued to decline but others. including steel scrap and cotton. advanced. Reductions in incomes were reflected toward the end of the year In reduced consumer buying of automobiles. furniture. and other durable goods. Residential building. which earlier in the year had decreased as a consequence primarily of higher building costs. declined further in the autumn. as uncertainties arose regarding income prospects. At this time there were some reductions in buildings costs. but with business activity declining people were reluctant to build new houses or buy old ones."" There is the history of the rise in 1936 and 1937. and there is the history of the decline down to the present time. The Federal Reserve Board. which has extraordinary control over the monetary affairs of the United States. conceived in 1936. at a time when there were 8.000.000 unemployed persons in this country. at a time when the price levels had not yet reached those of 1926. that there was a boom. and that conditions were unsound. and the Board took every step in its power to stop the boom. and it did stop the boom. and put conditions where they are now. and since the conditions were brought to that point the Board has taken no action to overcome the wrong and the destruction it did. Instead of that. we have Mr. Eccles. in a very confused and pitiful way. writing a letter to the Committee on BankIng and Currency. saying there have been very many disagreements on both sides. and that they would be very happy to have the Committee on Banking and Currency suggest to the Board what they should do. Mr. President. there is no question what they should do. They cannot control the credit of this country. because a depositor in a bank will not use his money to buy anything so long as he thinks there is a deflationary movement under way and prices are going down. A bank for the same reason will not lend money so long as it believes there is a deflationary movement and prices are going down. Let the depositor think that prices are going up and he will buy. and the bank will join him in lending. The Board has no control over the banks credit. It has control over the currency in this country. Every time the suggestion is made that the Government use its function In issuing currency. business and banking institutions have been taught to be afraid and they are afraid that something will happen to our currency similar to what happened to the German mark. Therefore. the Board does not know what to do. It will say that there is just as much currency in this country now as there was in 1929. That is true. But where is it? In 1929 it was in the hands of the people. At the present time it is hoarded by the bankson one hand and hoarded by the depositors on the other. Mr. Eccles tells us that in 1936 not only were deposits moving freely but currency in circulation out of the banks increased. I say ""in circulation."" I do not mean in circulation as the Treasury considers It to be when it is merely outside of the Treasury. I. mean in circulation out of the Treasury and outside the banks. The deposits at the present time are hoarded. It would make no difference if there were $20.000.000.000 in currency registered in the Treasury reports as being in circulation. which would simply mean that it was outside the .Treasury. if all of it were hoarded in banks. both by the banks and the depositors. But there is no doubt that when the Thomas amendment to the agricultural bill was agreed to. authorizing the United States Treasury to issue and spend $3.000.000.000 in Treasury notes. it had an inflationary effect. Why? Because. as Jimmie Warburg said. there had never before been such an inflationary movement in this country as that. In addition. it provided another $3.000.000.000 which the Government might use to take up its current accounts. That made a total of $6.000.000.000. It was Jimmie Warburg who suggested that if such a bill were passed everyone who had a deposit would run out and buy something solidbuy commodities and real estateand there would be the greatest inflation in commodity values that the United States ever saw. That was exactly what we wanted to the point of reflation. But. Mr. President. none of that power was ever utilized by the President of the United States. He did not utilize the $3.000.000.000. And to make matters worse. as the inflationary period was coming. and the course of prosperity and commodity prices moved up. to July 1933. the Treasury Department again became frightened of boom. and deliberately issued a statement that there would be no inflation. and then prices dropped. There are many definitions and theories as to inflation and to what effect it will have on the prosperity of the country. For the information of the country.

Mr. Speaker. military life imposes grueling burdens on family life. Virtually all members .of the military are transferred from place to place every 2 or 3 years. This means that the spouse and children have to abandon old friends and made new ones. leave old jobs and find new ones. leave the. old house and find a new one. They become resentful and ask the member of the military why he or she doesnt quit and take a job which does not require this continual dislocation. To make matters worse. each move costs the family money. The amount of reimbursement the Government provides is just plain inadequate. Further. military service sometimes Involves long periods of separation. Spouses are understandably upsetwhen they learn that their sailor spouses are off on a 6month cruise. And. military service sometimes involves danger. We cannot maintain a peacetime military of 2.2 million individuals by shutting our eyes to the very real conflicts and difficulties of military family life. The conference report before us today confronts the problem and contains some meaningful solutions. Title VIII of the legislation is the Military Family Act of 1985. Section 802 creates an Office of Family Policy which is established to coordinate and study military family programs and policies. I expect that this office will tell us what further legislation is needed to reduce the pressure on military families. Section 806 is a very strong provision to help spouses of members of the military find jobs when they are transferred from place to place. The section tells the President to order measures to increase the employment opportunities for spouses. The provision suggests exempting from the competitive service positions abroad and providing preference in nonappropriated fund jobs. Further. the sectjon mandates that spouses be given preference for any position above GS7. This means that. where a spouse makes the certificate of the top three applicants qualified for a position. the spouse must be selected unless a preference eligible is also on the list. The suggested steps for the President are not exhaustive. He has considerable authority under title 5. United States Code. to provide for noncompetitive appointment of spouses in Federal jobs. The President should use this authority. No issue is of greater concern to military spouses than the ability to get a job. And members of the military have better morale when their spouses are able to get jobs. . Other sections in title VIII make more reasonable the cost of housing. authorize the use of relocation services. reduce food costs at messes for junior enlisted families. and provide for reporting of child abuse cases. Title VI of the bill contains a number of important new allowances which will ease the burden of military life on families. Most important. section 612 raises the level of travel and per diem reimbursement to the level that civil service employees receive. This is crucial if service members are not to lose money each time they move. Yet. I was distressed to note that the Appropriations Committee decided not to fund these higher levels. I. therefore. intend to offer an amendment to the Defense appropriations bill to provide the additional $193 million needed to pay the higher amounts and to reduce procurement accounts across the board to pay for it. Title VI also has provisions allowing for the advance payment of housing allowances to cover rent deposits. doubles the family separation payment from $30 to $60 a month. doubles the dislocation allowance from 1 months basic pay to 2. makes temporary lodging expenses an entitlement. and expands the allowances for baggage and transportation of household effects. Of particular note. section 651 established a program to. pay for dental benefits for spouses and children under CHAMPUS. This program would allow for sharing of premium co8ts between the Department and the beneficiaries. This benefit is strongly desired and can be provided at low cost. The bill allows the program to be set up during fiscal year 1986 and to be Implemented in the next year. Title VII of the bill revises and strengthens the survivor benefit plan under military retirement. The percentage cost of providing a survivor benefit will not increase with inflation because section 714 indexes the base amount for reduction. Section 716 permits the coverage of both a former spouse and a child. Section 721 requires the concurrence of a spouse or former spouse before survivors benefits can be waived. And. section 722 clarifies that spousal agreements dividing property and survivor benefits are enforceable. All of these changes will help protect both spouses and former spouses from being left destitute after divorce or the death of the military member. We still have a long way to go to making family life and military life compatible. Yet. this bill makes giant strides in that direction.\n',thank gentleman yield time military life impose grueling burden family life member military transfer place place year mean spouse child abandon old friend make new one leave old job find new one leave find new one become resentful ask member military quit take job require continual dislocation make matter bad move cost family money amount reimbursement provide inadequate military service involve long period separation spouse learn sailor spouse cruise service involve danger maintain peacetime military individual shut eye real conflict difficulty military family life conference report today confront problem contain meaningful solution title legislation section create establish coordinate study military family program policy expect office tell further legislation need reduce pressure military family section strong provision help spouse member military find job transfer place place section tell order measure increase employment opportunity spouse provision suggest exempt competitive service position provide preference nonappropriate_fund job sectjon mandate spouse give preference position mean spouse make certificate top applicant qualified position spouse select preference eligible list suggest step exhaustive considerable authority title provide noncompetitive appointment spouse federal job use authority issue great concern military spouse ability get job member military well morale spouse able get job other section title make reasonable cost housing authorize use relocation service reduce food cost mess junior enlist family provide reporting child abuse case bill contain number important new allowance ease burden military life family important section raise level travel diem_reimbursement level civil service employee receive crucial service member lose money time move distressed note decide fund high level intend offer amendment appropriation bill provide additional need pay high amount reduce procurement account board pay provision allow advance payment housing allowance cover rent deposit double family separation payment month double dislocation allowance month basic pay make temporary_lodging expense entitlement expand allowance baggage transportation household effect particular note section establish program pay dental benefit spouse child program allow sharing premium beneficiary benefit desire provide low cost bill allow program set fiscal year implement next year bill revise strengthen survivor benefit plan military retirement percentage cost provide survivor benefit increase inflation section index base amount reduction section permit coverage former spouse child section require concurrence spouse former spouse survivor benefit waive section clarifie spousal agreement divide property survivor benefit enforceable change help protect spouse former spouse leave destitute divorce death military member long way go make family life military life compatible bill make giant_stride direction.\n,99.0,daily,0,1

I could not agree more with the comments that were made by the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee relative to the importance of America investing in its future. and education is one of the most fundamental ways in which we are able to shape our future. by assuring that our young people are fully prepared to meet the challenges of this exciting new century. It was for that reason that I supported this legislation when it was reported with a bipartisan vote from the Senate Finance Committee. I also supported it because it recognized another aspect of our responsibility to the future. and that is to act in a fiscally prudent manner. particularly at this rare moment of opportunity we have before us today. The U.S. Government had its last surplus in 1969. We then had 30 years of deficit financing. Our national debt went from 1979s little better than $900 billion to 1999s national debt of almost $5.5 trillion. That is trillion with a T. That is the extent of the profligate fiscal policy in which this country has engaged for the better. part of three decades. But in the last few years. we have started to get seriously committed to not asking our children and grandchildren to pay our debts. and the result of that has been a dramatic reduction in our annual deficits to the point that now we are. for the first time in over three decades. in a surplus position. We have made a decisionand I hope we will stay faithful to that decisionthat we will commit all of the surplus which is generated from Social Security to the reduction in the national debt as the means by which we can make our greatest contribution to the longterm solvency of the Social Security system. Second. we would husband the nonSocial Security surplus to use against a set of yettobedetermined national priorities. My concern is that the pattern we are now followingand I amgoing to give a little history of. what has happened in the past few monthsis that we are dissipating that opportunity to use the nonSocial Security surplus against a set of national priorities by an incremental approach. A good idea or an appealing idea is presented. and we say: We will buy that. and we will pay for it out of the nonSocial Security surplus. Then a few days later anothergood idea comes along and we say: We would like to buy that. too. well pay for it from- the nonSocial Security surplus. Do you know what is going to happen? It will not be long before there isnt any credit line left in that nonSocial Security surplus. We will awaken and say: There were some really big things we needed to do. We have a contract out herea contract between the Federal Government and the people of America for their Social Security. Right now. our ability to meet that contract. even with the investment we are going to make in reducing the national debt. is very uncertain. We should be using some of this nonSocial Security surplus to help shore up our longterm ability to meet that contractual -obligation. But because we spent all the nonSocial Security surplus on these incremental piecebypiece. toybytoy ideas. we will not have any money when we want to give America a big gift. the security of the Social Security system. We also are not going to have any money to do other important things for which we have a contract with the American people. such as to assure there will be a health care system for our older citizens. We know the Medicare system. as Social Security. has some very daunting challenges facing it in the next few decades. as the number of eligible Americans for Medicare and Social Security will double. Yet we will not have the resources to make that kind of a commitment. To focus on this specific issue. as I indicated earlier. I voted for this bill when it was reported from the Finance Committee because I thought it made good education policy but also because it was paid for. We were not asking future generations to sacrifice the nonSocial Security surplus to pay for this program. We found some means within our current spending and taxing policy to generate the resources to pay for this program. We thought this program was important enough to pay for it. not ask our grandchildren to pay for it..I think that is not a failure. that is a statement of the seriousness of our intention. It is a lot easier to buy something somebody else has to pay for than to buy something you have to go into your own bank account and write that check to pay for. That is a statement of. an important and serious commitment to the objective. We had made that statement of the seriousness of this goal by our willingness to pay for it. We are proposing to do two things: One. make it substantially more expensive. and. two. not pay for it. My amendment does a simple thing. that is. it says we should at least. at a minimum. keep in this bill those items that would help to pay for it. which the Senate Finance Committee. just a matter of a few weeks ago. found to be an appropriate method of financing this program. Let me put that simple principle into the context of what we are doing. First. we are making a series of significant fiscal decisions before we have adopted the budget resolution. For those who are new or unfamiliar with this process. the Congress. as one of its earliest efforts to get a handle on the 30 years of deficits. adopted a complex budget process which has. as its linchpin. a congressionally adopted budget resolution. That resolution would be analogous to an architects set of plans for constructing a building. It gives the general direction. framework. and prioritization of Federal fiscal policy each year. Those priorities then drivethe individual appropriations and tax measures which will support that architectural plan. We have not yet seen the architectural plan for fiscal year 2001 which will be affected by this measure. and. therefore. we do not know what within that plan is going to be the provision for taxandspending measures that would support this educational proposal. We do not know what will be the scale of the nonSocial Security surplus. We do know this: The scale of the nonSocial Security surplus could be as much as $1 trillion from the high to the low estimate. That depends largely on what is going to be our spending appetite. In the next 10 years. if we spend at the same rate we did in the last year. for the year 2000 fiscal budget. according to CBO. we are going to end up with a budget surplus of approximately $838 billion over the next 10 years for the nonSocial Security account. If we go back to the budget caps we adopted in 1997which I supported last -year. and for that reason I voted against the omnibus appropriations billwe would have a surplus over the next 10 years of about $1.9 trillion. Those are the two extremes of the resources we will have. Yet before deciding that fundamental question: Are we going to be dealing with a surplus of $838 billion or are we going to be dealing with a surplus of $1.9 trillion? we are making decisions as to how to distribute the surplus. Second. this is not the first example of that spending. Let me catalog what we have already done. In the Patients Bill of Rights billand today is the start of its conferencewe have proposed to spend $30 billion over 10 years of nonSocial Security surplus in various tax reductions. The bankruptcy billwhich has passed both Houses. and which is or soon will be in conferenceproposes to have tax cuts of $103 billion. The educational savings billthe bill before us todaywith the amendment the Senator from Delaware has proposed. would have a cost of approximately $13 billion. I use the word ""approximately"" because several of the measures that are in this bill or may be proposed to the bill have not been scored by the Congressional Budget Office. The marriage penalty bill. which passed the House. has a cost of $182 billion over the next 10 years. If we were to reject the House approach and adopt the legislation which has been introduced in the Senate Finance Committee. and which was contained in last years Taxpayers Refund Act of 1999. that would increase the cost of the marriage penalty to $311 billion over 10 years. The consequence of what we have already done. using the conservative level on the marriage penalty. is we have already spent approximately $328 billion of our $838 billion. 10year. nonSocial Security surplusbefore we have adopted a budget resolution. before we have decided how much of the nonSocial Security surplus should be used for priorities such as strengthening Social Security.and assuring its solvency for three generations. before we have made a decision. as to how much should be spent on strengthening Medicare and modernizing Medicare- so it represents the kind of health care program our older Americans deserve. before we have made decisions on what our defense budget should be in order to protect the security of America. All of those things have gone undecided. Yet we have decided to spend $328 billion on this collection of taxandspending measures before we havean architectural plan. It would be similar to the family who wants to build a house. and before they have the architect draw the plans for the house. they decide. ""We will go ahead and put in an attic family room."" without any context of how that is going to relate to the rest of the house. It is always fun to be able to spend your money on those things that are joyful and happy without having to put your mind to the task of deciding what is of greatest importance. My amendment is a very modest one. It proposes to put back into the bill exactly the same items which were in the bill when it left the Senate Finance Committee. Let me briefly mention what those items are. First is a modification of the foreign tax credit carryover rules. This has a financial impact of $3.6 billion over 10 years. I point out that this is not a new idea for the Senate to consider. In fact. the Senate has already passed this bill. first in 1997. as part of the Taxpayer Relief Act. in 1998. as part of the IRS restructuring program. in 1998. as part of the Parent and Student Savings Act. in 1999. as part of the Taxpayer Refund and Relief Act. and in 1999. as part of work incentives. It appears from that record that the Senate has studied. is aware of. knowledgeable of this tax issue and has decided this would be an appropriate measure to use as a partial offset for the educational savings account. The second measure is to limit use of the nonaccrual experience method of accounting. This would contribute $300 million over the next 10 years. That proposal was first adopted in 1999 as part of the Taxpayer Refund and Relief Act. passed in 1999 as part of the trade bill offset. and passed in 1999 as part of the Work Incentives Actagain. not a novel idea. an idea that the Senate has had repeated exposure to and repeatedly has found to be worthy. The third item is the extension of IRS user fees. This would produce $278 million over 10 years. This was passed as part of the 1999 Taxpayer Refund and Relief Act and the 1999 work incentives. The fourth item is to allow employers to transfer excess defined benefit assets. That would make a contribution of $156 million. That was included in the 1999 Taxpayer Refund and Relief Act. Finally. with a contribution of $1.2 billion over 10 years. is to impose a limitation on the prefunding of certain employee benefits. This passed the Senate in 1999 as part of the Taxpayer Refund and Relief Act and in 1999 as part of the Trade Act offset. These five items aggregate to $5.5 billion over 10 years. These items were part of the package that had the objective of fully funding the educational savings account so it would not contribute to any reduction in the nonSocial Security surplus when this bill passed the Senate Finance Committee. I do not represent that these items will fund the bill in its current form. because the bill has ballooned in cost since it has been on the Senate floor. I suggest we ought to first take this modest step of at least retaining the offsets that have already been voted by the Finance Committee and which are in the bill and then. before we take a final vote on this legislation. assess what the cost of this total program is as amended by the full Senate. and then find an offset to pay for those additional amounts. Failing to do so is to make a statement that we are prepared to spend the nonSocial Security surplus without any frame of reference. Without any budget resolution. without any architectural plan as to what we want to do. That is a prescription to return to the three decades of deficit spending which threatened the fiscal solvency and the economic future of this Nation. I believe it would be reckless for this Congress. having worked so hard to get to a surplus. not to now use this opportunity to make the hard decisions as to what is the priority for the use of this surplus and then to have the discipline to follow that set of priorities. Mr. President. I urge adoption of this amendment which will be a symbolic statement that we are prepared to exercise fiscal discipline in times of potential prosperity and plenty. just as we had to exercise fiscal discipline during the 1990s in order to remove ourselves from the quagmire of deficits and exploding national debt.\n'",agree comment make distinguished chairman relative importance invest future

It does one thing and one thing only. Mr. Chairman. this amendment would reduce from 2 years to 1 year the authorizations contained in this bill. with the exception of the Development Loan Fund and the Alliance for Progress. which are not touched by the amendment. I offer this for a number of reasons. Only on those two exceptions have we hitherto given multiyear authorizations. The remainder of the bill we have never before given more than a single year authorization. I am referring to economic not military aid. Also. if the Members will look on page 3 of the committee report. which has the table on the authorization requests. it becomes immediately apparent that no justifications for any fiscal year 1968 authorizations were given. We cannot find them in the hearings. We cannot find them in the report. I am not one who is unalterably opposed to multiyear authorizations. I for one will oppose any attempt to reduce the multiyear authorizations for the Development Loan Fund or for the Alliance for Progress. But. it seems to me. that if. even for administrative expenditures and these various other programs which do not have long leadtime factors. we are to decide to change the timehonored policy and proceed to a 2year authorization. then it ought to be done at the beginning of a new Congress and not at the end of an old Congress. This will have the effect of having a new Congress. convening in January. which will not have the chance to examine this or which will not be compelled to examine this until the second session of that Congress. This certainly is very poor practice. If we are going to have a 2year program. it seems to me the administration ought to come in with a 2year program. which it did not do. The administration request this year was for a 5year program and open ended authorization. which would have abdicated virtually any responsibility of our committee to determine what should be authorized. The committee wisely put dollar amounts on. The Members will notice that in some cases these amounts bear almost no resemblance to the budgeted amounts. even for 1967. but for 1968 we cannot find anything. I am not at all sure that we might not have granted much too much in some categories and too little in some other categories. But in any case we cannot find in the record any justification of what should be a proper amount. I submit we should return to the honored tradition of the House for a singleyear authorization. If there is to be a fundamental change in policy. I believe it should be considered by the new Congress in January.

I wish to call to the attention of the House this afternoon title II of H.R. 7300. the School Assistance Act of 1961. which would provide for a 3year extension of Public Laws 815 and 874 which expired June 30 of this year. In the clamor for the passage of a general act for Federal aid for school construction and teachers salaries. Congress must not lose sight of its responsibility to local school districts under programs long established. I refer specifically to those laws which provide Federal assistance to school districts burdened through activities of the Federal Government and termed ""impact areas."" As significant as are the broader programs envisaged in H.R. 7300. the continuation of the programs already begun under Public Law 815 and Public Law 874 is of equal and more immediate importance to the State of Washington and to other areas. Congress long has recognized the responsibility of the Federal Government to assist educational agencies in areas where the impact of Federal activity has imposed serious financial burdens. This financial impact is caused by concentrations of taxexempt installations which lower the tax base to a point where counties and other local units do not have the financial support to provide an adequate level of education for the children of Federal employees. Assistance is granted in areas first. where the revenues available to school districts from local sources have been reduced through the acquisition of real property by the Federal Government. second. where the local school districts are expected to provide education for children residing on Federal property. third. where the local districts provide education for children whose parents are employed by nontaxable Federal agencies. or fourth. where there has been a sudden and substantial increase in school attendance as the result of Federal activities. The first such assistance to local school districts was provided under the Lanham ActPublic Law 849in 1940. This. however. was limited in coverage. and administered by 12 different Federal agencies. The passage of Public Laws 874 and 815 in 1950 systematized the program. As amended. it continued until June 30 of this year. The Seattle area. a substantial part of which is in my congressional district. is heavily affected by Federal landownership and Federal activity. During the 10year period these laws have been in effect. the State of Washington has received more than $79 million. In 1960. 19.339 federally connected children enrolled in Seattles public schools. with parents working on or living on 86 pieces of federally owned property in the area. Although the Seattle public schools are obligated to provide educational facilities for these students. they are denied tax compensation except as provided under the program which just has expired. The average cost of educating a child in the Seattle public schools for last year was $387. The Public Law 874 entitlement receivedis the most frequent category. $90was only a small portion of that total cost. Under the same law. $776.000 was received for maintenance and operating cost for the 195960 school year. Seattle cannot afford to lose this assistance. Should the program lapse permanently. the burden would be unjustly heavy on the Seattle taxpayer and the impacted districts. many already with high bonded indebtedness. The State of Washington. with its many military installations and other Federal properties ranks fourth nationally in entitlement under Public Law 874. The Washington State Department of Public Instruction has estimated that during the 196162 school year. there will be 117.000 children enrolled in Washington public schools who would be covered .by Public Law 874. more than 84.000 will attend schools in the Puget Sound area. Unless prompt action is taken. many impacted school districts will have great difficulty in meeting their responsibilities toward increased enrollments. By the expiration of this program. the school districts of the State of Washington will forfeit $11.206.600 in revenue during the 196162 school year. The losses nationally would reach $312.088.000 for the same period. This would have to be made up by local taxpayers who can ill afford it. As early as February 2. 1961. a full 5 months before the expiration date of these laws. Louis Bruno. superintendent of public instruction for the State of Washington. wrote my office. noting: Budget time for the 196162 school year is fast approaching. and with school districts relying. in many cases. on a substantial percentage of their revenue from this Federal source. early action on this program is requested. On June 30. 1961. Public Law 874 and Public Law 815 expired. largely as the result of parliamentary maneuvering in an attempt to secure a more general program. How are school administrators to maintain anything approximating fiscal responsibility? Regardless of parliamentary intrigue. the local school districts are unable to shirk their responsibility for educating the youth of America. How can we possibly hope to meet the challenge facing American education. to forge new frontiers of learning. if Congress takes an irresponsible attitude toward the fiscal foundations of our academic institutions. The situation at the local level is critical. The Bellevue Public Schools. near Seattle. having received nearly $2 million under this program during the past 5 years. suddenly find this source of income abruptly stopped with only 1 month remaining before classes resume. In Auburn. in my district. two Federal agencies recently have been establishedthe FAA and the GSAbringing concomitant increases in student enrollment. I am informed that failure to receive Federal support to which the district would normally be entitled would be a crippling blow. Other Seventh District school systems adversely affected include Black Diamond. Enumclaw. Federal Way. Highline. Issaquah. Kent. Mercer Island. Renton. Snoqualmie Valley. South Central. Tahoma. and Vashon Island. Impacted areas legislation has been tied to the overall Federal aidtoeducation bills. At present. the general bill. H.R. 7300. is on the shelf in the Committee on Rules. If the general bill can be salvaged. then let it be brought to the floor. If not. then let us devise other methods to obtain the extension of the vital program of aid to impacted areas. so that the administrators of American public education may proceed with order to the tasks of education.\n'",wish call attention afternoon title provide extension expire year clamor passage general act federal aid school construction teacher salary lose_sight responsibility local school district program establish refer law provide federal assistance school district burden activity term impact area significant broad program envisage continuation program begin equal immediate importance other area recognize responsibility assist educational agency area impact federal activity impose serious financial burden financial impact cause concentration taxexempt installation lower tax base point county other local unit financial support provide adequate level education child federal employee assistance grant area revenue available school district local source reduce acquisition real property local school district expect provide education child reside federal property third local district provide education child parent employ nontaxable federal agency sudden substantial increase school attendance result federal activity first such assistance local school district provide limit coverage administer different federal agency passage systematize program amend continue year area substantial part congressional district affect federal landownership federal activity period law effect receive more connect child enrol public school parent work live piece own property area public school obligate provide educational facility student deny tax compensation provide program expire average cost educate child public school last year entitlement receivedi frequent category 90wa small portion total cost same law receive maintenance operating cost school year afford lose assistance program lapse burden heavy taxpayer impact district many high bond_indebtedness many military installation other property rank entitlement estimate school year child enrol public school cover more attend school area prompt action take many impact school district great difficulty meet responsibility increase enrollment expiration program school district forfeit revenue school year loss reach same period make local taxpayer afford full month expiration_date law superintendent public instruction write office note time school year fast_approaching school district rely many case substantial percentage revenue source early action program request public expire result parliamentary_maneuvering attempt secure general program school administrator maintain approximate fiscal responsibility parliamentary intrigue local school district unable shirk_responsibility educate youth hope meet challenge face american education forge new frontier learn take irresponsible attitude fiscal foundation academic institution situation local level critical have receive program past year find source income stop month remain class resume district federal agency concomitant increase student enrollment inform failure receive federal support district entitle crippling_blow other school system affect include enumclaw impact area legislation tie overall federal_aidtoeducation bill present general bill shelf general bill salvage let bring floor let devise other method obtain extension vital program aid impact area administrator american public education proceed order task education.\n,87.0,bound,0,1

It is impossible by delay to provide that the President. or any Department of the Government. shall place a person in charge of the Library building by appointment. This is a Congressional library. It is a library belonging to the two Houses of Congress. as the library always has belonged to the two Houses.

Instead of devolving these duties upon Mir. Green. I admit we may devolve them upon the Chief Engineer of the Army. or we can devolve them upon the Secretary of the Interior. or any other officer of the Government. Whatever may have been the past history of this question. I think it is important that this action should be taken. The reason for the haste is. that although there are contracts made. and numerous contracts. there are a great number of people who are working upon the Library building day by day and people who are receiving compensation by the day. and large comnensation is being paid for the decoration and ornamentation of the building. They have no authority to continue their work for a day or an hour unless we shall by some method devolve the control of the building upon some one.

The Democratic nominee says coal should play an important role in Americas energy future. He wants to ""forge new ways to draw cleaner power from coal."" But his record tells a different storyhis votes and policies are aggressively anticoal. On every issue of importance to coal and coal miners. he has sided with environmental extremists. who. like the Democratic nominee. view coal as a ""dirty energy source"" that must be eradicated. Last year. the Democratic nominee voted for the Climate Stewardship Act. S. 139. a bill very similar to the Kyoto Protocol. which would destroy the coal industry. Unions for Jobs and the Environment. a group that includes the United Mine Workers. called S. 139 ""a bad idea."" and believe that- passage of S. 139 ""would be tantamount to a~loption of the Kyoto Protocol."" According to the Energy Information Administration. the bill causes steep declines in coal use and production and eliminates thousands of coal jobs. S. 139 would: cut coalfired electricity by 80 percent. cut bituminous coal production by 69 percent. destroy 56.000 coal industry jobs. and cause existing coal plants in West Virginia. Ohio. Michigan. and Pennsylvania to shut down. ""In the S.139 case. a large proportion of existing coal capacity is projected to be retired. It is simply not economical to continue operating these plants."" Along with running mate JOHN EDWARDS. the. Democratic nominee is a cosponsor of the Clean Power Act. This legislation would impose heavy burdens on coal. forcing many plants to switch to natural gas or shut down. This bill is so hostile to coal that the Ohio legislature. by an overwhelming bipartisan margin. passed a resolution condemning it. The resolution states: The carbon dioxide emissions cap in the bill needlessly eliminates a significant component of electric generation in the United States by effectively removing coal as a fuel source. The bill will cause electric utilities to switch from coal to natural gas because the electric utilities would no longer have the option to economically generate. electricity from coal... The United Mine Workers. the Utility Workers. the Boilermakers. and other labor unions oppose the bill. In testimony before the committee I chair. the Environment and Public Works Committee. Eugene Trisko of the United Mine Workers stated: The union is strongly opposed to efforts to use the Clean Air Act as a vehicle for regulating greenhouse gas emissions . . . Limits on carbon emissions would require switching from coal to natural gas or other highercost energy sources. with potentially devastating impacts on the economies of coalproducing states. Further. according to independent analysis. the bill: cuts coalfired electric generation by 55 percent and coal production by 50 percent. EIA analysis of the Clean Power Act. destroys 32.000 coal jobs. and forces many coalfired power plants to shut down. ""resulting in substantial economic impacts."" The Democratic nominee has routinely criticized President Bush for rejecting Kyoto. As he said last year. ""Instead of renegotiating the Kyoto Treaty to improve it. he simply repudiated it."" And the Vice Presidential nominee. when asked in February by the San Francisco Chronicle whether he would support- Kyoto. responded with a direct. ""Yes."" and said his running mate agreed with him. The Democratic nominee says the U.S. should ""reengage with the international. community"" to forge a new global warming agreement. but the question remains: What would the agreement look like? And how could any agreement calling for strict reductions in C02 emissions not harm coal? Now they say they oppose Kyoto. describing its timetables and mandates as -""infeasible."" ""The Democratic nominees believe that the Kyoto Protocol is not the answer. The nearterm emission reductions it would iequire of the United States are infeasible. while the longterm obligations imposed on all nations are too little to solve the problem."" But the Democratic nominees environmental group supporters know where he stands on Kyoto. ""We dont have doubts that this issue is at the top of his todo list when elected. or his redo list."" said Betsy Loyless of the League of Conservation Voters. which endorsed him for president. Saying. ""there is no doubt in our mind that he will reengage in Kyoto."" Further. the Democratic nominee tried to save Kyoto in 2000 during negotiations with the EU. Quoting from a UPI article at the time: Instead. one senator who accompanied him to Vietnam. John Kerry (DMA). entered the fray. Senator Kerry. an aggressive promoter of the United States. was ubiquitously huddled over notepads and scribbling aides.. attempting to develop U.S. offers on certain mechanisms that its counterparts would accept. Not only did he utry to save Kyoto. but he opposed efforts -by the Clinton administration to ease U.S. compliance with the treaty. According to an AP article: U.S. Sen. John Kerry. a Massachusetts Democrat who has been involved in environmental legislation. said he also had problems with the U.S. position. Instead of cutting its emissions by 7 percent as agreed at Kyoto. he said. the sinks proposal would allow the United States to pump at least 1 percent more greenhouse gases than it did in 1990. ""Some sinks clearly must be counted. but they should be in line with the spirit of the Kyoto agreement."" he said. ""Any retrenchment diminishes our credibility on other proposals"" and raises ""understandable suspicion that they are mere loopholes."" According to a Grist Magazine article this year: The Democratic nominee .is no casual Kyoto detractorhe has attended a number of Kyoto conferences over the years and tridd to push negotiations forward. and he has a long record of consistently _voting in favor of policy measures to curb global warming. from stricter CAFE standards to mandatory greenhousegas regulations. I want everyone to understand. Kyoto would eliminate coal use. ""Under the Kyoto Protocol. coal consumption would be phased out over the period 2010 to 2020. The result would be *massive dislocations in coal producing areas. Kyoto would eliminate nearly 50.000 jobs in Ohio. 40.000 jobs in Pennsylvania. and 22.000 jobs in Michigan. Kyoto would be disastrous for West Virginia coal. According to a study by West Virginia University. Kyoto would cause a 25.5 percent decline in coal mining. destroy 42.800 jobs. reduce state GDP by over $3 billion. and reduce per capita income by $393. The West Virginia and Ohio legislatures passed resolutions rejecting Kyoto and preventing State agencies from implementing any part of the treaty. IAccording to his website. the Democratic nominee says he will spend $10 billion over the next decade on clean coal technologies. But as the above demonstrates. you cant have clean coal without coal. Moreover. his policies would obstruct installation of clean coal technologies. placing further burdens on the industry in meeting new Clean Air Act requirements. The Democratic nominee opposes President Bushs New Source Review reforms that allow utilities to upgrade their facilities with clean. energy efficient technologies. avoiding the complex. burdensome. and environmentally counterproductive permitting process unleashed by the ClintonEPA.. He supports lawsuits filed by environmental groups now blocking President Bushs NSR reforms: He even joined in the junior Senator from New Yorks antiNSR reform legal brief. He voted last year for his running mates amendment to delay President Bushs reforms and vows to ""immediately reverse the. BushCheney rollbacks of the Nations Clean Air Program."" Most critically. returning to the Clinton NSR program would thwart installation of clean coal technologies. According to the National Coal Council. uncertainty over the Clinton NSR policy ""has had a direct and chilling effect on all maintenance and efficiency improvements and clean coal technology installations at existing power plants."" The Democratic nominee also missed the vote on last years. energy bill. and later said that had he been present. he would have voted against it. Yet the bill included several provisions and substantial funding for clean coal technologies: Authorizes $200 million annually for fiscal years. 2004 through 2012 for clean coal research and coalbased gasification technologies. authorizes funding to the Secretary of Energy for loans. and authorizes the Secretary to make loan guarantees for a variety of clean coal projects around the country. directs the Secretary of Energy to carry out a program to facilitate production and generation of coalbased power and the installation of pollutioncontrol equipment. and creates an investment tax credit for facilities retrofitted. repowered or replaced with clean coal technology. ""Where we see a beautiful mountaintop. George Bush sees a strip mine."" This is the Democratic nominees view of mountaintop mining. which employs 15.000 people and provides $21.8 million in revenue for education in West Virginia. according to a study by Marshall University. In 1999. he voted against the senior Senator from West Virginias amendment to overturn a Federal court decision that threatened to end mountaintop mining in West Virginia. According to the senior Senator from West Virginia said the goal of his amendment was ""to allow for the con.itinuation of our coal industry and the jobs it provides while better protecting the mountains and hollows of the state we love."" I would point out that the United Mine Workers of America strongly supported the amendment. He even joined forces with then Vice President Al Gore. who. after initially supporting the amendment. threatened to veto any appropriations bill that included it. A recent Federal court decision. issued by U.S. District Judge Joseph Goodwin a Clinton appointee. halted 11 mountaintop mining projects in southern West Virginia. The economic impacts. according to West Virginia economists. could be devastating. The question is: where does the Democratic nominee stand on this decision? Economist Michael Hicks and Cal Kent. former dean of Marshall Universitys business college. said the ruling could slow the permitting process for mountaintop mining by 2 years. resulting in a 40 percent decline in coal production. ""That decline the economists predicted. could lead to layoffs. stunted investment in West Virginiaparticularly in the southern Coalfields regionand less revenue for the state. And the impact could. be felt as soon as this fiscal year."" they said. The Democratic nominee has a unique view of the Clean Air Act. According to him. when the act was passed in 1970. there was a consensus that existing coalfired power plants had a remaining lifespan of 10 to 15 years. Beyond that time. according to this view. they would be forced to install costly new pollution controls or simply shut down. Nearly ""46 percent of coalfired capacity in Ohio was built before 1970. In West Virginia. nearly onethird of capacity was built prior to 1970. Additionally. over 75 percent of coalfired capacity in Ohio and West Virginia was built between 1970 and 1974. According to the Democratic nominee. these plants must install exorbitantly expensive pollution controls. which would force many plants to close. or simply shut down altogether. causing massive economic dislocations. job losses. and higher energy costs in Ohio and West Virginia. According to the NSR legal brief. which the Democratic nominee joined. the Clean Air Act ""created a limited and qualified grace period within which existing plants could continue to operate. Accordingly. the 1970 CAA set up a simple choice for existing sources: either upgrade to new source standards or shut down."" In conclusion. KerryEdwards is the most anticoal presidential ticket in American history. Yes. evenI worse than ClintonGore.

I commend the Presiding Officer for those actions and look forward to working with you on a variety of projects.

Senator Kaufman. who had been a longtime employee of the Senate. came to this floor on a fairly regular basis during his time here to basically celebrate and acknowledgein most casesthe tireless. unsung work of so many of our Federal employees. As we debate budgets. debt. and deficit. we oftentimes recognize we have to make extraordinary and difficult choices in cuts. In many instances. behind all of those cuts are Federal employees who do remarkable work in keeping us safe. providing services. and helping our country grow. Ted Kaufman used to come down here on a regular basis and celebrate some of those unsung heroes. I was proud to continue his tradition during the last Congress and look forward to carrying it on through another session. I start this next Congress actually celebrating two great Federal employees. I might add. who both happen to be Virginians who serve as excellent role models. They represent the thousands of professionals who work quietly every day across our intelligence community to keep our Nation safe. Very often these professionals work in anonymity and many risk their lives in troubled spots far away from the limelight. and that is how it should be. Recently we have seen certain incidents abroad. and sometimes they pay with the highest sign of sacrifice in terms of their lives.

H.R. 2239. taking his great intelligence and experience as a physicist and wedding it to his legislative experience here in the Congress and trying to help our Nation improve on the voting systems that we have. but to do so in a way that every voter will be confident that when they cast their ballot that their vote is really in there. in that machine. In fact. I begin with that statement because one of the leading election officials in my own district said to me. Congresswoman. I do not have confidence that in what is being done right now that I can answer to the citizens of this county that their vote will be in there. How do they know its in there? Give me the confidence that I know its in there. I said. I am supporting Congressman HOLTs bill so that we get an auditable paper trail at every precinct. I would say that in addition to being a U.S. Representative. which I was elected to rather later in life. the very first office I was ever elected to and still hold is precinct committeewoman in my own home precinct. Ohio is unlike some of the other States in the Union. but we value every vote at the precinct level. We count the votes at the precinct level. Under Ohio law when you cast your vote and there is a paper trail currently in every precinct in our county. over 500 of these precincts. the votes in that precinct are counted right there. They are not taken to another location. Both Democrats and Republicans count these votes together. and there are actual documents that they have to handle. physically handle and then tally and then those votes are both sent to the board of elections in a central location. but also posted on the door outside that precinct. Any voter can go and take that tally at the end of the day. We have a very transparent system. one in which our major parties have confidence. Every tally that is done in the voting logs that are assembled in every precinct. they are added up. Sometimes mistakes are made in the precincts in terms of the tallies but then those are caught at the central board of elections. and we try to really assure that the count is as fair as possible. If it is not. if people have any concern. if there is a onevote margin in an election. you can go back to the paper trail and you can go back and see what was done in every single precinct in the county. I wanted to say to the gentleman. I think that this verification is so extraordinarily important. What happened in Florida at the moment could not happen in Ohio because in Florida they move their ballots to a counting station. They do not count in every precinct. Speaking as a Buckeye. speaking as an Ohioan. I do not want our rights taken away from us at the precinct level. I also would. if the gentleman will allow me. wish to place in the RECORD this evening for every election official in this country. at every county in the country. at every precinct. at every board of election. I have found great confusion as to what the Help America Vote Act actually requires and the Federal Election Commission on its Web site has what is required by the Federal law. every single year. And indeed it is not until January 1. 2006. that every State and jurisdiction is required to comply with the voting systems requirements of the Help America Vote Act that we passed last year. Some people are under the impression that they have to have everything done by next year. They do not. They can get a waiver that they have to file with the Federal Election Commission this coming January. The seeretaries of state of our country should have notified counties of this. But I can tell you. as I go out into my Ohio counties. the local boards of election simply do not know this. There is great concern and there is great consternation. I will place this in the RECORD. I would also like to say to the gentlernan from New Jersey. in addition to his bill which I hope we can pass expeditiously. I would urge our State legislatures to adopt nofault absentee voting. that if there is any concern next year at any precinct or a doubt about the integrity of that machine. that voters- can have an alternate way of casting a vote In that county through nofault absentee voting or indeed even paper ballots at the same precincts. so that people have confidence that their vote will be counted.\n',want thank gentleman extraordinary leadership important piece legislation introduce take great intelligence experience physicist wed legislative experience try help nation improve voting system way voter confident cast_ballot vote machine fact begin statement lead election official own district say congresswoman confidence do answer citizen county vote know give confidence know say support holt bill get auditable paper trail precinct say addition elect life first office elect hold precinct_committeewoman own home precinct other value vote precinct level count vote precinct level law cast vote paper trail precinct county precinct vote precinct count take location count vote actual document handle handle vote send board election central location post door precinct voter go take tally end day transparent system major party confidence tally do voting log assemble precinct add mistake make precinct term tally catch central board election try assure count fair possible people concern onevote_margin election go paper trail go see do single precinct county want say gentleman think verification important happen moment happen move ballot counting station count precinct speak speak want right take precinct level gentleman allow wish place record evening election official country county country precinct board election find great confusion require web_site require law single year jurisdiction require comply voting system requirement pass last year people impression do next year get waiver file come seeretarie state country notify county tell go county local board election know great concern great consternation place record like say gentlernan addition bill hope pass urge legislature adopt nofault absentee_voting concern next year precinct doubt integrity machine voters- alternate way cast vote county nofault absentee_voting paper ballot same precinct people confidence vote,108.0,daily,0,1

R. 4051. as reported by the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce. is the result of most careful consideration by that committee. It is clear recognition of the responsibility of the Federal Government in promoting the creation of new scientific knowledge and the development of scientific talent among the young men and women of the Nation. The necessity for favorable action may be found in the committee report where it is stated that ""the committee Is of the opinion that legislation of this character is essential to the preservation and fogtering of the national health. security. and prosperity. and to the full development of our scientific resources."" Other members of the committee will discuss fully the form of organization and its powers and duties. As the sponsor of subsection 4 (b). and for the purpose of emphasizing the fundamental reason for that provision. I wish to comment on it briefly. Subsection 4 (b) is as follows: In exercising the authority and discharging the functions referred to in subsection (a) of this section. It shall be one of the objectives of the Foundation to strengthen funcamental research and education in the sciencas. including independent research by individuals. throughout the United States. and to avoid undue concentration of such research and education. Those who are familiar with the history of this legislation in the present session of Congress will recall that as the companion bill was reported in the other body. no formula for geographical distribution of any portion of the funds to be appropriated was recommended. but that during consideration of the bill an amendment was adopted providing for such a formula. We must recognize the fact that fundamental scientific research became highly concentrated during the war because of practical necessities. The policies of many of the large philanthropic foundations and of Government agencies have been such as to Indicate a very real possibility that this concentration might continue in peacetime. Resulting from this concentration. there is the obvious danger of withdrawing the best teachers and graduate students from the smaller and newer institutions to the older and lar:er institutions with fortunate financial standing. Moreover. anyone concerned with securing immediate results of research frequently finds a better opportunity for such results by devoting funds to projects assigned to established research institutions or laboratories. Il. is my understanding that during the war approximately 90 percent of the funds spent under university contracts by the OSRD were allotted to five institutions. While this was demonstrated to be a sound decision. it also contained elements of risk from a security point of view which had to be taken and which should not be perpetuated. Consequently. we are now faced squarely with the extremely difficult problem of building up more research centers throughout the United States. This poses the question of whether that can be best accomplished through a formula requiring automatic distribution of a portion of the funds geographically or by leaving the matter for the decision of the Foundation. with the clearly expressed congressional intention and mandate contained in subsection 4 (b) that one of the main objectives of the Foundation in carrying out its program shall be the constant strengthening of fundamental research and education in the sciences throughout the country. To carry out that congressional intention and to discharge that mandate. a particular effort must be made by the Foundation to encourage and develop sound projects In regions wh:ich are not today recognized centers of such research. And to accomplish thE objective. the Foundation must also make a determined effort to locate qualified persons in each of the States. Territories. possessions. and the District of Columbia for the award of scholarships and fellowships under the provisions of section 10. Obviously. the recital of a policy is no guarantee that the congressional intention will be realized. It is an unforturate. historical fact that many agencies of the Government have devoted themselves to efforts to evade statements of congressional intention. But the method of selection of the members of the Foundation provided in this resolution offers assurance that the powers and duties of the Foundation will be exercised with a determination to carry out the expressed congressional intention. Moreover. the program lends itself to the clearest kind of proof that the intention has been carried out because annually the Foundation will make a report summarizing its activities. This will demonstrate both as to amounts of money and location of activities and individuals the success of the program in achieving the objective stated in subsection 4 (b). Failure to carry out the congressional intention will result in a justifiable demand that some method. such as the formula of a fixed geographical distribution. be adopted. But. In the creation of the Foundation. It seems to me to be a better approach to the problem to state the congressional intention in plain. unmistakable language and to rely upon the Foundation to realize the objective rather than to attempt a solution through the arbitrary allocation of a fixed percentage of available funds. Certainly the latter course would have the effect of limiting the Foundation In exercising the powers and discharging the duties set forth in subsection 4 (a). Too. it could result in creating a system of pressures arising from desires to participate in program without reliance primarily upon meeting the criteria and standards which must be established by the Foundation. As the resolution has been reported by the committee. with this emphasis upon a clear congressional intention. the opportunity is given to every educational institution. to every qualified research organization. to every individual engaged in Independent research. and to every qualified scientific student or scholar to participate. And it will be a simple matter for the Congress and the country to measure the success of the Foundations effort to realize the objective stated in subsection 4 (b) year by year. Therefore. I hope that this subsection will meet with approval. will remain in the resolution. as adopted. and will be retained in the final version in conference. And I urge that any effort to establish a fixed formula be rejected.\n'",report result careful consideration committee clear recognition responsibility promote creation new scientific knowledge development scientific talent young man woman nation necessity favorable action find committee report state committee opinion legislation character essential preservation fogtering national health security prosperity full development scientific resource other member committee discuss form organization power duty sponsor subsection_b purpose emphasize fundamental reason provision wish comment subsection_b follow exercise authority discharge function refer subsection a section objective strengthen funcamental research education scienca include independent research individual avoid undue_concentration such research education familiar history legislation present session recall companion bill report other body formula geographical_distribution portion fund appropriate recommend consideration bill amendment adopt provide formula recognize fact fundamental scientific research become concentrated war practical necessity policy many large philanthropic foundation government agency such indicate real possibility concentration continue peacetime result concentration obvious danger withdraw good teacher graduate student small new institution old lar institution fortunate financial standing concern secure immediate result research find well opportunity such result devote fund project assign establish research institution laboratory understanding war percent fund spend university contract osrd allot institution demonstrate sound decision contain element risk security point view take perpetuate face difficult problem build more research center pose question accomplish formula require automatic distribution portion fund leave matter decision express congressional intention mandate contain subsection_b main objective carry program constant strengthening fundamental research education science country carry congressional intention discharge mandate particular effort make encourage develop sound project region ich today recognize center such research accomplish objective make determined effort locate qualified person territory possession award scholarship_fellowship provision section recital policy guarantee congressional intention realize unforturate historical fact many agency devote effort evade statement congressional intention method selection member provide resolution offer assurance power duty exercise determination carry express congressional intention program lend clear kind proof intention carry make report summarize activity demonstrate amount money location activity individual success program achieve objective state subsection_b failure carry congressional intention result justifiable demand method such formula fix geographical_distribution adopt creation seem well approach problem state congressional intention plain_unmistakable language rely realize objective attempt solution arbitrary allocation fix percentage available fund latter course effect limit exercise power discharge duty set subsection result create system pressure arise desire participate program reliance meet criterion standard establish resolution report committee emphasis clear congressional intention opportunity give educational institution qualified research organization individual engage independent research qualified scientific student scholar participate simple matter country measure success effort realize objective state subsection_b year year hope subsection meet approval remain resolution adopt retain final version conference urge effort establish fix formula rejected.\n,80.0,bound,1,0

I shall have to hurry through. and cannot take as much time as I had intended to take to discuss the subject. However. let me briefly summarize the other principal objections which have been made to the measure. The measure is not adverse to the interests of the producers of sugar in Hawaii and Puerto Rico. I say it is not adverse because every sponsor of the measure agreed over his own signature. and agreed with the chairman of the Committee on Finance. that the slight arithmetical error which was made in the computation of the allocations to Hawaii and Puerto Rico would be corrected. We are quite willing to make the correction in order that there shall be no reduction in the production of raw sugar in Hawaii and Puerto Rico. It should be called to the attention of the Senate and of the public that in the Sugar Act of 1937 it was provided that 55.59 percent would be the quota for domestic sugarproducing areas and 44.41 to foreign countries. The provision is that ""whenever a determination is made pursuant to section 201."" which is the section which prescribes the formula by which the consumption requirement shall be found. the amount of sugar needed to meet the requirements of consumers. the Secretary shall establish quotas or revise existing quotas for the domestic sugarproducing areas of 55.59 percent. and for foreign countries and the Commonwealth of the Philippines 44.41 percent. The amendment which we proposed. and which passed the Senate. had the effect of increasing the proportion for domestic producers from 55.59 percent to 60 percent and decreasing the proportion for foreign countries. including the Commonwealth of the Philippine Islands. from 44.41 to 40 percent. Even here there was not a proposal to grant unlimited expansion to the domestic producing industry. but only the provision that a certain addition should be made sufficient to allow vitally necessary expansion in the United States. If there were any errors in the formula there. the sponsors of the bill were then ready. and stand ready now. to make such alterations as may be necessary. It was not a real violation of the international treaty. It may have been a technical violation. but the difference in the allocation to foreign countries provided for in the bill passed by the Senate and the allocation under the old bill was only twentytwo onethousandths of 1 percentcertainly not a figure that would require very much labor and energy to amend. As for the provision with regard to Louisiana. the only effect of that was that it would prevent the plowing up of planted sugarcane. and I doubt very much whether there is any Member of the House or the Senate who will say that sugarcane once planted should be plowed up and that the producer should not be permitted to dispose of it to advantage. There remains only one subject for me to discuss in the time that is available to me. and that has to do with the urgent need for expansion. particularly in the beetproducing areas. oPPOarTrIEs cITED Early in January I addressed a letter to the Bureau of Reclamation asking for a statement with respect to the areas in the West now under reclamation which need but cannot receive an allocation for the planting of sugar beets.

I rise in support of H.R. 15499. the Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act of 1976. The importance of this legislation is underscored by the fact that onethird of the Federal budget is spent through outlays on either procurement contractssome $70 billion. or grantssome $65 billion. This legislation would implement two key recommendations made by the Commission on Government Procurement resulting from our 21/2year study. First. it provides uniform guidelines to distinguish and control the use of grants. procurement contracts. and cooperative agreements by Federal agencies based on the fundamental purpose of the transaction and what kind of relationship is expected between the Government and a recipient. Second. it mandates a study that should lead to the development of a comprehensive system of guidance for Federal assistance programs. I might add that the Paperwork Commission has recently endorsed this legislation and supports the clarification of Federal recipient relationships through a standardization of legal instruments as one way of changing the causes of the redtape paperwork problem. The approach adopted in this legislation would clarify Federal relationships through the standardization of legal instruments rather than through organizational administrative coordination and fiscal relationships. In addition. there is increasing evidence that a primary cause of excessive redtape and paperwork problems is the growth of large numbers of uncoordinated Federal assistance programs. This legislation would help to structure and organize management in Federal assistance programs thereby improving management techniques so that paperwork can be reduced. In addition. section 7(b) of the bill will preserve the authority to vest property in certain performers currently contained in 42 United States Code 1892 which is being specifically repealed by the bill. It is not intended to restrict the authority of the agencies to vest title in property acquired under contracts. grants. or cooperative agreements with nonFederal participants where such participants substantially share in the cost of the work.

Lilienthal announced the rates in September 1933. without consulting the other two members of the Board. At that time he stated that the rates included all costs. when. as a matter of fact. the allocation of costs were not made for many months thereafter. In fact. the first cost allocation was made in 1938. After Lilienthal had made his first announcement of the yardstick rates. he stated that the same were ""a little more than a lucky guess."" When the final allocation of costs was made to the President in June 1938 by the Financial Political Committee of the T. V. A.. appointed to make an allocation of costs. this committee says: Every method of allocating the common plant investment necessary involves assumption and estimates. the formulation of which is dependent upon the widely varying opinions of individuals. * * * The problem is one of judgment rather than scientific calculation. The committees conclusions are. therefore. in the form of a recommended policy based on judgment and not on any one allocation theory. I have repeatedly stated that the T. V. A. yardstick is a fake. It is worse than a fakeit is a willful fraud put forth to deceive. A yardstick should be a thing of accuracy. Its virtue is its accuracy. A yardstick is not a slide rule. A yardstick should be the same to all people at all times. It is a standard. A slide rule is a rule by which computations are made when different factors are considered. The only practical way by which the T. V. A. rates can be considered as a yardstick would be for the T. V. A. to compute honestly every element in the cost of production and then fix the price at the dams. or. more technically speaking. at the bus bars. This is the system employed at Boulder Dam. But so long as the T. V. A. contracts to retail power and assumes to transmit power on its own private transmission facilities. and to engage in promotional programs and private salesmanship programs. and to engage in municipal elections and all other local activities. it will be impossible for it to fix a yardstick. Here are some of the reasons why T. V. A. rates cannot be accepted as an honest yardstick: First. The cost of production cannot be computed accurately because the dams are built with Government money. With the benefit that the Government gets from mass construction and with the benefit that the Government gets from unlimited credit. it would not be fair to private industry if this were not computed. The Government can buy practically every item used in the construction of its dams cheaper than private industry can buy it. Second. No interest is computed. for the Government is not required to go to the bank and arrange for credit as a private individual would be required to do. Third. The Government pays no taxes of any kind. A private individual would be required to pay countless kinds of taxes in the construction of the dam. It would have to provide itself with insurance of all kinds to protect its property and its workingmen. It would have to provide itself with franchises and licenses of various kinds and bonds of all kinds and descriptions. It would be required to pay taxes on its improvement. and this tax would be State. local. and Federal. Fourth. The Government would have the benefit of free legal talent. free postage. and free communication of various kinds. Fifth. The Government would also have the advantage in that it could arrange its allocation figures between navigation. flood control. and power as it might see fit. If the Government is to be allowed all these advantages and not reflect the same in its yardstick. then. of course. its yardstick would be less than a 20inch yardstick.\n'",build year announce rate consult other member time state rate include cost matter fact allocation cost make many month fact first cost allocation make make first announcement yardstick rate state same little more lucky guess final allocation cost make appoint make allocation cost committee say method allocate common plant investment necessary involve assumption estimate formulation dependent vary opinion individual problem judgment scientific calculation committee conclusion form recommend policy base judgment allocation theory state a. yardstick fake bad fakeit willful fraud put deceive yardstick thing accuracy virtue accuracy yardstick slide rule yardstick same people time standard slide rule rule computation make different factor consider only practical way a. rate consider yardstick a. compute element cost production fix price dam speak bus bar system employ a. contract retail power assume transmit power own private transmission facility engage promotional program private salesmanship program engage municipal election other local activity impossible fix yardstick reason a. rate accept honest yardstick cost production compute dam build money benefit get mass construction benefit get unlimited credit fair private industry compute buy item use construction dam cheap private industry buy interest compute require go bank arrange credit private individual require pay taxis kind private individual require pay countless kind taxis construction dam provide insurance kind protect property workingman provide franchise license various kind bond kind description require pay taxis improvement tax local benefit free legal talent free postage free communication various kind advantage arrange allocation figure navigation flood control power see_fit government allow advantage reflect same yardstick course yardstick less yardstick.\n,76.0,bound,1,0

I think the amendment of my colleague from Illinois - proceeds rather from the heart than- from his level head. What is the proposition? That all postal cars. shall be of steel frame by 1916. One would think that the invention of the steel car had originated with Congress or was now being proceeded with because of congressional action. The railroads of the country are constructing steel cars as fast as they can be turned out. and it is not possible. with any facilities- which: now exist or which are likely to exist before 1916.. to furnish coaches and cars of steel frame. What. then. would be the proposition?- That no wooden postal car- could be. used in a train of wooden cars. that you must have a. steel postal car. in. a. train that is not composed of steel coaches.. and yet gentlemen. here are very much exercised for fear they will use: a wooden postal car in with. a steel coach. If it be dangerous to do that. it is equally dangerous to do the other thing. These two things have to move hand in hand. The railroad. companies fully understand that they have got to reconstruct their ideas in reference to cars--postal cars. sleepiug cars. and coachesand. that the steel- car has come to stay. They have just constructed. a great factory in my district for the purpose of manufacturing steel cars. They are turning out steel cars as rapidly is- can be. done. and while other industries have been depressed throughout the country. the Pullman Works have been working overtime making these steel cars and other cars. I would be glad to see every car used a steel car. but you can- not force... and ought not to force. steel postal cars on ahead of steel coaches and steel sleeping cars.

The stark reality is that the trade reciprocity bill to which the Kasten amendment is attached will not be taken up in the House of Representatives. It is also a reality that the Committee of Jurisdiction. Ways and Means. is opposed to the repeal effort. There appears to be no consensus on that committee for any specific action. Some members want straight repeal. Some members want repeal with new taxes on banks. And some members want to pass the Senate compromise language. The fact remains that we are running out of time.

950304696,S,19780717,344,Mr. CULVER,Unknown,CULVER,Unknown,M,7763,8252,07171978.txt,17425,1072,95103191,CULVER,JOHN,S,IA,M,D,,voting,While the committee found in its hearings that much controversy still surrounds the Tellico Dam case. the case is the type of Federal action which should be eligible for review by the Endangered Species Committee established by this bill and given appropriate consideration for an exemption under the new review process mandated in this legislation. Testimony received by the committee indicates that a substantial number of Federal actions currently underway appear to have all the elements of an irresolvable conflict within the provisions of the act. This number may increase significantly in the future as the Fish and Wildlife Service continues to list additional species and critical habitats. As I mentioned. some flexibility is needed in the act to allow consideration of those cases where a Federal action cannot be completed or its objectives cannot be met without directly conflicting with the requirements of section 7. The bill requires that when conflicts with the Endangered Species Act are known or shown or should be known. an agency must consult immediately with the Fish and Wildlife Service and exhaust all reasonable avenues for eliminating the conflict. If this consultation process is unsuccessful in resolving the conflict. the bill provides a further review process in section 7(e) to address the conflict and resolve it. The bill sets up a sevenmember Endangered Species Committee composed of the Secretary of the Interior. the Secretary of Agriculture. the Secretary of the Army. the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. the Chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality. and the Governor of the State in which the action is located. The Marine Mammal Protection Act gives responsibility for protecting certain endangered and threatened species to the Secretary of Commerce. For cases in which the conflict before the Endangered Species Committee involves such a species. the Secretary of Commerce is required to concur with the Secretary of the Interior before that vote is cast. The bill was amended by the committee to add the Governor of the State affected by the proposed action as a voting member of the Endangered Species Committee. The purpose of this addition was twofold. First. it was considered important that an elected official be a member of the Endangered Species Committee. Second. there was a perceived need to have someone on the Endangered Species Committee who is in touch with and understands the needs and desires of those persons close to or dependent on the Federal activities which would be the subject of the exemption application. The State Governor met both of these requirements. If a case should occur in which more than one State is affected by the proposed action and legitimately involved in the outcome of the review process. all appropriate Governors may take part in the Endangered Species Committee work and discussions. For purposes of the decision regarding an exemption. however. the several States shall have collectively only one vote. The Governors will therefore determine among themselves how the single State vote should be cast. The Endangered Species Committee can carry on business only when all seven members or their designated representatives are present. In order to grant such an exemption at least five of the seven members must agree that the criteria listed in subsection (e) of this section are met. and vote in favor of such an exemption. A member may not delegate his or her vote to any other person. in the event one of the members is unable to be present at the time a vote is taken. he or she must transmit the vote in writing to the chairman of the Endangered Species Committee. When an agency believes it has encountered an irresolvable conflict with the act which cannot be resolved through consultation with the Fish and Wildlife Service or the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS). that agency may petition the Endangered Species Committee for relief. The Fish and Wildlife Serviceor when appropriate the Fish and Wildlife Service in consultation with the National Marine Fisheries Servicewould have 30 days to respond to the agencys petition and give its views as to whether the consultation process required by section 7 had been fully conducted. After reviewing the response of the Fish and Wildlife Service and other relevant information. the Endangered Species Committee would decide whether or not the action should be considered for an exemption. No action could be so considered unless the Endangered Species Committee determined: First. that the requirements of the section 7 consultation process had been met. second. that there had been a reasonable and responsible effort to resolve the conflicts and that the Federal agency requesting the exemption has made. subsequent to the initiation of consultation no irreversible or irretrievable commitment of resources which forecloses the consideration of modifications or alternatives to the action. and third. that an irresolvable conflict does indeed exist. If the Endangered Species Committee makes positive determinations on each of these matters it would then conduct hearings and receive public testimony on whether an exemption is warranted. Within 180 days after the Endangered July M. 1978 Species Committee first received the agencys petition and the Fish and Wildlife Services response. the Endangered Species Committee must publish in the Federal Register its decision as to whether the action should be exempted. modified. or terminated. No project could be exempted. or exempted with modifications unless the Endangered Species Committee determines that there is no reasonable and prudent alternative to such action. that it is of regional or national significance. and that its benefits clearly outweigh the benefits of alternative courses of action that are consistent with conserving the species or its critical habitat. and that the action is in the public interest. In reviewing available alternatives to the action under review. the committee would be charged to examine the benefits of all available alternatives. not simply those which are within the agencys jurisdiction or are consistent with the original project objectives. After deciding that some additional discretion to resolve conflicts was a necessary addition to the present provision of the Endangered Species Act. the committee considered a number of options on how to introduce this discretionary authority into the present law. Of these options an Endangered Species Committee was chosen as that one best suited to make the necessary balancing decisions regarding conflicts. This committee concept was employed because it seemed to offer the involvement of the broadest array of expertise and the greatest potential for a balancing of viewpoints concerning all the alternatives to be considered. The committee hearings indicated that the requirements of section 7 might also conflict with a number of administrative processes. for example. Federal licensing and permitting of private activities. If a Federal agency. in carrying out an administrative function of this type determines. after appropriate consultation with FWS or the National Marine Fisheries Service. that a conflict with the act is irresolvable. the agency can petition for an exemption under the provisions of section 7(e). This approach provides relief for both the party who applied for the license or permit and for the Federal agency who might. except for the requirements of the Endangered Species Act. be disposed to approve the license or permit request. This is a reasonable policy for responding to this type of Federal action which might occur on private or Federal lands. The basic premise of S. 2899 is that the integrity of the interagency consultation process designated under section 7 of the act be preserved. Many. if not most. conflicts between the Endangered Species Act and Federal actions can be resolved by full and good faith consultation between the project agency and FWS or NMFS. as appropriate. Only in those instances where the consultation process has been exhausted and a conflict still exists should the Endangered Species Committee consider granting an exemption for a Federal action. In order to assure this intent. S. 2899 sets up a twostep process by which Federal projects can be considered for an exemption. In the first step. the Endangered Species Committee must decide if the application is ripe for review. Specifically. it would have to find first that the requirements of the consultation process described in section 7(a) had been met. These requirements are specifically set forth in regulations promulgated by FWS and NMFS in CFR 50. chapter IV. part 402. Second. the Endangered Species Committee must determine that a reasonable and responsible effort had been made by both parties to resolve the conflict once it is known to exist and that. subsequent to the initiation of consultation. the construction agency had made no irreversible or irretrievable commitment to resources which forecloses the consideration of those modificatiois or alternatives to such action which are consistent with preserving the species or its critical habitat. Under the current section 7 regulations. Federal agencies have a responsibility to identify activities or programs which they undertake that may affect listed species or their critical habitat and to request consultation with the services concerning those activities or programs. Thus. the consultation process must be initiated at that point in the implementation of the action where the Federal agency first recognizes that the activity may have a detrimental effect on a species or its critical habitat. Finally. in the process of deciding whether to review fully an action for an exemption the Endangered Species Committee would be required to determine that an irresolvable conflict does indeed exist. The term irresolvable conflict is defined as an action authorized. funded or carried out by a Federal agency where. after consultation as required in section 7. completion of such action would jeopardize the continued existence of an endangered or threatened species or result in the adverse modification or destruction of its critical habitat. An irresolvable conflict cannot be found to exist unless the project agency had thoroughly reviewed all modifications and alternatives to the action that are within its jurisdiction and consistent with the objectives of the project. but has determined that even with the adoption of such modifications or alternatives the activity cannot be completed without adversely affecting a listed species or critical habitat. CRITERIA If the Endangered Species Committee determines that the initial criteria for review have been met by the Federal agency making the application. the Federal action in question is appropriate for further consideration. The review process must be accomplished within 180 days after the receipt of the petition for an exemption and response from the Fish and Wildlife Service. The final determination must be made on the record and thus must be accompanied by a formal hearing process. In addition. the final decision to grant an exemption must be based on criteria set forth in section 7(e) (2) as follows: 1. There is no reasonable and prudent alternative to such action. 2. The action is of national or regional significance. 3. The benefits of such action clearly outweigh the benefits of alternative courses of action consistent with conserving the species or its critical habitat. and that such action is in the public interest. The bill also requires that during the review process. the Endangered Species Committee must address the benefits of all alternatives which might be available in lieu of the proposed action. This criterion makes it clear that the Endangered Species Committee must consider all options which might eliminate harm to the species. independent of the stage of project completion. As a project approaches completion certain alternatives to the proposed action may not be reasonably or prudently available as options. It is also clear that the earlier in the progress of a project a conflict is recognized. the easier it is to design an alternative consistent with the requirements of the act. or to abandon the proposed action. It may be feasible to utilize resources already expended or lands acquired for a proposed action to carry out alternatives. such as the development of parks or wildlife refuges. which are unrelated to the initial project. The Endangered Species Committee should apply this standard of reasonableness in asserting the availability of alternatives to any action before them for review. The criteria in section 7(e) (2) should not be viewed as a limitation on those factors the Endangered Species Committee might deem appropriate for use in making the final decision. It should. however. give some guidance as to those elements that the Congress believes are essential to a reasonable de:ision in cases of conflicts. along with some idea of what emphasis should be given these elements in any decision. It is parti:ularly difficult to assess exactly what facts are or will be important when viewing a particular species within the subsection (e) process. Clearly such genetic. recreational. esthetic. historic. and scientific values of the affected endangered or threatened species should be given weight in any final decision. In the balancing process the Endangered Species Committee is not expected to weigh simply the importance of a species against the value of a Federal action. The criteria expressly mandate that the balancing which is to take place is between the benefits of a proposed Federal project and the benefits of alternative courses of action which will not result in harm to the species or its critical habitat. Although the balancing process is difficult the Endangered Species Committee should note that the decision to allow the extinction of a species or destroy all or parts of its critical habitat must not be taken lightly and great care must be applied in trying to decide finally. in cases of conflict. what future course of action is in the public interest. The bill provides authority for the Endangered Species Committee to issue subpenas for the attendance of witnesses and the production of relevant papers. books. and documents. The authority should be used with restraint. when necessary to obtain information material to an exemption decision. In oversight hearings concerning the Endangered Species Act the committee also received testimony from organizations representing zoos. These witnesses were skeptical of the necessity for the stringent and burdensome process developed by FWS for regulation of their captive bred endangered and threatened species. The committee advises the Service to reexamine these regulations and the rationale upon which they are based in light of this testimony. and to make every effort to insure that only those regulations which result in real benefits for wild populations of endangered and threatened species are retained. In any event. every effort should be made by the Service to reduce the amount of paperwork and time involved in this regulatory process. The committee notes favorably the Fish and Wildlife Service announcement in the April 14. 1978. Federal Register that they are examining the possibility of reclassifying captive endangered species to a less restrictive status under the Endangered Species Act. The committee agrees that some distinctions ought to be made between the regulatory processes relating to captive endangered species so that only those regulations that can be reasonably expected to enhance the protection of endangered species be retained. The committee also received testimony on a related issue. the manner in which the Endangered Species Act affects scientific pursuits. particularly work carried on in museums. In discussions with members of the scientific communities the Fish and Wildlife Service has agreed to reexamine its present regulations. The permit procedures in this regard badly need to be streamlined. Targe amounts of time and money have been committed to compliance with these regulations. although little may be accomplished by control of museum specimens. There is little evidence that such controls have any appreciable effect on existing populations of endangered species. The committee believes that a distinction should be made between regulation of legitimate scientific pursuits and commercial activities involving endangered species. and that regulations should be promulgated which do not unnecessarily impede or obstruct legitimate scientific inquiries. The committee requests that the Fish and Wildlife Service study upgrading the efforts of the Customs Service activities and other alternatives for monitoring and protecting endangered species and report its findings back to the committee within a reasonable time. Mr. President. I think my colleagues will agree that the Committee on Environment and Public Works has completed a comprehensive review of this enormously complicated subject. Let us hope that the deliberations on this bill are conducted so as to resolve these issues With careful consideration of the scientific. ethical. and social implications of the decision we

Madam Chair. the gentleman from Maryland just talked about were not going to call time out. But. ladies and gentlemen. the American people are calling time out. They are ready to put this Congress and this administration and the Federal Reserve into timeout. The time has expired on bailouts. Thats the message we are hearing all over America. Americans are saying no more bailouts. and they are saying no more bailout funds. Thats the primary difference between the Democratic plan and the Republican plan. Once and for all. we say no more bailouts. The American people. quite frankly. dont care about the mechanics. They dont care about the details. What they do care is that they be treated fairly. and they not be obligated for a risk that they didnt take. Thats our plan. Its that simple. If bankruptcy is good enough for American citizens. if its good enough for small businesses. if its good enough for 999 of Americas corporations. it ought to be good enough for the largest ""too big to fail"" institutions. and thats the last thing we put to death with our plan. There wont be any more ""too big to fail."" You take risk or you loan or allow people to take risk with your money. you lose. not the American people. No more bailouts. No more bailouts.

If I am not heard. however. I will change my position. Mr. Chairman. I agree with the distinguished chairman of the Committee on Pacific Railroads in believing that this is a great business proposition. I further agree with him that the time for action has come. But. Mr. Chairman. I do not and can not agree with him and the majority of the committee in believing that the bill now pending is the remedy or is such action as Congress should adopt as a settlement of this important business transaction. a transaction involving. as we have been told. $110.000.000 or $112.000.000. I propose. Mr. Chairman. first briefly to submit my reasons why I believe the report of the majority should not be adopted. I must do so rapidly. for a number of my colleagues and associates desire to be heard. and I have consented to divide my time with three or four other gentlemen. First. I say that the proposition embraced in the relort of the majority is too liberal to the railroad companies. I agree with my friend and colleague the gentleman from Texas . who so eloquently showed this committee on yesterday that the owners of these railroads have not so acted in the past as to entitle them to any further privileges or favors at the hands of the American Government. Yet I have no harsh words for them. Mr. Chairman. I propose to treat with them as I will further show. but I propose to treat with them simply on the basis of a business proposition. and to treat with them becausa I believe they are in a condition to make a better trade with the Government. that is. to pay the Government more on their indebtedness than any other person or persons will or can do. I have endeavored as a member of this committee to gain all the information that I could upon this subject. During the last session of this Congress I devoted all the time I could spare from other Congressional duties tothe hearings before the committee and to reading all of the Government and other reports on the subject. I have reached the conclusion. as the result of my investigations. that this proposition is not only the proposition of the debtor railroad companies. but the proposition of the weaker of the two. and even a worse proposition than that which the Union Pacific Railroad Company had indicated. by the testimony of its attorney. Mr. Pierce. that it was willing and able to make when he first came before the committee. It is true that he afterwards withdrew it. and agreed that perhaps theUnion Pacific could not do better than is proposed in this bill. But. Mr. Chairman. it is an indisputable fact that in these two railroad companies there is a great difference in ability. so great that any reasonable man must admit that the Union Pacific is in better condition to pay. or in a condition to pay more on their indebtedness. than is the Central Pacific. If so. pray tell me why we should accord to it the same terms that we do to the Central Pacific. unless we are under some obligations to grant to this company some special privilegesome privilege not accorded even to its associate. the Central Pacific. That reason alone. -Mr. Chairman. would influence me not to adopt the report of the majority of the committee. Then. sir. upon what sort of testimony is the report based? Examine the report of the hearings before the committee during the past session and you will find that the testimony was in effect ex parte testimony. and that not under oath. but merely upon the statements of gentlemen who had come before the committee of their own accord. Your committee had no power. or at least exercised none. in sending for persons and papers. N No witness was sworn. No one came before the committee except those who voluntarily appeared. The majority report is based upon a statement of the earnings and capacities of these companies. based upon the opinions of parties who are in the main friendly to this scheme. Is that the sort of evidence that the House of Representatives. treating this as a grave business proposition. axe willing to act upon in disposing of a debt of $110.000.000 or $112.000.000? For one I can never consent. either as a member of the committee or as a member of this House. to make a settlement of a question of the magnitude of the one now before us upon such testimony. Again. the distinguished chairman of the committee. the gentleman from Vermont . on yesterday. in reply to the question whether or not the railroad companies could carry into effect the pending bill. answered that they could. I have no doubt that they can. I have some doubt. however. whether or not they will. some time in the far future. be willing to do so. That they not only can do it. but are anxious to accept it is one reason why I am opposed to the bill. It is in effect their proposition. It is. as I understand it. the proposition of the Central Pacific Railroad Company. the weaker. financially. of the two. I believe this company can carry it out. and feel assured that the Union Pacific Company can do so much more easily. The distinguished gentleman from Vermont said that his estimate was based on hard times. It looks to me as though it was not only based on hard times. but. if you believe what was so eloquently said by the gentleman from Texas on yesterday. that it was based on some very hard practices. Mr. BELL showed you how they at least had the opportunity to reduce their net incomes so as to prevent the paying into the Government Treasury what might have been expected under the Thurman Act. I ask the Committee of the Whole House. Are you willing to make a settlement based upon the figures of the distinguished gentleman from Vermont. based. as he says. upon hard prices. and. as the gentleman from Texas has shown you. upon hard practices? I call the attention of the committee to the fact that when the attention of the gentleman from Vermont was called to this. he used this language. ""that everyone must determine for himself as to whether that would be a proper basis."" Now. I ask the members of this committee. How many of you can determine for yourselves. by the facts and figures presented by the committee. what is the income of these railroad companies? Upon what basis can you make this settlement? Are you satisfied in your minds what are the earnings of these railroad companies? The distinguished chairman of the committee frankly tells you that you must determine this for yourselves. Now. I insist and will further on attempt to show to you that we have no information before us upon which we can intelligently settle this question. I submit that the adoption of the report of the committee would be a losing business to the Government. even if it were carried out in good faith by the railroad companies and the 2 per cent interest. as well as the entire principal. paid as provided for in the bill. As has been well said. if we extend this favor. ought we not to receive something for it? Are we under any special obligations to these companies or either of them? Certainly not. I have not time to go into it. but I believe this House will concur with me in answering that we are not. Is this extension of so large a debt worth anything? If so. ought not these companies to give us some additional security for the favor? I say they should. and that they are able to do so. They have proposed to do better in the past. Should they not be required to do so now? I insist that they should be. Under the proposed bill the Government will be no better protected than under the existing law. While an increase in the second mortgages are given over the subsidiary lines and the terminal facilities are included in the proposed bill. the increase in the firstmortgage debt. which this permits. will more than equal the security proposed to be given. and then. in my humble judgment. we will have no better security than we have at present. I respectfully submit. too. in this connection that according to the best evidence. according to the evidence that we have had before this committee. this debt is worth somewhere at least from $50.000.000 to $70.000.000. and it does occur to me that these railroad compa nies who owe it. having underlying securities. something which they wish to save. ought to and will do more. and give us a better proposition than this now presented by the majority report of the committee. I submit upon the evidence. upon the first proposition of the Union Pacific Railroad Company. and upon the fact that two years ago both of these railroad companies were willing to accept the Reilly bill. that there is more in this controversy for the Government than it will receive under the pending bill. At least we have not satisfactory evidence to induce us as Representatives to make a settlement without further inquiry and more information. I am not content simply to oppose this bill. but propose. after spending six months of investigation on the Committee on Pacific Railroads. to submit such suggestions as have occurred to me. My colleague. the gentleman from Missouri [Mr. HUBBARDJ. who first spoke in opposition to this bill. as I understand him. proposes nothing. In fact. he said that he had no measure to propose. and was attempting to put no measure before Congress. While I agree in much that he said. I disagree with him in so far as his conclusions are concerned. yet he offers noremedy. Will it do to simply kill the bill? I think not. for as I said at the beginning. I think the time for action has arrived. and something ought to be done. Some of these bonds have already matured. and many of them will soon mature. What is the remedy? Must we simply kill the bill as offered without bringing in some remedy? If I understand the temper of this House. it is likely to do it. We at least have the precedent of the Fiftythird and Fiftysecond Congresses for killing bills of this sort. Are we to neglect our duty by doing nothing? For if the time of action has arrived we should at least legislate on this subject. If we do not settle it. we should authorize some one to do it. My friend and colleague from Texas has prepared an admirable substitute. which I frankly say if I believed the railroad companies could work up to I would cheerfully support. There is nothing in it that I object to. except that I believe it to be so stringent that the railroad companies could not comply with it. I think the railroad companies would be unable to live up to it. and thus practically there will be no legislation. I think that his bill leans too far against the railroad companies. while I think the bill of the majority leans too much toward their interests and does not properly protect the Government. Entertaining these views. I have submitted a substitute. which the committee will find in the RECORD of yesterday. page 578. which at the proper time I propose to offer. and which I think under all the circumstances the best that Congress can now do. This substitute provides for the appointment of a commission. consisting of the Secretary of the Treasury. the Secretary of the Interior. and the AttorneyGeneral. with full power to settle the questions pending between the Government and these bondaided railway companies. It also provides that any settlement they may agree upon shall be submitted in writing to the President of the United States. and that before it becomes binding it must have received his approval. Now. why should Congress adopt such a plan? I say. first. because Congress has not and can not readily acquire the necessary information upon which to properly act. second. because both Houses of Congress will probably never agree upon a settlement. and in substantiation of that opinion I call attention to the fact that this question has already been before both the Fiftysecond and the Fiftythird Congresses and failed. Many gentlemen here will at least remember the discussion in the Fiftythird Congress on the Reilly bill. which. it is conceded. was a much better measure for the Government than the bill which is now pending. but it was defeated. and as I understand. no bill for a settlement of this question has as yet passed either House of Congress. Such a bill has not merely to run the gantlet here. but also in the Senate. and has to secure the approval of the President. Now. judging the future by the past. are we likely to enact any such measure? If not. what is to become of this indebtedness? This is no new theory. Mr. Chairman. In investigating this matter and trying to find out what remedy ought to be pursued. 1 have noted the fact that President Harrison. in his third annual message. sent to the Fiftysecond Congress. referred to this subject. and I desire to read a short recommendation which he then made: * The rep rt of the Commissioner of Railroads shows that the total debt of the subsidized railroads to the United States was on July 31.1890. $112.512.613.06. A large part of this deht is now fast approaching maturity. and no adequate provision exists for its payment. Some policy for dealing with this debt with a view of its ultimate collection should be at once adopted. It is very difficult and wellnigh impossible for so harge a body as the Congress to conduct the necessary negotiationsand investigations. i therefore recommend that provision be made for the appoinment of a commission to agree upon and report a plan for dealing with this debt. How prophetic does that language of President Harrison appear today. four years later. when we find that. for the very reasns assigned by him. Congress has up to this time been unable to agree upon any legislation on this questionf . Again. I find in the first report of the Commissioner of RailToads. General Hampton. a paragraph upon this subject embodying substantially the same recommendation. which also I will read: In view of the magnitude of the interests involved and of the fact that the funding bill (S 751. iftysecond Congress. first session). which was made the subject of a speciai report. and with sundry amendments recommended for adoption by my predecessor. does not meet with favor by certain officials of the Central Pacific Railroad Company. I would recommend the appointment by the President of a commission with full power to settle the indebtedness of the bondaided Pacific railroads to the Government on terms which shall be honorable to the companies and just to the United States. The appointment of such a commission was urged by my predecessor and recommended by President Harrison. and in view of the many and complex questions involved in the final settlement of all differences between the Government and the subsidized roads. I regard it as of the utmost importance that such action should be taken. It woud be difficult. if not impossible. for a satisfactory adjustment of all the grave questions which must necessarily be considered to be arrived at by so large a body as Congress pressed as the members always are in the ordinary discharge of their public duties. nor is it prohable that any agreement could be reached which would. while protecting the vast interests of the Government be just and equitable to the railroad companies concerned. Some settlement must be. made promptly. for a large portion of the indebtedness of the companies to the Government will mature in a short time. and as the companies are not ina condition to meet their liabilities. the only alternative which will be left to the Government will be to assume ownership of the roads. or to accept such terms as may be proposed by the officials of the companies. As the Government holds only a second mortgage on these roads. in order to secure possession of them all prior liens would have to be paid. and this would involve not only the enormous outlay of. say. 8180.000.000. but would entail the necessity of their operation by the Government. an experiment which has invariably resulted disastrously in this country whenever tried by any State. If this plan is deemed impracticable. the only other alternative looking to the adjustment of all matters pertaining to the subsidized roads is an amicable and ecuitable settlement with the authorities of these roads. and this as I have said. can. in my judgment be best effected by the appointment oi a commission with fullpower to settle all questions involved. he railroad officials express a desire to have a prompt. just.and final adjustment of all differences. and they declare their willingness to pay the Government all dues as fully and as speedily as they possibly can. If the Government can be secured from ultimate loss. the question of time in the payment is of little consequence.

J.. of epileptic dementia. Ella Hatfield. youngest daughter of soldier. has been frail and delicate from infancy and never able to care for herself. She is now 34 years old. and is in a sanitarium for treatment for consumption. Dr. W. H. Martland testifies that he attended and treated her at various times between 1878 and 1888. that she was frail and delicate. and subject to attacks of malaria. disorders of digestion. nervous derangements. debility. and had neurasthenia. with all its complications. I considered her at that time to be physically unfit to perform any kind of labor continuously. Sheis now (November 20. 1895) at a sanitarium in the Adirondacks for treatment for disease of lungs. Dr. J. C. Young testifies to treating her since 1889. and says: ""She is a typical case of neurasthenia. and very suscaptible to disorder of digestion. nervous derangements of various kinds. such as pain. neuralgia. insomnia. and muscular twithings. dehility. faintness. dizziness. and general exhaustion. and Drone to all the effects of malaria. which it is difficult foi her to resist. Latterly. she has become more and more enfeebled. and for the past year can scarcely perform even the simple duties of the household."" In another affidavit of November 20. 1595. Dr. Young states that from dat of former certificate (January 19. 1898) he continued to attend Ella Hatfield until June. 1885. al~d that she continued in the same condition as described ig said certificate. with the addition that toward the end she had cough and pain in chest. that she developed aprolonged character to expiration. which indicated a latent pleurisy. and that. fearing a tendency toward tuberculosiS. she was taken to the sanitarium at Saranac Lake.

My colleagues have pointed out what I think are the serious flaws of the proposal that is currently before the Senate. I will not repeat those arguments. I want to talk about something that I think is broader than the immediate question. and that is the issue of trust. Ultimately the trust of the American people in this institution and its Members is at stake. Our ability to address issues of the day with the confidence of the American people is at stakethat we are addressing those issues in the best interests of those we serve and not those of special interests or the interests of individual members intent on perpetuating their own political careers or ambitions. Ultimately restoring that trust is perhaps the more important issue that is before us today. I think it is fair to say that level of trust has been lost. has been squandered. There are many reasons for it. The question before us is how can we restore that level of trust. The restoration will not come with tinkering with campaign finance laws as this bill purports to do. It will not come in what some have viewed as a cynical search for partisan advantage in the name of reform. We are all aware of the fact that each body. the House of Representatives and the Senate. has carved out for itself a set of rules not designed. in my opinion. to bring about real reform but to find a way that. in the name of reform. we. continue to perpetuate the system that exists. I do not think it will restore public trust and confidence. and I do not think it is the way in which we ought to be addressing the issue that is before us. I would like to talk briefly today about a reform that I think is far more sweeping. It Is uniform. it is fair. far more dramatic. and designed to restore public trust. I hope to speak several additional times in the future on this particular issue as we discuss ways in which we can restore public trust in the institution of Congress. This reform is a change that really is nothing more than a return to an older and. I think. superior ideal .of service and accountability to the people we represent. Before the Civil War. it was a common American conviction that the surest way to avoid the temptations of an imperial Congress was the principle of frequent rotation in office. Americans expected a Government of citizen legislators. not career politicians. And though the principle was voluntary. the public usually got what it wanted because. during the first half of the 19th century. between 40 and 50 percent of the Congress left office after every election. The belief in a regular congressional turnover came to America from a much older tradition. Aristotle had written that democracy was only possible when there was an exchange of ""ruling and being ruled in turn."" The theory is very simple. Public servants will pass better laws if they expect to have to go home and live under them. One delegate to the American Constitutional Convention warned. ""By remaining in the seat of government. legislators would acquire the habits of the place which might differ from those of their constituents."" and that. as we have found. was a monumental understatement. After the Civil War the average duration of congressional service doubled and then it doubled again. It has now reached the logical conclusion in our time. a Congress of entrenched professionals who are only unseated by death. scandal or. in a few isolated cases. their own disillusionment with the way the institution is run. In the process a wall has been constructed. a wall between citizens and legislators. a wall of endless reelection. a wall that has left the body isolated from the very people It seeks to serve. One observer has commented. ""Members of Congress become like the noncustodial parent in a divorced family. They have visitations. they come on holidays and weekends. they send money. but they dont live with us. and over time it becomes harder and harder to really know one another very well."" Mr. President. there are exceptions to this. and we all are aware of those exceptions. Some are serving in this body today. Obviously. a system of term limitations would require those exceptional public servants to retire. and their depth and breadth of knowledge would be missed. But I have come to conclude that the benefits from a healthy. regular rotation of citizen legislators into this body would far exceed the loss of distinguished public servantsmen and womenwho have not allowed that wall to be constructed. who have maintained that relationship with their constituents. who have shielded themselves from the isolation that occurs from serving in this body. from the influence of special interests. who truly can represent the best interests of the Nation and Its people without bowing to the pressures of perpetuating a career in office. But the answer. I think. is as basic as term limitations. If turnover is not voluntary. we must make it mandatory. I have introduced legislation for limited terms calling for six 2year terms in the House. or 12 years there. and two 6year terms in the U.S. Senate. We all know that we already limit the terms of the President. It is a fair question to ask. if limited terms are good enough for the Presidency and Vice Presidency. should they not be good enough for the Congress? Those public servants who serve in the House of Representatives after a 12year period of time obviously would have the option of seeking office in the U.S. Senate. It would be a winnowing out process. moving 435 down to 33 in any one particular year in terms of Senate reelection. Able public servants who have served. in the House of Representatives would be able to move on to the Senate and. If the public so chose. move on to the Vice Presidency and Presidency. But it would be a limitation. It would encourage citizen legislators. Every 2 years about 16 percent of the Congress would retire. The goal would be a slow. gradual. but effective revolution. a revolution in the attitude of Congress and in the confidence of Americans. Our Nation would find public servants who came from the real world and planned to return there. They would find public servants who expect to live much of their productive lives under the laws and regulations that they pass and under the taxes that they might raise. They would find public servants freed from the endless campaigning of career politics. and allowed to deal with the real issues facing the American public. They would find public servants connected to their community and its needs by experience. not just by sympathy. This is the kind of congressional reform that would do more than shift the distribution of money and power. it would restore trust. I submit that restoring trust in this institution is absolutely essential if we are to go forward and deal with the very real problems facing this country in the decade of the nineties and beyond. Without that restoration of trust. we cannot provide: answers to our health care crisis. education reforms. economic reforms. issues that face the American public. Without the confidence and trust of the American people these efforts will be just so many empty words and so. many empty proposals. ..

C.. March 30. 1904. Ron. BOIES PENRosE. United States Senator. Chatsman Commnittee on PostOffices and PostRoads. DEAR Sit: My name is O. L. Teachout. resident of St. Louis. Mo.. and am general agent of the mail department of the Missouri Pacific Railway. In view of this position I am in charge of all matters connected with the transportation of United States mail. and consequently an amendment to the postoffice appropriation bill which was added in the House. refdfing as follows: ""Provided. That no part of the amount hereby appropriated shall be expended for the use of cars in the railway postal service that have been used in said service for a period of more than fifteen years"" was of great interest to me. While this has been stricken out in the Senate. I thought I would give you a few of the reasons why this amendment should not become law. which might be of use in case of a conference committee. The Missouri Pacific Railway have in use and reserve nearly forty railway postoffice cars. Of these ten have been built more thun fifteen years. iherefore about 25 per cent of these cars. if such an amendment became law. would not earn pay. notwithstanding they are strong. serviceable cars. and without doubt the larger railroad systems have as great or greater per cent which would not earn pay under these circumstances as the Missouri Pacific. These cars run between St. Louis and Kansas Cily. Mo. They are thoroughly inspected each trip. and in case any portion of them shows weakness it is at once removed and iew material substituted. The trucks are renowed whenever necessary and the superstructure the same. Without doubt they are in as good condition as cars which have been in use not more than half that length of time. and arbitrarily putting these cars out of service when they are in good order would worr a great hardship upon this company. I trust that there will be no effort to replace this amendment in the bill. but if there should be. hope the Senate conference committee will firmly resist it. Very respectfully. 0. L. TEACHOUT. General Agent Mail Department. Missouri Pacific Rai!way. As I understand in conversing with railroad men. those having charge of the roads in Missouri. every time a car is sent out and returned it is critically examined. If there is a flaw. a defect. or a weakness discovered. the car is sent tothe shop and is replaced. If any part of it is defective or broken. that is replaced. Some cars that have been in service thirty years are practically new cars. and as strong as any new car. Why just fifteen years should be selected as the lifetime of a car I can not imagine. It would be a great injustice to limit the life of a car to fifteen years. We all think that no weak. defective car ought to be allowed. but the strength of it does not depend upon the number of years it has been in use. it depends upon the treatment it has received. Now. it is to the interest of the railroad companies to minimize the damages that may result from the breaking of cars from weakness in cars. Inspections are made. and if any defect is discovered it is remedied. I hope that the amendment striking out the House provision will be sustained. I believe that it is in the interest of good service that it should be sustained.\n'",wish read letter address chairman committee gentleman connect long time superintendent division several year connect mail department c name resident general agent mail department view position charge matter connect transportation mail amendment postoffice appropriation bill add refdfe follow provide part amount appropriate expend use car railway_postal service use say service period more year great interest stricken think give few reason amendment become law use case conference committee use reserve railway_postoffice car build more year per_cent car amendment become law earn pay strong serviceable car doubt large railroad system great great cent earn pay circumstance car run inspect trip case portion show weakness remove iew material substitute truck renowe necessary superstructure same doubt good condition car use more length time put car service good order worr great hardship company trust effort replace amendment bill hope conference committee resist understand converse railroad man have charge road time car send return examine flaw defect weakness discover car send tothe shop replace part defective broken replace car service year new car strong new car year select lifetime car imagine great injustice limit life car year think weak defective car allow strength depend number year use depend treatment receive interest railroad company minimize damage result breaking car weakness car inspection make defect discover remedied hope amendment strike provision sustain believe interest good service sustained.\n,58.0,bound,0,1

1060001078,S,19990119,290,Mr. JEFFORDS,Unknown,JEFFORDS,Unknown,M,61458,61729,01191999.txt,9230,656,106113101,JEFFORDS,JAMES,S,VT,M,R,,voting,"Mr. President. on this first legislative day of the 106th Congress I rise in the Senate Chamber to express my strong support for the bill Senator SNOWE and I are introducingand urge my Senate colleagues to join as cosponsors of this important legislation. Throughout -the last Congress the Senate spent many legislative hours debating campaign finance reform. In fact. since my election to the House in the wake of the Watergate scandal. I have spent many long hours working with my colleagues to craft campaign finance reform legislation that could endure the legislative process and survive a constitutional challenge. We came close in 1994 and last year. and I believe circumstances still remain right for enactment of meaningful campaign finance reform during this Congress. I believe that the irregularities associated with our recent campaigns. and especially in the 1996 elections. point out the fact that current election laws are not being strongly enforced or working to achieve the goals that we all have for campaign finance reform. The proof obtained from the. hearings in both the House and the Senate* on campaign finance abuses should alone be enough to motivate my colleagues to complete work on this issue in the Senate. Without action. these abuses will become more pronounced and widespread as we go from election to election. The SnoweJeffords bill. the Advancing Truth and Accountability of Campaign Communications Act (ATACC). will boost disclosure requirements and tighten the rule on expenditures of corporate and union treasury funds in the weeks preceding a primary and general election. I would like to begin with a story that may help my colleagues understand the need for this legislation. and that many of my colleagues may understand from their own campaigns. Two- individuals are running for the Senate and have spent the last few months holding debates. talking to the voters and traveling around the state. Both candidates feel that they have informed the voters of their thoughts. views and opinions on the issues. and that the voters can use this information to decide on which candidate they will support. Two weeks before the day of the election a group called the People for the Truth and the American Way. lets say. begins to run television advertisements which include the picture of one of the candidates and that candidates name. However. these advertisements do not use the express terms of ""vote for"" or ""vote against."" These advertisements discuss issues such as the candidates drinking. supposed offshore bank accounts and the failure of the candidates business. The voters do not know who this group is. who are its financial backers and why they have an interest in this specific election. and under our current election law the voters will not find out. Thus. even though the candidates have attempted to provide the voters with all the information concerning the candidates views on the issues. they will be casting their vote lacking critical information concerning these advertisements. Some people may say that voters do not need this information. But as James Madison said. ""A popular government without popular information is but a prologue to a tragedy or a farce or perhaps both. Knowledge will forever govern ignorance and a people who mean to be their own governors must arm themselves with the power which knowledge gives."" Mr. President. the ATACC act will arm the people with the knowledge they need in order to sustain our popular government. And the need to arm the people with this knowledge is becoming greater every year. As mycolleague Senator SNOWS has stated. the amount of money spent on issue advocacy advertising is increasing over time at an alarming rate. In the -19951996 election cycle an estimated $135150 million was spent on issue advocacy. while in the recently completed cycle an estimated $275340 million was expended on these types of advertisements. This is a doubling of the amount of money spent on issue advocacy ads in one election cycle. and I fear entering an election cycle that includes a Presidential election that we may see at least another doubling of these type of expenditures. I have long believed in Justice Brandeis statement that. ""Sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants."" The disclosure requirements in the ATACC act are narrow and tailored to provide the electorate with the important pertinent information they will need to make an informed decision. Information included on the disclosure statement includes the sponsor of the advertisement. amount spent. and the identity of the contributors who donated more than $500. Getting the public this information will greatly help the electorate evaluate those who are seeking federal office. Additionally. this disclosure. or disinfectant as Justice Brandeis puts it. will also help deter actual corruption and avoid the appearance of corruption that many already feel pervades our campaign finance system. This. too. is an important outcome of the disclosure requirements of this bill. Getting this information into the public purview would enable the press. the FEC and interest groups to help ensure that our federal campaign finance laws are obeyed. If the public doesnt feel that the laws Congress passes in this area are being followed. this will lead to a greater level of disillusionment in their elected representatives. Exposure to the light of day of any corruption by this required disclosure will help reassure our public that the laws will be followed and enforced. While our bill focuses on disclosure. it will also prohibit corporations and unions from using general treasury monies to fund these types of electioneering communications in a defined period close to an election. Since 1907. federal law has banned corporations from engaging in electioneering. In 1947. that ban was extended to prohibit unions from electioneering as well. The Supreme Court has upheld these restrictions in order to avoid the deleterious influences on federal elections resulting from the use of money by those who exercise control over large aggregations of capital. By treating both corporations and unions similarly we extend current regulation cautiously and fairly. I feel that this prohibition. coupled with the disclosure requirements. will address many of the concerns my colleagues from both sides of the aisle have raised with regards to our current campaign finance laws. Mr. President. I think it is important to clarify at this time some of the things that this bill will not do. It will not prevent grassroots lobbying communications. it does not cover printed material. nor require the text or a copy of the advertisement to be disclosed. Finally. it does not restrict how much money can be spent on ads. nor restrict how much money a group raises. These points must be expressed early on to ensure that my colleagues can clearly understand what we are and are not attempting to do with our legislation. We have taken great care with our bill to avoid violating the important principles in the First Amendment of our Constitution. This has required us to review the seminal cases in this area. including Buckley v. Valeo. Limiting corporate and union spending and disclosure rules has been in area that the Supreme Court has been most tolerant of regulation. We also strove to make the requirements sufficiently clear and narrow to over come unconstitutional claims of vagueness and over breadth. Mr. President. I wish I could guarantee to my colleagues that these provisions would be held constitutional. but as we found out with the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. even with near unanimous support. it is difficult to gauge what the Supreme Court will decide on constitutional issues. However. I feel that the provisions we have created follow closely the constitutional roadmap established by the Supreme Court by the decisions in this area. and that it would be upheld. I know that campaign finance reform is an areas of diverse viewpoints and beliefs. However. I feel that the ATACC act offers a constructive and constitutional solution that addresses some of the problems that have been expressed concerning our current campaign finance system. The American people are watching and hoping that we will have a fair. informative and productive debate on campaign finance reform. I know that the proposal that Senator SNOWE and I have put forward will do just that. The electorate has grown more and more disappointed with the tenor of campaigns over the last few years. and this disappointment is reflected in the low number of people that actually participate in what makes this country and democracy great. voting. I feel that giving the voters the additional information required by our legislation will help dispel some of the disillusionment the electorate feel with our campaign system and reinvigorate people to participate again in our democratic system. In conclusion. the very basis of our democracy requires that an informed electorate participate by going to the polls and voting. The ATACC act will through its disclosure requirements inform our electorate and lead people to again participate in our democratic system.

I rise today to acknowledge the retirement of Dr. Herschel Cutler from the Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries. ISRI. Dr. Cutler. ISRIs former Executive Director. spent the last 33 years of his life teaching the Nation. including the Congress. about the environmental and economic benefits of recycling. In the course of his tenure. ISRI has become a highly respected trade association known for its dedication to both environmental protection and private sector entrepreneurialism. He had a wonderful knack for hiring extraordinary staff. And. by example. Herschel taught them to do their homework. acquire a deep understanding of their issues. keep their standards high. develop reasonable solutions to problems and. with regard to public policy. to never overreach. Herschel Cutler is not an Arkansan. But. shortly after my first election to serve as a member of the other body. I met him over dinner through fellow Arkansans whose family recycling business was an ISRI member company. During that dinner Herschel gave me a succinct but thorough description of a serious dilemma facing the scrap recycling industry and its possible resolution. After listening to him discuss the concerns facing the many families in the recycling industry. including many Arkansas families. it was easy for me. a farmers daughter. to identify with a key concern facing them. That is. certain government policies were. inadvertently. having the effect of causing many recycling families to wonder whether they should remain with their businesses. That dinner was the beginning of a long and fruitful relationship between me. Dr. Cutler. and the entire scrap recycling industry. Herschel Cutlers earnest integrity convinced me that the recycleis cause was worth fighting for. I began that fight in 1993. It ended in 1999. after I teamed up with Senators DASCHLE and Lor. BAUCUS. and CHAFEE to amend the Superfund law to correct a mistake directed at recyclers that nobody had intended. Dr. Herschel Cutler and I have been fast friends ever since. As he retires on January 31. 2001. I cannot thank him enough for his guidance and his counsel to me over the years since we first met. He is truly a modest man of great wisd6m. integrity and intellect. Upon his retirement the Washington association community is much the poorer. And with his counsel absent from the daily give and take of public policy discussions in the Congress. so are all of his many friends in both houses. Herschel.

In many months it is not just subfreezing. it is subzero. When you get to northern Maine. we are talking about 20 or 30 below zero many days. We have a lot of poor people in our State. There are some 62.000 people who are beneficiaries of this particular program. Many of them are elderly. Forty or 45 percent of those that receive LIHEAP benefits around the country are elderly. So we are putting people who have an income of approximately $8.000. whose energy bills consume almost 18 percent of their income. and we are now saying cut the program out. prices are low enough that they can afford it. But they cannot afford it. This is a small program compared to some others that are provided to the citizens of this country. I know it may be nice to live in a warm climate. It has been mild here in Washington. as I am sure it is in the West. In the Northeast. and throughout the industrial belt. it is very cold.

For years they have heralded all over the coaintry. from house to house. dangers of attack from foreign foes. It has been a well conceived and a wisely arranged program. they made it do overtime. and have used every device that ingenuity could invent to bring about its adoption. From its adoption enormous profits will be derived they hope and their riches will multiply. They would precipitate war. if they could. They place the dollar above human life. They would have everybody go but themselves. They want war. but they want others to do the fighting. and as the result of war they will pile up fortunes and enjoy ease. Wretched. indeed. must be the man whose avarice inspires such an unholy purpose. But the truth exists. and with the mask torn off exposes the devilish purpose. Aye. to employ the ships for commercial purposes does not meet their approbation or serve their selfish designs. They are opposed to employing them for such useful purposes. and would prefer to see them rot in our harbors in order that they might duplicate the orders. But the President of these United States believes in peace and the employment of our facilities for peaceful pursuit and the extension of our commerce. and he will have them employed to promote our commerce and building up our merchant marine. He is not a favorite among the specialprivilege class. but has dedicated himself to the service of the people and they place their reliance in him to employ every facility in his power to advance the welfare of the people. He will be returned to his great office for another term at the coming election. and the people know he will continue the great work he has begun. so that whatever is done will redound to their benefit. He has done more than any other President to make America great and powerful. to elevate the standard of Americanism. and to open the door of opportunity for all the people. He will make this work. when completed. serve their interest and spread the prosperity the country now so abundantly enjoys. If it were not for the purpose for which these ships can be employedand. in my judgment. will beand the manner provided for the raising of the money to pay for this preparedness that has been mapped out I would never give it my support. but the men who have been crying for great preparation in this country. thank God. are to assist in paying for it. under the new revenue bill which passed the House and will soon pass the Senate. It lays the burden for this proposition where it properly belongs. It distributes the expense correctly and enables those who have demanded preparedness to have the opportunity to pay their rightful share for it. It Is a patent fact that since the revenue bill passed the House the clamor for preparedness has not been so strong as before. and many dangers then existing have disappeared. and the alarm is not so serious as before. Now. one other proposition. Since there has been incorporated in the legislation to carry out the preparedness program the proposition to build an armorplate plant and manufacture the Army supplies which the Government may need. the ardor of those demanding large increased armament and preparedness in this country has been dampened. They have quieted down. their fears were allayed as they saw the opportunity for large profits disappear. They started the agitation in this country for a selfish purpose and have continued it. but n6w they have less grave fears of dangers which before they thought more ominous. Now they are not so enthusiastic for the proposition. Gentlemen. when you come to pay for this proposition. when you levy the taxes as proposed. by the new revenue measure. it will dampen the enthusiasm of the men who have been loudest in the ary for great preparedness in this country and they will be less apprehensive of dangers from foreign attacks.

I call upon the Commission. as I did a year ago. to justify the policy reflected in these tables if it can do so. Year after year the Communications Commission comes before the Committee on Appropriations of this House. Year after year it indicates that important questions of policy are under consideration. Year after year there have been discuszed such matters as the proper policy in respect to experimental licenses. the proper policy in respect to newspaper ownership of radio stations. to which the gentleman from New York has just referred. the proper policy in respect to a charge in the form of license fee or otherwise which might fairly be imposed on the holders of Federal licenses. licenses obtained without the payment of a single cent. licenses enabling the holders to command an annual income amounting to well over $100.000.000. No progress appears to have been made in a solution of these and other important matters of policy by the Commission.

I thank my distinguished and good friend for yielding. and. as an aside. I want to thank him for his kind comments that related to the comments of the gentleman from Wisconsin . Let me make one minor correction to the statement. virtually all of which I agreed with. of the distinguished gentleman from Massachusetts . The real power in the House on that issue rested with the gentleman from Massachusetts. not the President. The reason tAe Speaker did not bring a bill up was that we could not get majority support in either party. as symbolized by some of the concerns of the gentleman from Massachusetts. But I also think from a historical perspective. to be fair to the President. it is important to point out that a point was reached 4 months ago in which the leadership. which was working on the issue. came to the conclusion that majority support was un. likely to be achieved on a timely basis and this information was conveyed to the President with the recommendation. given the significant diceyness of the day. that he act utilizing executive authority at that time. So the recommendation came on a timing basis from the Congress of the United States. from the leadership of the Congress. recognizing that Members. like the gentleman from Vermont and the gentleman from California and the gentlewoman from Ohio did not support the legislation. and that Executive initiative that we believed. after careful legal review was legal and was constitutional. should be taken. But I want to make the distinction between ESF and certain appropriated programs. The Exchange Stabilization Fund was established. I believe. in 1934. The original appropriation. and my understanding is the only appropriation. was about $200 million. It now has resources of about $42 billion. which relate to earnings In the fund in interventions and defense of the dollar and other currencies. So we are talking about a fund that was built up 95plus percent outside the appropriations process. Mr. Chairman. I would also stress that the Exchange Stabilization Fund allows us the capacity to quickly intervene. If we unilaterally disarm our capacity to defend the U.S. dollar. overnight we will precipitate a weakening of the dollar. In macroeconomic terms. this will cause a rising of interest rates. which will be to the disadvantage of the United States of America. I would also state that it will weaken the United States capacity to maintain a principal role as a major reserve currency. That role allows seniorage. which earns us a great deal of money every year and is also a stabilizing influence for American business. A gyrating dollar is not in the interest of the United States commerce. I wouldalso stress that in many regards the Mexican crisis represents the first issue of a new financial order. In that crisis. in a bipartisan way. the President of the United States worked with the new leadership of another party in the Congress. and came up with an ad hoc bipartisan approach which also provoked bipartisan criticism. I would say to the gentlewoman from Ohio and the gentleman from Vermont that there are two parts of your argument I totally agree with. It would have been vastly preferable for Congress to have acted. Itis also true that this is an unprecedented usage of these funds in terms of magnitude. although not in principle. Having said that. I personally believe the President of the United States is to be credited. The Speaker of the House is to be credited. The minority leader is to be credited with working to try to constructively come up with an irrangement which is legalalthough with unprecedented aspectsand which fits the times. Mr. Chairman. nothing could be more ironic. that after what appears at an early stage to be an extraordinarily successful program. we were to undercut that program and at the same time. in the same way. weaken the capacity of the United States to work in traditional ways with the Exchange Stabilization Fund to defend the dollar trade. Why do we not let free markets in the future. work?

Mr. President. I begin our side of the debate. I rise in favor of the McCainFeingoldLieberman amendment. I hope we will have an overwhelming vote later this afternoon in favor of full disclosure of the contributions and expenditures of 527 organizations. As we discussed yesterday on the floor. these organizations are the new stealth player in our electoral system. They claim a tax exemption under section 527 of the Internal Revenue Code. a provision that was intended to cover political committees such as party organizations or PACs. At. the same. time. they refuse to register with the Federal Election Commission and report their activities like other political committees because they claim they are not engaged socalled express advocacy. In other words. these groups admit. they exist for the purpose of influencing elections for purposes of the tax laws. but deny- they are political committees for purposes of the election laws. That. my colleagues. is the very definition of evading the law. If it is legal. it is. as some have called it. the ""mother of all loopholes."" I make one point crystal clear because- our debates on campaign finance reform often get bogged down in arguments over whether someone is engaged in. electioneering or simply discussing issues. These groups cannot claim that their purpose is simply to raise issues or promote their views on issues to the public. Why is that? They cant make that claim because to qualify for the section 527 tax exemption. they have to meet the definition of a political organization in the tax code. And that definition is as follows: The term ""political organization"" means a party. committee. association. fund. or other organization ... organized and operated primarily for the purpose of directly or indirectly accepting contributions or making expenditures. or both. for an exempt function. And the term exempt function means: The function of influencing or attempting to influence the selection. nomination. election. or appointment of any individual to any Federal. State. or local public office or office in a political organization. or the election of Presidential or VicePresidential electors. These groups selfidentify as groups whose primary purpose is to accept contributions or make expenditures to influence an election. These are by definition electionrelated groups. They refuse to register with the FEC. and they therefore can take any amount of money from anyonefrom a wealthy patriotic American. or a multinational corporation. or a foreign dictator. or a mobster. Indeed the groups seem to revel in the fact that their activities are completely secret. This chart we will be presenting in a moment shows a public statement by a 527 organization called ""Shape the Debate."" This organization. according to newsreports. is connected with our former colleague and- the former Governor of California. Pete Wilson. On its webpage. Shape the Debate advertises for contributions. Contributions. it says. can be given in unlimited amounts. they can be from any source. and they are not political contributions- and are not a matter of public record. They are not reported to the FEC. to any State- agency. or to the IRS. Mr. President. the amendment we will vote on this afternoon wont change the fact that the contributions can be in any amount. It wont change the fact that the contributions can come from any source. even foreigncontributions. even the proceeds of criminal activity. I regret that -all it will do is address this third claimthat the contributions are not a matter of public record. If a group is. going to accept money from a foreign government. the American people should know that. Thats all were saying here. This is something. the Congress hasto do. Now. It is clear that the FEC is not going to act on this issue this year. It held a meetingon May 25 to discuss a proposal by Commissioner Karl Sandstrom to get a handle on all the secret money that is now flowing into elections. The FEC voted to have the staff prepare a recommendation. but made it very clear that it is not going to act in time to have any impact on the upcoming elections. In fact one commissioner even said ""I want to speak in favor of secrecy."" As Commissioner Scott Thomas said recently when the FEC deadlocked on whether it should pursue enforcement actions against the Clinton and Dole presidential campaigns for their issue ads in 1996: ""You can put a tag on the toe of the Federal Election Commission."" The Commission is moribund. it is powerless even to address the most serious loophole ever to arise. This is why Congress must act. We dont know just how big this problem will be. And we wont ever really know because these groups dont even disclose their existence. Only enterprising news reporters have been able to get information on these groups and their spending. Some estimate that over $100 million in political advertising will come from 527 groups this year. Here are some of the examples that we know of so far. The executive director of the Sierra Club admitted that a handful of wealthy anonymous donors have given about $4.5 million to the groups 527 organization. Shape the Debate. the group whose website advertisement I cited earlier. has said it expects to raise $2 to $3 million for phone issue ads. It has already run ads against Vice President GORE. We know that Republican for Clear Air. with money from the Wyly brothers who are big contributors to Governor Bush ran over $2 million in ads attacking Senator MCCAIN in the New York primary election earlier this year. And a report in. Roll Call a few weeks ago indicates that a groupcalled Council for Responsible Government has formed a 527 and will raise over $2 million and target 25 races this fall.

Of course. I am not exactly known as one of the big spenders. It was after considerable discussion that I went along with the proposal of transfer authority of 5 percent. Maybe it is a dangerous precedent. There was a precedent here once before for transfer authority of a much lesser percentage when money was more available. That was rescinded. I like to think this could be rescinded in the years to come if it is not necessary. Mr. President. the problem arisesit is not that I am this anxious to have the 5percent authority back and forth. That is exactly why we went to the trouble to make sure to have the complete approval of the subcommittees of both the House and the Senate. as well as the entire Appropriations Committee. As I have said. there are over 15 seperate accounts within the Department of the Treasury. some extremely large and some very small. As the legislation calls for in the amendment. not over 5 percent can be transferred out of any one fund or more than 5 percent added to one account. I look at the large accounts of the Treasury Department. like the taxpayers service and return processing. which takes over $867 million. I look at examinations and appeals. where we are appropriating $933 million. I look at the investigations and collections. $617 million. Then I look at the smaller ones. like the office of the Secretary with $36 million. the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center. $14 million. Five percent does not amount to very much when you take it out of those small accounts. If you are able to transfer it over to something like IRS work. it may be only a very small percentage into their account. but it is a big percentage out of the account that you made transfer from. This is a thing that troubles me. I would like to go along with 2 percent. but I hope it would be with the understanding of everybody in the Chamber that when they are in a real bind and it is very obvious to us that it is. that we take care of their problems with supplemental appropriations. I do not know whether we do it this way and make them live with their money or let them spend it all any way they want to and transfer. They will not have to do that now. They could come back.

The proposition is to place all the articles named in the schedule. D. included under the general term ""wood and woodenwares.""

It seems to me it is hardly right to select that class of manufactures and place them upon the freelist. I am equally at a loss to understand either the recommendations of the Tariff Commission or of the Finance Committee of the Senate when they propose in no way to reduce the taxation upon these articles. The bill that we are considering is a bill to reduce taxation. We have a right to expect and believe that it contemplates a general reduction of taxation. We have been told that there will result from it a reduction of taxation. which I think has been stated at from 20 to 25 per cent. Now we come to the articles made from wood and to woodenware. which are used in some degree by alost every person in. the United States. Those of us who live in the Northwestern States know that the article of lumber is very largely used all through States like Iowa and Nebraska and Kansas. I should like to have a good reason to give my people when I go home why. in reducing taxation. there has been no reduction whatever upon timber.

There ]siny be the machinery and the plans by which this money cln be carried effectively to Europe. so as to bring about a better condition of affairs in Europe and to stabilize Europe. but this Congress has not got them. There may be a sufficient and conelusive reason as to why this money should be appropriated..as a part. as the Senator from Massachusetts says. of the program of finishing up this war. but the Congress has not any such facts before it. No one is responsible. for the expenditure of this: money and for the burden which will be. placed upon. the people of this country in gathering this money in the way of taxes save and except the Congress of the United States.. which is wV.holly without the facts. We can. not hold. Mr. Hoover responsible. and neither can the people of this country hold Mr. Hoover responsible in any way for the expenditure of this money under the terms of this bill. It is a wide. latitudinous power .given to him to. expend. $100.000.000 in what is: said to be the. regenerating of an entire Continent. We. are entirely without information as to how it is to be. made effective We are wholly without facts as to where it is to. go.. except in a most general wayso general that it furnishes- no information at alL to you and to me. and yet we are the only people in this entire movement who are responsible to the taxpayers of this country. I venture to say. Mr. President. that if a man stood at the head of a vast business institution that was authorized to take trust money and had trust funds: in its possession and should be asked to transfer them to. the use. of a cause. however humanitarian. and just it might be. with no more protection and no other safeguards than are authorized by this bill. when he was called upon to report upon these trust funds his defense would not be heard in a court of justice. The thing of which I complain. sir. is placing me. as a humble. Member of this body. in a position where I must answer. as a Member of this body. to the taxpayers of the country.. without giving me any information by which and by means whereof I can. report to. them at any time in my public career. This fund is not ours.. and there. can be no more serious duty devolving upon the. Congress of the United States right now than that of adding a further burden to the already harried and overburdened people of this country. The time has passed. Mr. President. when It is no longer a serious matter to appropriate large. sums. of money in this country. It may bethat we are compelled. by reason of the circumstances which surround us and the environments which envelop us. to appropriate these. sums of money. but we can only do. it. sir. after the most thorough and complete investigation and after- the fullest and most complete facts are before us- so. as to justify us not only in the law but in the court of conscience for having done so. What reason could we assign. if this money should be ex--. Vended in a profitless way...in a. fruitless way. or in territory of which we did not approve.? What would be our remedy. and what response would we give to. those. whose money we had expended? There is another reason which makes it impossible for me to support this bill. It is an unpleasant one to mention. never-. theless. it is here. I recognize in Mr. Hoover a man of great ability. It is not my purpose. by anything which I shall say. to challenge his personal integrity. but his viewpoint of things is such that. it makes it impossible for me to turn over a hundred million dollars to him to expend in Europe. For the last four weeks I have been making a pretty thorough study of the relationshipy of the Food Administration tothe vast concerns of this country which control and dominate the food: supply of this country. and I say here upon the floor. and I challenge successful contradiction. that three of the vast monopolies which. control food in this country have. with relation to their commodities. directed and controlled the Food Administration since its organization. I do not mean by that to. say. sir. that Mr. Hoover himself has received any personal or individual benefit by reason of that. I simply mean to say that his viewpoint is such that he permits those people to. in. effect. fix their own prices and to- arrange their own affairs to such an extent that it is a case of an individual dealing with himself in the transactions. I have been utterly amazed -at the facts which show how these combines have influenced and controlled the situation. It is wcll known. sir. that the meat packers of this country have been one of the great. powerful units in. this matter of furnisling food. Now. sir. at a time when the people of this. country are hungry. when our own people are suffering. when. according to the Associated Press dispatches a few days agoM. hundreds of thousands of children in New York and Chicago and other great cities are not only kept out of school for want of. clothes but are actually (lying for want of food. when mothers are committing suicide because they can not respond to the lips that are begging for food. it is a fact. demonstrated over the sirnature of the meat packers themselves. that their profits under Mr. Hoover amounted to all the way from 20 to 40 per cent for the last two. years. Shall I be- calleI upon.. under my oath as a Senator here. to turn over a hundred million dollars to feed. the poor of Europe. when I am notified that out of that $100.000.000 those that control the food products of this country will ask. and probably receive. from 25 to 40- per cent prolit on their investments-? They say ""This Is to be turned over to. the President."" Now. let us be honest. and. eliminate the. President. We know that it is absolutely impossible for the President to know anything about the details of this expenditure. With the stupendous burdens resting upon his- shoulders which are now there. with the difficulties- which confront him. with. the fearful task which is ls. do we suppose for a moment that he will be familiar with a single detail in regard to this matter? It is unfair to the situation and unjust to us to say that the President Is: responsible. He is not responsible. He will know nothing about it from the beginning to the end. We are responsible.

Such a result would be detrimental to the Government service both from the standpoint of increased costs in training new employees and from loss of efficiency. The Federal service might also be adversely affected through the loss of morale on the part of deputy marshals whose tenure In office would become uncertain.

I urge my colleagues to support the Andean Trade Preference Extension Act of 2009. which will extend the Andean trade preferences. as we know as ATPA. and also the Generalized System of Preferences. we also refer to as GSP. for an additional year. However. I do think its important to note my disappointment that we did not put a message specifically putting Ecuador on notice that its behavior and its receipt of continued benefits is at serious risk. There is a deteriorating investment climate in Ecuador as well as their repudiation of the bilateral investment treaty. I think its very important that while it is understood in this legislation that there is language maintaining a review. I am concerned that there is not specific language aimed at challenging Ecuadors actions. I do think this is a change from current law and its a step backward. I think its important to send a strong message that any central tenet of a preference program is that the participants uphold their commitments to the rule of law as well as their commitments to the U.S. on investment and other matters. So as a result of this. I believe preference programs should not be viewed as an entitlement. that they are based upon meeting certain criteria as I mentioned. particularly. as others have said. the observance of labor and environmental laws. certainly actions to prevent the distortion of investment as well as the support and enforcement of intellectual property laws as well as reasonable access to markets. However. I do think despite these concerns. this legislation is extremely important. It is essential that we extend this for another year. I think that this is an important step to take. and I will support its passage. I look forward to working with the administration as well as my colleagues on the Ways and Means Committee.

Another thing is that in the county where the applicant lives every applicant can go to the clerk of the court and he can get identification that he is the one actually applying for this land. hence no chance for duplication of registration.. no chance for dummies. no chance for fraud or error.

Many men in our Oklahoma openings got notarial commissions in some way who were not entitled to them. and under ordinary conditions could not get them. The right way to do is to let each man apply where he Is known. where he can get identification. and go before the clerk of the court or the judge of the court and have his application made out in the usual way. He can then go down and drop It into the postoffice and mail it to the board that is conducting the opening. and he will then have it put into this Pandoras box. or large wheel. as it was in our case. and it will be placed in an envelope. and they will then have the drawing. and the man who is fortunate enough to get the land will have an opportunity to get on the train. go and examine the land. and later enter the land.

It will have the effect of increasing revenue sharing payments by 25 percent in 1983. In fact. I favor an even greater increase. I am convinced that a 50percent increase in revenue sharing would be an even more effective way of putting people back into jobs. Revenue sharing has a proven record of success. It is effective. In the decade since the start of the program. Mr. President. revenue sharing funds have been used by thousands of communities within this country to finance essential programs.

The Constitution of the United States has two provisions with reference to the right to vote. The first is contained in article I. in its relation to the qualifications of persons who are permitted to vote for Members of Congress. The other is contained in the 17th amendment and has reference to persons who ca n vote for Members of the Senate. These two constitutional provisions provide. in virtually identical language. that in order to have the right to vote for a Member of the House of Representatives or a Senator. a person must possess the qualifications prescribed for electors of the most numerous branch of the State legislature in the State in which he resides. This being true. the Constitution of the United States gives to the States the rights to prescribe qualifications of voters for candidates for the House of Representatives and the Senate. subject to two limitations. The first is the limitation of the 15th amendment. that the States cannot deny or abridge the right of any man to vote because of race. color. or previous condition of servitude. The other is the amendment on womens suffrage. the 19th amendment. which provides that the States shall not deny or abridge the right of any citizen to vote on account of sex.\n',least go provision reference right vote first contain article relation qualification person permit vote member other contain 17th amendment reference person n vote member constitutional provision provide identical language order right vote person possess qualification prescribe elector_numerous branch legislature reside true give right prescribe_qualification voter candidate subject limitation first limitation 15th amendment deny_abridge right man vote race previous condition_servitude other amendment women_suffrage 19th amendment provide deny_abridge right citizen vote account_sex.\n,85.0,bound,0,1

I am beginning a third consecutive week of intensive campaigning in the House for the Bureau of Reclamation project near Waurika. Okla. This week the Senate passed the Waurika bill. As of the present the bill is in the subcommittee in this House. I wish to take this opportunity to say that I appreciate the position of the gentleman from Texas. the Honorable WALTER ROGERS. My Texas colleague. as chairman of the House Subcommittee on Irrigation and Reclamation. is under a constant barrage of requests from not only me but also other Members of Congress for projects in their districts. Mr. Rocm. s. whose district borders mine. and I are longtime friends. I wish to publicly thank him for his generous remarks he made to Don Morrison. publisher of the Waurika NewsDemocrat. Thursday. Also. the same appreciation goes to the gentleman from Colorado. the Honorable WAYNE ASPINALL. We do appreciate his position as chairman of Interior and Insular Affairs Committee. We wish to cooperate with him in every way. I feel now that I can tell my constituents back home that if the slightest chance arises whereby the Waurika project can get hearings. my two fine colleagues will. along with the rest of the committee. give the Waurika project their time and consideration. Wednesday. I talked with 28 of the 31 members of the Interior and Insular Affairs Committee. The majority of these members. both Democrats and Republicans. will favor this project. The only problem is getting it on the already heavily loaded calendar. Earlier this week. Mr. J. M. Bullard. Duncan. Mr. Don Morrison. Waurika. and Mr. Milton Keating. Lawton. came here in the interest of promoting the Waurika Dam legislation. Thanks to my colleagues from Oklahoma. and to Mr. ROGEss. and to several other Members of this House. they have gone home in much higher spirits than when they arrived. Colleagues. I wish to relate to you the story of an elderly colored lady in Waurika. She. in recent weeks like nearly 400 others. has had her home ravaged and her garden destroyed. This poor lady probably never had much opportunity for formal education. She is a pensioner. It is all she can do to make her financial ends meet. Can you not just imagine how she feels with her possessions gone and no real means of repairing the damage? None of us would like to have our homes ransacked and our lives and the lives of our families endangered. Thus. I feel that we have only one choice in the case of the Waurika project. We must pass it. Our Government has oftentimes been called a government with a heart. I can only hope and pray that this concern for the general welfare be extended to cover these people affected by near annual floods. Before concluding. I wish to recognize three fellow Oklahomans who are the ones who have done the fieldwork for this project. They are Mr. Mark Barclay. regional director for the Bureau of Reclamation. Mr. Frank Rabb. executive director of the Oklahoma Water Resources Board. and Mr. Ira Husky. chief engineer for the Oklahoma Park Board. Mr. Speaker. I have continued a prolonged daily speechmaking exercise before this House. I have tried to bring the truth to the Members of this House. I will continue to seek passage of this legislation. I wish to conclude by asking each one here. ""What would you write to answer this poor lady who has lost her belongings and her garden?

I rise to address an issue of paramount and longterm importance to California and the nationOfficial English legislation. Nothing unites a people as effectively as a common language. it is especially important when members of society. often immigrants. do not necessarily share a common heritage. The common ground which language provides has led many nations to declare an official language: The fact that America does not have an official language makes us unique among -the worlds leading nations. At the same time. the United States does have a common language. English. This dichotomy results in todays Americans being subjected to a barrage of language issues. For California. bilingual education is immensely important There are 1 1h million California school children whose primary language is not English. These children need to be equipped with the absolutely essential skill of English fluency while they are at a young age and are more naturally able to learn language. It is important that the education program functions efficiently and successfully to fully integrate nonEnglish speaking children into an Englishspeaking society as quickly as possible. Without this basic skill. these children will most likely remain outside mainstream society. politics. and the economy. The bilingual education policy began in the 1970s with good intentions but has become a failure. Only 6.7% of limited English students going to school in California have been mainstreamed into English Only classrooms. California voters passed Proposition 227 last June by an overwhelming % of the vote. Proposition 227 replaces the current system that allows a slow phasing in of English into one where the curriculum supports a faster oneyear English immersion program. Such a program is designed to teach children English as quickly as possible in order to help them open doors of opportunity and reach their full potential in an English speaking society. Besides failing students. the bilingual education program is also costly. The California Department of Education reports that limited English proficiency programs received nearly $3 million in special funding. over and above the base funding amount of $5.000 per student in 1997. The same amount of public funds could have paid a years tuition at UCLA for almost one thousand studentsl With similar goals to fundamentally reform bilingual education programs on a federal level. H.R. 3892 is expected to be considered by the House this fall. This bill. known as the English Language Fluency Act. would give parents the authority to refuse enrollment or remove their child from a bilingual education program. give states. municipalities. and schools the power to create individualized English language instruction programs specific to community needs. and create accountability measures to ensure federal funding is given only to programs which are effective in teaching English to children. By these measures. H.R. 3892 hopes to reform a failing bilingual education program. Bilingual Education has failed those it was intended to help. It has been costly to taxpayers. has hurt those children who want to be fully prepared to take part in Americas economy. and has forced us to lower our standards in education. Official English legislation would provide a means to deal with these and other English issues. More importantly. establishing English as the official language of the United States sends a powerful message to all Americans and those wishing to become American citizens. Designating English as the nations language makes it clear that proficiency in this common language is absolutely critical for those who wish to fully participate in Americas unlimited economic and social opportunities. I believe this legislation may go a long way in helping us achieve these goals.\n',rise address issue paramount longterm importance nationofficial english legislation unite people common language important member society immigrant share common heritage common ground language provide lead many nation declare official language fact official language make unique world lead nation same time common language dichotomy result today subject barrage language issue bilingual_education important school child primary language english child need equip essential skill english_fluency young age able learn language important education program function integrate nonenglish_speak child englishspeake society possible basic skill child remain mainstream society politic economy bilingual_education policy begin 1970 good intention become failure limited english student go school mainstreame_classroom voter pass last overwhelming vote proposition replace current system allow slow phasing curriculum support fast oneyear english_immersion program program design teach child possible order help open_door opportunity reach full potential english_speaking society fail student bilingual_education program costly report limit english_proficiency program receive special funding base funding amount student same amount public fund pay year tuition studentsl similar goal reform bilingual_education program federal level expect consider fall bill know give parent authority refuse enrollment remove child bilingual_education program give state municipality school power create individualized english_language instruction program specific community need create accountability measure ensure federal funding give program effective teach child measure hope reform fail bilingual_education program fail intend help costly taxpayer hurt child want prepared take part economy force lower standard education official legislation provide means deal other english issue establish official language send powerful message wish become american citizen designate nation language make clear proficiency common language critical wish participate unlimited economic social opportunity believe legislation go long way help achieve_goals.\n,105.0,daily,1,0

(Mrs. RouKEMA). and the gentleman from Virginia for their outstanding leadership in getting this bill to the floor. For 25 years. we have been working on this effort. Today we are on the verge of making it a reality. For the first time in history. we are going to require a financial institution to actually have a privacy policy and to put it in plain English. Madam Speaker. for years. we have been hearing about the trend of global markets. Today globalization is the reality. Geographic borders no longer block the flow of capital. creating a whole new world of economic opportunity. The question is: Are we poised. are we prepared to take advantage of this opportunity? Are we willing to embrace the future? That is the question that is posed today. That is what the Financial Services Modernization Act is designed to do. Madam Speaker. rather. this bill will remove the red tape that threatens to strangle our financial institutions as they enter the new global marketplace. Americans believe deeply in competition. They trust the free market. Why? Because. year after year. competition brings more services. more choice. lower prices. and more wealth. Many financial conglomerates are already responding to their customers needs. offering a full menu of financial products and services. But that does not mean that. when GlassSteagall barriers are torn down. every bank will be a broker or that every broker will be an insurer. Customers will gravitate to the best managed. lowest price financial services provider. This legislation will give American companies the freedom that they need to meet this challenge. It will give the freedom to remain the world leading financial institution. Madam Speaker. while I support this legislation strongly. I must point out that it falls short in one important area. It does not provide for a full twoway street for the securities industry to engage in banking and socalled woofie provision. Woofies would have allowed firms with institutional and corporate clients to provide those customers with a full range of financial services without any additional risk to the Federal Deposit Insurance System. I am disappointed they were cut out of the conference report at the last second. Nevertheless. Madam Speaker. I strongly support this bill. It will encourage competition in the financial services industry both here and abroad. It will spur the creation of new financial instruments and new markets to the benefit of consumers and businesses alike. With that. I want to urge all of my colleagues to vote for this bill.

I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3732 a bill that will enable us to take care of our own by using savings in the military budget to increase support for domestic priorities and deficit reduction. Even as the threat of attack from abroad has receded. our domestic problems have grown dramatically worse. It is time to invest in America: we need to rebuild our infrastructure. to provide first rate educations for our children. to make capital available for our entrepreneurs. to create good jobs at decent wages. especially for dislocated workers. to protect our precious natural resources. and to make health care universally available. The accomplishment of these goals is -within our reach. By taking down the budget walls. we will enable the Appropriations Committees to follow budget plan A. That means more funds for deficit reduction. more funds for student loans. more funds for Head Start. more funds for mass transit. more funds for WIC. more funds for childhood immunizationsin short. more money to address a wide range of pressing needs. We can no longer afford to delay these investments. It is time for us to reorder our spending priorities. It is time for us to take care of our own. And as we do this. we should not fear for our allies in Europe and Japan. For 40 years. we have been picking up their military bills. To underscore the urgency of this situation. let me cite some of the sobering statistics from my home State of California. From the beginning of the recession in July 1990 to the end of 1991. unemployment rose in California from 5.3 to 7.7 percentputting more than 327.000 Californians out of work during this period. Over 1.1 million people are out of work in California. From 1990 to 1991. food stamp enrollment in California increased by over 20 percent. Six million Californians are without health insurance. Children account for nearly onethird of Californias uninsured. More than half of Californias 2yearolds do not have the full range of childhood immunizations. California has almost 6.000 bridges that have been determined to be structurally deficient or functionally obsolete. Over 60 percent of Californias paved rural highway miles need rehabilitation. if not outright reconstruction. California has 52 Superfund sites and 46 proposed sites. ranking it second in the Nation.\n',rise today strong support bill enable take care own use saving military budget increase support domestic priority deficit reduction threat attack recede domestic problem grow bad time invest need rebuild_infrastructure provide first rate education child make capital available entrepreneur create good job decent wage dislocated_worker protect precious natural_resource make health_care available accomplishment goal -within reach take budget wall enable follow budget plan a. mean more fund deficit reduction more fund student loan more fund more fund mass_transit more fund more fund childhood immunizationsin short more money address wide_range press need afford delay investment time reorder spending priority time take care own fear ally year pick military bill underscore_urgency situation let cite sober statistic home beginning recession end unemployment rise percentputte more work period people work food_stamp enrollment increase percent health insurance child account onethird uninsured more half full range childhood_immunization bridge determine deficient_obsolete percent pave rural highway mile need rehabilitation outright reconstruction site propose site rank nation.\n,102.0,daily,0,1

It is designed to achieve an essential. nationwide objective of great concern to all Americans. It is simple. specific. and to the point. It will. when enacted. provide a firm and sound base upon which plans and programs at all levels of government. and by private interests as well. may contribute realistically and comprehensively to the future of Americas great outdoor recreation heritage Our Nation has been blessed with a wealth of natural resources. enough to take care of the needs of every citizen. In fact. historically there has been a surplus permitting us to use these resources for purposes other than just to provide food. clothing. shelter. and all the elements going to make up our economic stability and strength. Our natural resources have underwritten and made possible the social. spiritual and other intangible values which have made our culture unique and which in the last analysis will provide the great bulwark against the forces which would destroy the free peoples of the world. Looming large in this aspect of the American character is our love for the outdoors and for outdoor recreation activity. We come by it naturally. The outdoors was the basic fact of life which faced our ancestors as they colonized the eastern seaboard. It was the basic fact of life for the pioneers as they moved civilization westward across the continent. For most Americans. until very recent years. outdoor experience was an integral part of our daily lives. on the farms and prairies. in the forests and mountains. on the lakes and streams and out into the blue waters of our oceans. Who would deny that life in the outdoors. for three centuries. has given Americans a toughness of body. vigor of mind. wholesome attitudes. initiative. resourcefulness. perspective and selfreliance. Outdoor living and outdoor experience is a cherished heritage. which we as a Nation must preserve for future generations of Americans. It will be essential to their physical and mental wellbeing as it has been to ours. Blessed with an abundance of resources. we have tended to consider them inexhaustiblewe took them for grantedwe assumed they would always be in abundance. We were lavish and prodigal. We know better now. and over the past half century important progress has been made in the conservation of our basic resource wealthsoil. water. forests and wildlife. This change of attitude did not just happen. Clearheaded leaders and thinkers saw the handwriting on the wallthey studied the facts. they evaluated the trends. they made their data available to the public. Public opinion was quick to insist that conservation of natural resources be accepted as basic national policy. We have long recognized outdoor recreation opportunity for all the people as basic national policy. It has been so recognized likewise by the States and Territories. Our great national park system was established with this objective in mind. Park systems. in the States were established for the same purposes. The national forests and the State forests have been administered with public recreation as a purpose. The programs of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and those of the State game. fih and conservation commissions similarly have been established and administered with the objective of preserving wildlife resources and the recreation they provide not only for sportsmen but for the great mass of the public who enjoy wildlife for itself. None of us have recognized fully. however. that the opportunities for wholesome outdoor recreation have been diminishing and that in the face of an everincreasing demand. Hence. our planning and programing have been inadequate. piecemeal and uncoordinated. It is interesting and encouraging that the National Park Service. the Forest Service. the Fish and Wildlife Service. the Bureau of Land Management. independently have recognized this situation and have undertaken longrange programs. Mission 66. Operations Outdoors for example. in an effort to match recreation facilities with recreation demand. But these programs. splendid as they are. will not be enough. The resources upon which recreation is based are diminishing primarily due to our burgeoning population. expanding communities. industrialization. airports. highways. and all the other attributes of our system which occupy space previously useful for recreation. The trend continues at an alarming rate. It has been pointed out that in 1776. when we declared our independence. there were some 600 acres of land. water and resources for each citizen of that day. Today. with a population of 173 million. the individual share has been reduced to 13 acres. In 1976 when we celebrate our bicentennial. the individual share will have been reduced to 10 acres. and by the year 2.000. to 8 acres or less. Eight acres from which to obtain all our necessities and luxuries and on which we shall also be dependent for outdoor recreation opportunity. The increase in demand. however. does not stem only from the population factor. Higher standards of living. increased leisure. improved transportation facilities. more frequent need for relaxation to counteract the stresses and strains of complex modernday living. adds year by year to the pressures on inadequate recreation resources. Not only are more people participating in a wider variety of outdoor recreation pursuits. they are spending more time participating in such activitiesabout twice as much time just in the past decade. For example. recreation use of the national forests increased from 6 million visits in 1926 to 53 million visits in 1956. The Park Service recorded 22 million visitors in 1946 and in excess of 59 million in 1957. Visitors to Army Engineer projects increased from 16 million in 1950 to some 80 million in 1957. In the State park systems we find the same trendan increase from 92 million visits in 1946 to over 215 million in 1957. Recreation visits to the TVA lakes jumped from 10 million to 40 million annually in the past 10 years. The story at our western reclamation reservoirs is no different. A hunting and fishing survey made by the Fish and Wildlife Service in 1955 showed that of 118 million individuals aged 12 or over in the United States. 25 million hunt. fish. or engage in both sports. The survey found also that they spent $3 billion annually in the pursuit of hunting and fishing recreation. It is estimated the annual total mandays spent hunting and fishing will double in the next 12 years. The National Association of Engine and Boat Manufacturers tell us that pleasure boats have increased from 2/2 million in 1947 to nearly 6 million in 1956. with more than 28 million persons having participated in recreational boating in 1956 and spending $114 billion in the process. It is reported that 66 million people now seek outdoor recreation in bird watching. wildlife photography. and other forms of nature study. Wildlife refuges. far too inadequate in number. size. and location. are hosts to over 7 million visitors per year with the increase gage at 71V2 percent per year. Incidentally. there has yet been made no substantial program for handling the vast crowds of interested citizens visiting our Federal refuges for recreation purposes. The increase is ever upward and in every phase of outdoor recreation. In studying this problem the committee noted that the expanding population and economy will continue to deplete the Nations outdoor recreation resources and opportunities unless measures are taken to preserve and improve those which remain and where practical to salvage. rehabilitate. and thereafter protect such land and water areas as may provide the additional outdoor recreation required for the future. It is imperative that the outdoor recreation resources of the United States be accorded the same recognition and consideration as all other resources which are essential to the economic and social welfare of the Nation. Outdoor recreation resource use and development must be evaluated and carefully planned on a longrange basis. We can no longer afford the extravagance of the piecemeal planning and indifference which has prevailed in the past. A nationwide inventory and evaluation of the Nations outdoor recreation resources and opportunities is a prerequisite to the sound planning of longrange programs. The legislation now before this body will create the facility and the means for making. on a nationwide. regionbyregion. StatebyState basis. such an inventory and evaluation of our remaining outdoor recreation resources. It will provide the means for full study of the trends in order that reliable forecasts may be made as to what our future requirements will be. Stating this in the simplest possible way: If we know what we have now. and if we know what we shall need in the future. then we can intelligently and realistically plan and undertake programs to assure that future needs will be met. S. 846. to create a temporary bipartisan study commission. has that single purpose and objective. Now. specifically. what does this legislation propose? First. it would authorize and create a bipartisan Outdoor Recreation Resources Review Commission. The Commission would be composed of 15 members including 2 majority and 2 minority members each of the Senate and House Interior Committees. and 7 citizens appointed by the President of the United States. Secondly. it establishes an advisory council consisting of a liaison officer from each of the Federal agencies concerned with outdoor recreation resources and opportunities plus 25 members appointed by the Commission representative of the various major geographical areas and citizen interest groups. including State and municipal agencies. commercial interests. labor. private organizations. and others interested and concerned in development of resources and recreation opportunity. Thirdly. it directs the Commission to make the comprehensive study. compile its data together with its recomniendations in a report to be presented to the President and Congress by September 1. 1961. The report shall be presented In such form as to be of maximum value not only to Congress and the executive departments but to the individual States as well. Fourthly. it authorizes the appropriation of not to exceed $2.500.000 to cover all costs of the Commission during the 3year study.\n',year body recall piece conservation legislation noncontroversial

I will vote against the Base Closure Commission list. I do so out of loyalty to the fine men and women of the Charleston Naval Station and Shipyard. And I do so for reasons of common sense and coat effectiveness. Let me first emphasize the special qualities of the work foree at Charleston Naval Complex. Time and again. these men and women have been cited for their superior producttvity. competitiveness. and dedication to duty. The fact is. it took a willful act of denial for the Base Realignment and Closure Commission to ignore the unique qualities of Charlestons work force. Last June. when the BRAC Commlssion visited Charleston. they witnessed the destroyer OBannon being refurbished in drydock at the Navy Yarda project that was subsequently finished $21 million under budget and months ahead of schedule. The Commission witnessed work teams from Pearl Harbor. Norfolk. Portsmouth. and Mare Island who were visiting the Charleston yard for the express purpose of studying the superior teamwork aend methods employed an the O&annon project. Likewise. the BRAC Commlssion was fully aware of the extraordinarily distinguished record of the Charleston Shipyard stretching back nearly a century. In recent years. Charleston has been recognized with Presidential citations. Navy E Awards for excellence. and other top honors. Repeatedly. the Charleston Navy Ship Yard has won contracts in competition with private shipyards. This is a record of excellence that stretches back decades. For example. after World War HI. the West German Government insisted that Charleston do the repair and rehabilitation work on ships destined to the Federal Republic under Lend Lease. So the Navy Is closing down its very best. In this case. the Navys motto should be ""no good deed goes unpunished."" Mr. President. quite aside from the issue of loyalty and good faith to the outstanding people in the Charleston Navy work force. there is the collateral issue of the waste involved in shutting down Charleston at the same time the Navy plans to spend hundreds of millions expanding bases at Pascagoula. Ingleside. and Everett to accomplish the same mission. Bear In mind. In the case of Charleston Naval Station. we have a mature. upandrunning base that is fully equipped with the most modern facilities and equipment. In contrast. the bases at Pascagoula. Ingleside. and Everett are barebones facilities that will require huge Investments if they are to aspire to Charlestons stature. Given the practical demands of keeping a volunteer Navy happy. each of these facilities will have to be equipped with commissaries. PXs. clinics. snack bars. recreation facilities. day care centers. bachelor officer quarters. and so on. Today. Ingleside will require $41 million to build small boat piers and a degaussing station. Charleston Naval Station already has these facilities. but Charleston is to be closed. Today. Everett Naval Station requires millions to build a commissary and child care center. Charleston already has these facilities. but Charleston is to be closed. In the name of saving taxpayer dollars. the BRAG Commission opted to close the timetested. fully equipped Charleston Naval Station and to spend hundreds of millions expanding Pascagoula. Ingleside. and Everett. This simply defies rational analysis. and can only be explained by a distorted and biased baseclosure process. On that score. I place no small measure of blame on the incestuous nature of the BRAG proceedings. The Navy assigned personnel to staff the BRAG Commission. Those uniformed staff members were not there to do an objective job. they were there to justify the Navys predetermined choices. For example. Naval staff officers attempted to justify moving the Mine Warfare Center from Charleston to Ingleside partly on the grounds that Corpus Christi Air Station is close to the Texas naval facility. they failed to note that Charleston Air Force Basehome to the C17 Globemasteris even closer to the existing Mine Warfare Center in Charleston. Mr. President. It is not in the best interest of the Navy to lose Its best equipped. best staffed facility. And it is not in the interest of taxpayers for us to sanction the tremendous waste involved In closing Charleston at the same time we are building up three other naval bases with a directly comparable mission. The list drawn up by the BRAG Commission is grossly flawed with regard to Charleston. I will vote against it.\n'",vote list loyalty fine man woman reason common_sense coat effectiveness let emphasize special quality work foree time man woman cite superior producttvity competitiveness dedication duty fact take willful act denial ignore unique quality work force last brac visit witness destroyer refurbish drydock project finish budget month schedule witness work team visit yard express purpose study superior teamwork aend method employ project brac aware distinguished record stretch century recent year recognize presidential citation excellence other top honor win contract competition private shipyard record excellence stretch decade example west_german insist repair rehabilitation work ship destine close good case motto good deed go unpunished issue loyalty good faith outstanding people work force collateral issue waste involve shut same time plan spend hundred_million expand basis_ingleside accomplish same mission mind case mature_upandrunne base equip modern facility equipment contrast basis_ingleside barebone facility require huge investment aspire_charleston stature give practical demand keep volunteer happy facility equip commissary_px clinic snack_bar recreation facility day care center bachelor officer quarter today require build small boat pier_degaussing station facility close today require million build commissary child care center facility close name save taxpayer dollar opt close timeteste equip spend hundred_million expand ingleside_defy rational analysis explain distorted_biased baseclosure_process score place small measure blame incestuous nature brag proceeding assign personnel staff uniformed staff member objective job justify predetermine choice example naval staff officer attempt justify move ground close naval facility fail note exist good interest lose good equipped staff facility interest taxpayer sanction tremendous waste involve close same time build other naval basis comparable mission list draw flawed regard vote it.\n,103.0,daily,0,1
800136193,S,19480209,162,Mr. AIKEN,Unknown,AIKEN,Unknown,M,4535,4987,02091948.txt,16252,1010,80100361,AIKEN,GEORGE,S,VT,M,R,,voting,Mr. President. I shall now discuss the St. Lawrence seaway. Probably it would be superfluous to state the great. impelling reasons why the project should be completed without delay. Nevertheless. I should like to refresh the memory of my colleagues who are present. while they are present. in one respect. I think it is a wellknown fact that there is a great shortage of power in the United States today. not only in the Northeast. where the St. Lawrence power would be generally used. but also on the Pacific coast we hear of brownouts. we read of plants closing down in the Mississippi Valley because of shortage of power. and this shortage is growing more acute almost by the hour. At the end of the war. at the height of the use of power for war purposes. as a nation we were using at the rate of 240.000.000.000 kilowatthours annually. On the first of this year we were using at the rate of 300.000.000.000 kilowatthours annually. showing an increase of 25 percent in the use of power since VJday. St. Lawrence power is the largest single block of undeveloped power available in North America today. As has been stated. the total development would amount to 2.200.000 horsepower. which is so firm that it would produce 13.200.000.000 kilowatthours annually. according to our engineers. Half of this power would belong to Canada. half to the United States. The half that would belong to the United States would be turned over to the State of New York when an agreement has been reached between the Federal Government and the State of New York relating to the distribution of the St. Lawrence power. Such agreement. under the pending joint resolution. would have to protect the rights of the United States and of the several States within economic transmission distances of the proposed power station at Massena. N. Y. I should now like to show the desperate need of the northeastern part of our country for power. I have already cited instances of how in Vermont plants have had to close during the day and could operate only at night. how we were asked not to use colored lights on the Christmas trees for the children. how a private power company had shut off over 2.000 members of the Washington REA in Vermont. forcing them to rely for power on inadequate Diesel equipment at high cost. I have learned recently that the REA has been able to carry the load. At first the power company asked them to take over the load under a penalty clause in the contract which was signed with them. from 8 a. m. to 4 p. m. The REA had no difficulty in carrying the load during those hours of the day. Then the power company told them that under the terms of the contract they would have to assume the load from 3 p. m. until 11 p. in.. which is the time of day when the peak of farm use is highest and when the use for industry usually starts to taper off. The REA has been able to carry this load up to the present time. as I stated. It is costing the REA 3 cents or possibly as high as 4 cents per kilowatthour to generate that power for those 2.000 farms up there. I cannot help but feel that the power company is taking advantage of the present situation to discredit the REA as an organization. I am advised by the REA locally that It is not only shortage of power that is bothering them today but it is shortage of materials needed for line construction. Until recently it was thought that steel was the bottleneck. Now it develops that aluminum for making conductors is the bottleneck. The reason for this is that the aluminum manufacturers are short of power. Last summer the aluminum manufacturers in the TVA area released some TVA power and relied on their own power. Now the aluminum company is so short of power that it cannot maintain its production schedule. So the evidence continues to pile up to show that private industry cannot supply the power that is needed In these United States of ours. and. moreover. has been shortsighted in this power program. One might think that the power shortage would be alleviated by the large number of storms which we have had this winter. by the large amount of snow which has fallen. Snow melts and produces water even in the coldest weather. because it melts near the ground. We expect that when the spring floods come we will have power enough in the Northeast for 3 or 4 months. But let me again remind the Senate of what the situation is today in my own State of Vermont. I have before me clippings from newspapers which I received last Saturday. The newspapers were printed on different days last week. but I received them all on Saturday. I should like to read some headings for the record. I read a heading from the St. Johnsbury CaledonianRecord: New power crisis puts water plants back on night work. They cannot operate days because there is not power enough. I read from the St. Albans Messenger of February 5. 1948: Area power crisis closes six industries. Grain. carbon plants. Rubberoid. Fonda. C. V. Shops. Missisquoi hit. The article says: Six industries in St. Albans and all sawmills in the county have been forced to curtail operations or shut down completely because of the critical power shortage. A. W. Peterson. superintendent of the Public Electric Light Co.. has announced. Sawmills that would be getting out building materials with which to build more homes for people in the United States are having to shut down. The article continues: The industries of the city most affected by the curtailment or the order were St. Albans Grain Co.. shut down yesterdayThat is owned by the Corn Products Corp.National Carbon and Fonda Container. shut down today. Rubberoid. Saturday and Sunday. Central Vermont Railroad Shops. Friday. and Missisquol Corp.. Monday. In addition to not receiving any power on these days the six industries will not receive any power over the week end. Saturday and Sunday. Two sawmills and the talc mine at Johnson served by Public Electric suspended operations this morning and no date was given when operations would be resumed. These six large plants. and all those sawmills that are shut down are located not so far from the site of the proposed development on the St. Lawrence River. I read from the St. Johnsbury Caledonian of January 31. 1948. The heading is as follows: Generators may lose oil for power making. The people up there. in an effort to keep their small industries in operation. have acquired very small. antiquated and obsolete Diesel plants wherever they can find them in the United States. some of them being shipped in from distances up to 1.000 miles or more. They produce highcost power at best. And the worst of it Is that they cannot get oil with which to operate. Some 800.000 gallons of oil have been borrowed from the Navy. It must be returned this spring. I read from the Newport Express of January 30. 1948. The heading is as follows: Power situation reported blacker. Burlington plant faces complete shutdown because of lack of oil. Connecting utilities are unable to supply power for Newport lines. I have here the Montpelier Evening Argus: Electric generation in northern Vermont down. That is all the article says. They represent the voice of the power companies and usually go easy on them. Mr. President. that is the situation we are in today. I cannot understand how people in other parts of this country of ours whom we have helped to obtain power for their own industries. for their own homes and their own farms. can take the position which some of them do in opposing the development of power for us up in the Northeast. The power companies are making a very unwise. desperate. and costly effort partially to meet the need. They are seeking to put dams across our rivers. flooding the best class I land we have in New England. In one case they propose to destroy over 5.000 acres of class I land to generate 14 million kilowatthours of power annually. We have reached the point. Mr. President. where we cannot afford to destroy some of the highest rated land in the United States and make highcost power. and let billions of kilowatthours run down the St. Lawrence River idly and be wasted. The reason for this tremendous increase in the use of power is probably known to every Member of the Senate. We have become a Nation of electrified industries. We have built up great chemical industries which use enormous amounts of power. We have built up steel and magnesium and aluminum industries. Aluminum and magnesium must have huge amounts of powerI believe 7 kilowatthours to every pound of aluminum. The steel industry has become so electrified that it is the second largest user in the United States today. Further than that. our factories which wish to continue doing business in a competitive world have to electrify. During the war they could continue on an inefficient basis. but that time is over. They will have to become efficient or go out of business. Our homes have become electrified. It is true that if the housewife were to do away with her washing machine. her refrigerator. her electric sewing machine. electric fans. and all those things which make life worth living. a huge amount of power could be saved. Our farms need more and more power to run the ensilage cutters. to saw the wood. to operate the milkers and the milk coolers. We are obliged to cool our milk before 9 oclock in the morning now. under the board of health rules of Boston and New York. The milk cannot be cooled with ice. It is necessary to use electric coolers. The many freezers installed on the farms and in communities use a great amount of electricity. and save huge amounts of food for our country and for the world. I could go on and on enumerating the things that electricity is used for now that it was not used for a few years ago. It has become a vital necessity in our agricultural. domestic. industrial. and professional life. We need the St. Lawrence seaway for purposes of navigation. I have sat in this Chamber during the debate on this subject and have heard opponents of the seaway argue against it because the project called. for only a 27foot depth in the channel. Why do they argue for huge amounts to be spent on the lower Mississippi on a 12foot channel? I cannot understand it. I am for navigation in all parts of the country. but the opponents are not consistent when they say that a 27foot channel on the St. Lawrence will not be adequate. and at the same time say that we must finish a 12foot channel in the Mississippi so that grain may be moved down the river. I am for Mississippi River navigation. with two reservations: First. that the MississippiMissouri system must not be developed and controlled so as to yield profit to only a few individuals. It should be developed for all the people. Secondly. I believe that the great agricultural regions of Montana. the Dakotas. Wyoming. Colorado. Nebraska. and other States should have first call on the water for their crops. What is left may well be used for power and for navigation. I am afraidin fact. I knowthat the opposition centered in the immensely wealthy city of New York and vicinity is attempting the old tactics of divide and conquer. when they spread the news all over the Missouri Basin that that system cannot be developed if the St. Lawrence seaway goes through. that we cannot afford to develop both projects. They know better than that. They know that the St. Lawrence development is a self -liquidating development. that it will pay for itself. and is required to pay for itself. whereas we must make direct appropriationsand up to this time have been glad to do scfor the construction of dams in the MississippiMissouri Valley Basin. I should like to say to my friends in the Missouri Valley Basin that those people in New York are simply trying to divide us and put us in the Northeast in the position where we will vote against developments for the Northwest. It is the old divideandconquer tactics. The New York opposition is just as much against developing the Missouri Valley Basin for the benefit of the people as it is against developing the St. Lawrence River for the benefit of the people. The fight we are having on the St. Lawrence is not merely a fight for the people of Minnesota. Wisconsin. Michigan. New England. and New York. It is a fight which concerns every part of the country. It is a fight which particularly concerns the Tennessee Valley Authority. the Southwest Power Authority. and the people of the Northwest. because just as sure as the opposition can get the St. Lawrence development down where it wants it. the opposition will proceed with the same tactics against the Tennessee Valley Authority. the REA. and public power wherever it may be found. We need the St. Lawrence seaway for national security reasons. That has been told us by those who are in the best position to knowGeneral Marshall. General Eisenhower. Admiral Nimitz. and Admiral Leahy. the Joint Chiefs of Staff of a year ago. They know better than do retired generals and admirals what this country needs in the way of security today. Speaking of security. we need a strong Canada. Why is it that those who voted to spend half a billion dollars in Greece and Turkey. a long way from home. oppose spending that amount or less to develop the St. Lawrence? They are not consistent. I have sat in this Chamber during the past 2 weeks and have heard several Senators give what they seemed to think were adequate reasons for not authorizing the construction of the Great LakesSt. Lawrence seaway. In my opinion. none of the arguments which have been advanced by the opposition is valid in the slightest degree. The arguments have all closely followed the minority views of certain members of the Committee on Foreign Relations. Nine members of the Committee on Foreign Relations voted last summer to report the joint resolution favorably. They had heard. over the past 2 years. the proponents and opponents of this development present their cases. and after they had listened to the presentations for and against the seaway. they voted 9 to 4 to recommend its approval. The committee agreed then not to report it officially to the Senate. however. until the beginning of the second session of the Eightieth Congress. in compliance with the request of the opposing members of the committee. so that they would have timemore than 5 months. in factto prepare a minority report. I may say at the outset that Ihis minority report is a masterful writing job. it shows a high degree of literary skill. and I would say that the members of the Foreign Relations Committee who are opposed to the pending legislation have presented the most favorable views they possibly could have presented for their side of the case. But. Mr. President. for all of the skill in phraseology. for all the masterful technique employed. for all the newlook this material may. in the eyes of the layman. appear to have. it is still by and large the same old story which we have heard for 20 years. There is one common theme that runs through this report. just as this theme has permeated the other reports in opposition to the St. Lawrence project. The underlying dominant theme still is delayand more delay. In all modesty. I may say that I have been intimately associated with the St. Lawrence project during the entire time I have been in Washington. In the course of these years I have had an opportunity to observe rather carefully the techniques. the methods. and procedures of those who have been and are the real opponents of the project. Without exception. they have all stressed this same theme of delay. For 20 years now. as soon as one study has been made the opposition has suggested that additional studies were needed. Let them present on the floor of the Senate some project in which the opponents of the seaway are interested. When asked about the details of the project. the chances are 100 to 1 that all of them will not know what they are. Additional study is just what the opposition members of the Senate Foreign Relations Commitee have recommended in the present case. I am convinced. Mr. President. that this is part and parcel of the philosophy of the railroads and the power companiesthe recognized leaders of the opposition to this project.\n',discuss seaway superfluous state

I want to take a moment to explain my support for the resolution of the Senator from Massachusetts. Senate Concurrent Resolution 89. This resolution expresses the sense of the Senate that the United States play a strong and active role at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development UNCED]. It directs our country to develop international agreements on a widerange of global environmental issues. while taking into account their effect on American jobs and competitiveness. Consistent with the old maxim theres no free lunch. environmental protection comes at a price. The United States and the world must take steps to mitigate the possibility of global climate change carefully calculated to produce the greatest environmental benefits with the least economic impact. We must focus our limited economic resources on addressing the most pressing environmental risks. not those which are unclear or remote. In particular. the United States must continue to take a cautious approach before committing to binding agreements on carbon dioxide stabilization. Given the scientific uncertainties and enormous costs in jobs and competitiveness that such targets and timetables could exact. the U.S. position is prudent. It reflects an understanding that our Nations energy mix is. in the near term. dependent on coalburning utilities. much more so than other developed nations. To commit ourselves to targets and timetables for carbon dioxide stabilization. without a complete understanding of the magnitude of its effect on global climate change. is a solution in search of a clearly defined problem. The United States has been harshly criticized for not committing to targets and timetables. However. the United States has proposed a plan for voluntary stabilization that would be revisited when more facts are known about global climate change. I am troubled by critics of the administration who insist we should shackle our economys energy use and.. determine later whether carbon dioxide emissions present substantial risks of potential climate change. I am also concerned that in this election year the U.S. position at this very important conference could be undermined by partisan politics back home. For these reasons. I amended Senator KERYs original resolution in the Foreign Relations Committee to clarify that the United States should not commit to any measures which would have an adverse impact on American industry. or result in a longterm loss of American jobs. Based on risk assessment. holding off on targets and timetables is the most reasonable approach to ensuring that the nations of the world are able to pool their limited resources to address the most pressing global environmental problems. Senator KERRYs resolution expresses the duality of the Earth summit. It is an enormous opportunity to come to grips with international environmental issues. But no one should delude themselves to think that the UNCED Conference will be Just about the environment. Its about geopolitics. Its about competitiveness. Its about money. The Kerry resolution recognizes these parameters in advocating an active role for the United States in addressing global environmental concerns in a reasonable. costeffective manner. In conclusion. I supported the resolution of the Senator from Massachusetts because the Earth summit will not take place in a political and economic vacuum. Senate Concurrent Resolution 89 reflects these realities.9\n',want take moment explain support resolution resolution express sense play strong active role direct country develop international agreement widerange global environmental issue take account effect american job competitiveness consistent old maxim s free lunch environmental protection come price world take step mitigate possibility global_climate change calculate produce great environmental benefit least economic impact focus limited economic resource address pressing environmental risk unclear remote particular continue take cautious approach commit bind agreement carbon_dioxide stabilization give scientific uncertainty enormous cost job competitiveness such target timetable exact position prudent reflect understanding energy mix near term dependent coalburne_utility other developed nation commit target timetable carbon_dioxide stabilization complete understanding magnitude effect global_climate change solution search define problem criticize commit target timetable propose plan voluntary stabilization revisit more fact know global_climate change trouble critic administration insist shackle energy use determine carbon_dioxide emission present substantial risk potential climate_change concerned election year position important conference undermine partisan_politic reason amend original resolution clarify commit measure adverse_impact american industry result longterm loss american job base risk assessment hold target timetable reasonable approach ensure nation world able pool limited resource address press global environmental problem resolution express duality summit enormous opportunity come grip international environmental issue one delude think environment geopolitic competitiveness money resolution recognize parameter advocate active role address global environmental concern reasonable costeffective_manner conclusion support resolution summit take place political economic vacuum reflect realities.9\n,102.0,daily,1,0

I think my good friend from Kentucky has asked a question that all of us wish we had the full answer to. But I think there are certain portions of the answer that we can isolate. I think we do see what the longrange solution is and it is to bring Federal spending under control. It is to live within our means and that will certainly help. but it is not the full answer. as the Senator from Kentucky has said. That alone will not by itself control inflation nor will it restore health to the economy. Along with it. we need some changes in our tax laws that will encourage savings. I think we need further tax exemption for interest on savings in amounts that go far beyond the $200 exemption that we passed this year. which was a good first time. Certainly we need to 33500 tLu speed depreciation ratios to encourage investment. I say to my friend from Kentucky I think if we do not find a way to look after the interest rate situation in the meantime we can well drive this economy over the brink in the short run. We could well bring on economic panic. We could bring on severe trouble for our financial institutions. I honestly think that last spring when the interest rates were so high we were probably within 30 days of a complete break in our economy. I think we are approaching that same kind of situation now. We also have a number of international loans in the less developed countries by major financial institutions that are not all that secure. Either one of those two factors could lead to an economic panic in this country. and I urge the new administration to immediately develop an emergency plan to deal with it. I have my own pet idea for how we could bring down the interest rates. I think we should try to target an interest rate reduction for the purposes that are really needed to keep the economy going. and my proposal would be that we allow banks and savings and loans and other institutions to offer taxfree savings accounts. in essence up to maybe as much as $25.000.\n',think good friend ask question wish full answer think certain portion answer isolate think see longrange solution bring federal spending control live mean help full answer say control inflation restore health economy need change tax law encourage saving think need further tax exemption interest saving amount go exemption pass year good first time need tlu speed depreciation ratio encourage investment say friend think find way look interest rate situation meantime drive economy brink short run bring economic panic bring severe trouble financial institution think last spring interest rate high day complete break economy think approach same kind situation number international loan develop country major financial institution secure factor lead economic panic country urge new administration develop emergency plan deal own pet idea bring interest rate think try target interest rate reduction purpose need keep economy go proposal allow bank saving loan other institution offer saving account essence much,96.0,bound,0,1

This bill will provide the incentive to businessmen to train and upgrade the job skills of the unemployed and underemployed. The approach of the bill is constructive and workable. It is a commonsense approach. since it furnishes an employee with a most effective incentive to improve his skillsa good job with steady employment. While he is being trained. he knows that there is a job opening waiting for him and that it will be there when he completes training. Once an employee has been trained for a particular job skill. he does not have to stop at that level. but can continue to upgrade his skills and advance in responsibility and job satisfaction. Businessmen in the past have been of immeasurable help to the economy by providing onthejob training to the unskilled and the inexperienced. They have provided an important way in which the unskilled can and have become skilled. There are many instances where men who have their eye on the profitandloss column have taken individuals off the relief rolls and provide them with jobs and pride of accomplishment. Examples of businesses training individuals for jobs such as cabdrivers. typists. key punch operators. and service station attendants are numerous. It is my understanding that the private sector of our economy alone spends in excess of $4.5 billion annually on job training. The Federal Government is not. as yet. the sole provider of education and training. However. there are those who. as Mark Twain stated. ""think there is only one way to spell a word."" The success of the investment tax credit for investment in plant and equipment has proven a success. as has the ability of businessmen to get the most for the least. It is time we encourage the .proven. economical. and efficient manner of curing the problem of structural unemployment. by providing the tax credit in this bill.

During the past few weeks the Governor of our State has put out several statements in which he has indicated that it is necessary for a State to set up a lobbyist in Washington in order to secure Defense contracts because Wisconsin has slipped in the past 2 years from 2 percent of the total Defense contracting to 1 percent. Personally. as a member of this committee. I have never felt it was any of my business to get into this whole question of Defense contract awards other than to see that they were awarded competitively. He has indicated our congressional delegation has been derelict in its duty in not channeling more in the area of Defense contracts into our State. I am interested in finding out what you think is proper for a congressional group or congressional delegation to do? What should a congressional delegation do to see that awards are made to this company within a given State? If the bidding were on a comparable basis I can see where there might be some basis for a congressional delegation to move into this field. If there were two bids that were just the same and the award balanced on just that kind of basis I can understand active aggressive interest by our delegation. Many of these bids--they are on a competitive basis. are they not? Secretary McNAMARA. Most of the contracting is not done on a full competitive basis in the sense in which you use the term. as I outline on the charts in my prepared statement (p. 200 of these hearings). We are increasing very substantially the percentage of the contracting done on a competitive basis above that of prior years. and we expect to achieve major savings as a result. If I may answer the question. ""What do I believe to be the proper role of congressional representatives in relation to Defense contracting?"" I would say this: I believe it is quite appropriate for a Member of Congress or a group of Members of Congress to inquire as to why an award is to be made to one company instead of another company. I dont believe it would be appropriate for the Members of Congress to seek to change the award from company A to company B contrary to the intent of the law under which we procure. and the law is very clear. We are to procure from the lowest price source. other things being equal. subject to certain special situations. such as setasides for small business. and in certain cases labor surplus areas.

I thank the gentlewoman from Ohio for yielding me this time. Mr. Speaker. it is time to allow married couples to keep more of their money. The breakdown of the family has had a devastating effect on our society. Instead of having families stay together. our current Tax Code is forcing families apart. H.R. 6 is legislation that will lighten the tax burden once and for all on all married couples. It is time to shore up family life by allowing husbands and wives to keep more of what they earn. H.R. 6 will do just that. The marriage penalty not only punishes our most sacred institution. marriage. but it also indirectly hurts women. When the marriage penalty first appeared in the Tax Code in 1969. most families had one breadwinner and the tax provision was actually designed to give a tax cut. a socalled marriage bonus. to all of our oneincome families. The tax policy failed to envision the growing number of women that would eventually go into the workforce. Today. in nearly 75 percent of all families. both the husband and wife work outside the home. When two working spouses combine their income. the wages of the secondary earner are usually taxed at a higher marginal rate. Since it is often the wife who is the secondary earner in the family. the marriage penalty. in my view. creates an extremely unfair bias against them. The beauty of this legislation. Mr. Speaker. is that we do not penalize those families who choose to have one spouse stay at home with their families. H.R. 6 eliminates the homemaker penalty for families in which one spouse decides to work part time or not at all. In other words. Mr. Speaker. this legislation benefits all married couples. In my district. there will be 60.392 married couples who will benefit from this legislation. In the State of Alabama. 424.956 married couples will benefit from this legislation. Mr. Speaker.

If the Chair will look at the language of the amendment it first of all deals with appropriation bills. the work product of the Committee on Appropriations. and the powers and prerogatives of the Committee on Appropriations under the rules. If the Chair will consult both House Resolution 988 and House Resolution 1248 the Chair will find that there is a miscellaneous section there too. This amendment is directed at the miscellaneous section. I would inform the Chair that word ""miscellaneous"" means broad. diverse. and manyfold. I would point out that not only do the provisions of both the miscellaneous section and the rest of the bill deal not only specifically with rules X and XI. and with other portions of the rule not enumerated or named. but treated in a general fashion. but that the miscellaneous section deals with a large number of items within the rules of the House. More specifically. both of the resolutions deal with the powers and prerogatives of the Committee on Appropriations as well as the duties and the responsibilities. And so a section to be added relating to the powers and the prerogatives of the Committee on Appropriations would at least in my view. therefore. be fully appropriate and germane. because the function of the amendment as offered is to deal with the powers and prerogatives of the Committee on Appropriations and. Mr. Chairman. in contrast to what my good friend. the gentleman from Mississippi said. not just the powers of all the committees. but only the powers of the Committee on Appropriations since the amendment relates to the question of how appropriation bills shall be reported to the House. and the main rule is the one relating to the powers of the Committee on Appropriations in legislating. So I think it ought to be clearly ascertained that we put. through the proposed amendmentor the proposed amendment would putfurther restrictions on the powers of the Committee on Appropriations to legislate. I would address myself to that in the appropriate fashion when the Chair has disposed of the point of order. I note my good friend. the gentleman from Texas. Is standing. If the Chair would permit. I will yield to him for an appropriate comment.\n'",question body amendment germane question consider establish germaneness amendment amendment germane amendment resolution question germaneness relate particular rule address address fair reading entirety proposal proposal germane amendment moment gentleman great respect gentleman able valuable say particular amendment purport amend rule germane look language amendment deal appropriation bill work product power prerogative rule consult find miscellaneous section amendment direct miscellaneous section inform word miscellaneous mean broad diverse manyfold point provision miscellaneous section rest bill deal rule other portion rule enumerate name treat general fashion miscellaneous section deal large number item rule resolution deal power prerogative duty responsibility section add relate power prerogative least view appropriate germane function amendment offer deal power prerogative contrast good friend gentleman say power committee power amendment relate question appropriation bill report main rule relate power legislate think ascertain put propose amendmentor propose amendment putfurther restriction power legislate address appropriate fashion dispose point order note good friend gentleman stand permit yield appropriate comment.\n,93.0,bound,0,1

FRANK CHURCH. the senior Senator from Idaho and chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. FRANK is one of my very closest friends in and out of the Senate. We are family friends. too. and Bethine and he are a couple of whom my wife and I are very fond. Here I would add that Bethine has played a wonderful role as FRANKS partner. helpmate. campaign manager. and general supporter. We knew each other before either of us was elected to the Senate. and we have both shared a deep interest in the foregn policy and diplomacy of our Nation. FRANK CHURCH has had an outstanding career in public service and a long list of accomplishments to his credit. A champion debater in his youth. FRANK CHURCH is one of the most articulate. persuasive people ever to serve in the Senate. He was never content simply to take positions on issues. he advanced his positions and worked hard to develop the necessary support for important legislation. As evidence of my high regard and affection. I was proud and glad to be chairman of the Church for President Committee in 1976. While it was a shortlived campaign. it was almost successful. and we will all remember FRANKS brilliant speech at the 1976 Democratic Convention. FRANK CHURCH has been a fierce defender of and advocate for the interests of his State of Idaho. His constituents will particularly remember him for his leadership in the passage of the Wilderness Act of 1961 and the National Wild and Scenic Rivers Act of 1968. It was also through his efforts that the River of No Return Wilderness Area was established. and it is the largest such area in the lower 48 States. In the area of foreign relations. FRANK CHURCH followed in the illustrious footsteps of a fellow Idahoan. William E. Borah. as chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. Although FRANK did not have the opportunity to serve as chairman for as long as William Borah did. his chairmanship was a highly eventful and productive one. Under FRANK CHURCHS leadership. the Foreign Relations Committee authored the Taiwan Relations Act and was the principal center of debate of the SALT II treaty. The committees debate and deliberations were the most extensive and Instructive in the history of arms control. and Majority Leader ROBERT BYRD very aptly described the committees report on the treaty as the best and most thorough report he had seen in the Senate. Even before he became chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. FRANK CHURCH made his mark on American foreign policy through the CooperChurch amendment in 1970 denying funds to carry on hostilities in Cambodia. by his investigations of the activities of multinational corporations and the covert operations of the CIA. and for his leadership in navigating the Panama Canal treaties through the Senate. FRANK CHURCHS career in the Senate has ended long before it should have. but he has a rich and proud record to look back on. He exhibited great courage. foresight and legislative skill. and I and others of his colleagues will long remember and admire him. I hope that as a private citizen. he will continue to speak out and offer counsel on important issues. My wife. Nuala. and I are deeply and personally sad. and we join in extending to him and Bethine our love and all the best in their new life.*\n',personal sadness regret join bid_farewell distinguished accomplish body senior chairman close friend family friend couple wife fond add play wonderful role partner campaign manager general supporter know other elect share deep interest policy diplomacy nation outstanding career public service long list accomplishment credit champion debater youth articulate_persuasive people serve content take position issue advance position work develop necessary support important legislation evidence high regard affection proud glad chairman shortlive campaign successful remember brilliant speech fierce_defender advocate interest constituent remember leadership passage effort establish large such area low state area foreign relation follow illustrious footstep fellow chairman opportunity serve chairman chairmanship eventful productive leadership author principal center debate treaty committee debate deliberation extensive instructive history arm control describe committee report treaty good thorough report see become chairman make mark american foreign policy amendment deny fund carry hostility investigation activity multinational_corporation covert operation leadership navigate treaty career end rich proud record look exhibit great courage_foresight legislative skill other colleague remember admire hope private citizen continue speak offer counsel important issue wife sad join extend love good new life.*\n,96.0,bound,0,1

Last Friday night we were threatened with the complete paralysis of all the economic and industrial life of the Nation. At that time we felt a tenseness which now. fortunately. we do not feel. because the emergency which then existed has been resolved. The coal strike. which began prior to the railroad strike. likewise has now been resolved. The condition which confronted the country last Friday and Saturday. when the President of the United States spoke to the people and to the Congress. is not the situation which exists today. If any one of the 96 Members of this body had been President of the United States last Friday night. when the industrial life of the Nation was threatened with prostration. when people all over the land were demanding action. and when action had to be taken for the maintenance of law and order and to preserve the sovereignty of the Government. if any one of the Members of this body had then been in the Presidents position I do not know whetherhe could have done otherwise than the President felt he was called upon to do. Quick. hasty. crude. if you please. though the remedy might have been. he was called upon to act in the great emergency which then confronted us. Today. as we look back over it. it does not seem to have been quite so dangerous as we thought it was on last Friday and Saturday. I have been greatly impressed with the remarks just made by the distinguished majority leader. as I have been impressed with the remarks of the distinguished Senator from Colorado and the distinguished Senator from Ohio on the other side. There clearly is a great conflict in the thought of today. But there was not much conflict in the thought of last Friday and Saturday. because no sooner had the President of the United States acted than the House of Representatives. Democrats and Republicans alike. with almost unprecedented solidarity. by a vote of 306 to 13. supported the proposal of the President. because the need of that hour was for action. even though the action might not be perfectly poised or balanced or in complete accord with our traditions and our constitutional heritage. But today the situation has changed. although in the near future we may have another crisis from some unforeseen quarter. Therefore. as we look at it today and as we conside- the remarks of the majority leader. on the one hand. and the remarks of the distinguished Senators who have taken the opposition side. ipon the other. all of which arguments are worth our most careful consideration and are worthy of the deepest weight. now that we have a breathing spell. now that we have a chance to examine the pending bill a little more carefullyan opportunity which the House of Representatives did not have the other day when it acted upon itit seems to me that it would be the part of wisdom and the logical course for this great body. the greatest deliberative body in the world. to follow. to go slowly. not to strike down anything in toto. on the one hand. or to keep anything in toto. on the other hand. but with more deliberation to try to fashion a piece of legislation which. in the light of present circumstances. at 4:45 in the afternoon. after the coal strike has been settled. and after the railroad strike is behind us. will be worthy of our recollection in the light of past history. so recent in our minds. and of possible future history as it may unfold itself in the events of next week. Therefore. Mr. President. with that thought in mind. may I appeal to the Senate. to those who oppose this measure. and to those who favor it. and to those who are in between. who favor a more modified approach to it. not to act this afternoon. inasmuch as the coal strike has been settled. but to deliberate further on this matter. The Senate. I understand. will be in recess tomorrow. which is Thursday. and we can return on Friday with a uittle less passion and a little less heat and a little more mature reflection. and see whether we can take this measure and ashion it into something which may be worthy of the Congress of the United States.\n',seem impossible believe same country today exist last night last night threaten complete paralysis economic industrial life nation time feel tenseness feel emergency exist resolve coal strike begin railroad strike resolve condition confront country last speak people situation exist today member body last night industrial life nation threaten prostration people land demand action action take maintenance law order preserve sovereignty body position know whetherhe do feel call please remedy call act great emergency confront today look seem dangerous think last impressed remark make distinguished majority_leader impress remark distinguished distinguished other side great conflict thought today much conflict thought last act unprecedented solidarity vote support proposal need hour action action poise balanced complete accord tradition constitutional heritage today situation change near_future crisis unforeseen quarter look today conside- remark majority_leader hand remark distinguished senator take opposition side ipon other argument worth careful consideration worthy deep weight breathing_spell chance examine pende bill carefullyan opportunity other day act itit seem part wisdom logical course great body great deliberative_body world follow go strike toto hand keep toto other hand more deliberation try fashion piece legislation light present circumstance afternoon coal strike settle railroad strike worthy recollection light past history recent mind possible future history unfold event next week thought mind appeal oppose measure favor favor modified approach act afternoon inasmuch coal strike settle deliberate matter understand recess tomorrow return uittle less passion little less heat little mature_reflection see take measure ashion worthy,79.0,bound,0,1

However. I invite my colleagues to look at what is happening in the financial markets since the budget package has been announced. The U.S. dollar is very weak. People are buying yen. Swiss francs. and foregin currencies and are getting away from the dollar. It is a severe. serious problem for our economy when people try to get out of dollardenominated accounts and try to invest in other countries. We cannot overlook that here in the Congress. I know many of my colleagues are under the opinion that we have to pass this package or else real financial calamity will come. Mr. President. I do not buy that. When you analyze this package. a rather small amount of cuts that are made in the first year in the budget in terms of lasting spending restrictions. I know my colleague from Texas. whom I respect and admire as much as any Member of this Senate. Senator GRAMM. has given me some numbers where he predicts the Federal budget will be $1.385 trillion in 1995. If I thought that were true I would be the first one to jump on board and vote for this package. I do not happen to believe that is true. I believe what we are doing with this socalled budget package is. we are asking the working men and women in the country to spend 12 cents a gallon for gasoline taxes. not put the money in the highway trust fund to build roads with it. but so that we can allow the bureaucratic welfare state to continue to grow. I do not think that is a good deal for the country. I do not feel that foreign investors are going to think it is a good deal for the country. I do not think it is going to attract capital in the United States. Capital is going to flow when tax policy is positive. toward what used to be called Reagonomics when all the money flowed into this country. where people thought it was a good place to invest and get a good return to investment. We cannot overlook that. Mr. President. when you look through some of the things contained in this taxandspend package. this country would be better off to have gone ahead on the policy the President started out on. a sequester. The President was the one who ran on the platform that he did not want new taxes. I must say. as a Republican. I wept the other night when I watched the speech of the President and of our very distinguished majority leader on television. Then I weep even more when I see the President say in the press. as it is reported today. ""Blame me. for those people that are having trouble on voting for it. blame me."" All I can say. Mr. President. is I thought the President had to compromise with the majority leader and the Speaker and the majority in the Congress. who wanted taxes on the table and a taxincrease package. to get a package through the budget negotiators. I do not criticize my colleagues because I know the fiscal year came to an end. You are under pressure. Everybody is on the diving board. diving off. and they have to jump in the water feet first or head first. So they came out with the best package they could get. In my opinion. Mr. President. this country would be way better off if we did have a modified sequester. There is no reason why we would have to close the airlines and close the meat inspectors and not have milk for the children in the inner city. We can do those things. but have a modified sequester that will. in fact. actually save $50 billion in outlays for fiscal year 1991 that the markets and the world can see. and they would know that the Congress was serious and the administration was serious about restraining growth and spending. My fear is that when you look at a $500 billion package with most of the savings to be made in the outyears. they will not become a reality. The only thing that will become a reality is that the working men and women of the country. yes. the middleclass people who work for wages. raise their families. try to educate their children and get up in morning and go to work every day. are going to be asked to pay more money for gasoline and other excise taxes that will come right out of their budgets. That will be real. But the Congress will somehow. in the end. get around the actual savings in those other appropriated accounts and the money will not be saved. It just appears to this Senator that we would be way better off. and the White House. I think. would be way better off. if the President would simply say. ""I tried. we could not get the budget package I wanted."" and let us have this sequester. Make some modifications in it so we can live with it. Adjourn this Congress and then let the American people vote on this issue Those that want to raise taxes can go out and say so. and those that do not can say they do not. We can either solve this budget crisis by one or two ways. either spend more money and raise more taxes and have more Government. or hold the line on spending and let the private sector grow. What has attracted capital and investment in the United States has been a favorable view of tax policy the last few years in this country. We are running rapidly away from that. I. in good conscience. Just do not believe I can vote for a budget that. in my opinion. will push this country into a recession. Let me tell you why I think it will. Look at the financial markets. Mr. President. The dollar is going down every day. I think we all know that the responsible people at the Fed are going to say we must protect and defend the dollar. When they start defending the dollar with shortterm rates. by raising interest rates to flatten out the yield curve between longterm and shortterm rates. it will tumble this country into a recession. If you think you have a budget problem now. Mr. President. we really will have a budget problem if we see a slowdown in our economy. So it just seems to me that this is not Armageddon. If this first package is rejected. we would be better off to take some of the other suggestions that have been introduced. Our colleague. Senator ROTH. has a proposition. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the RECORD at this point a statement by Senator BILL ROTH on his alternative budget. a plan for economic growth. and the tables that accompany it to show that there is another way that this can be done without raising taxes. I also would call attention to my colleagues that last week Senator BuRNs along with several other Senators introduced a package called the 4percent solution. where there is no new taxes. You slip the targets on GrammRudman and freeze all Federal spending at the baseline projected to grow from $1.2 trillion in fiscal 1990. allow it to increase only at a rate of 4 percent. This can be accomplished.\n'",try difficult circumstance watch commodity price watch yield curve shortterm rate longterm rate budget package pass pass know many colleague sincere think pass go kind calamity financial market invite colleague look happen financial market budget package announce dollar weak people buy yen_swiss franc foregin currency get dollar severe serious problem economy people try get dollardenominated account try invest other country overlook know many colleague opinion pass package real financial calamity come buy analyze package small amount cut make first year budget term last spending restriction know colleague respect admire give number predict federal budget think true first jump board vote package happen believe true believe do socalled budget package ask work man woman country spend cent_gallon gasoline taxis put money highway trust fund build road allow bureaucratic welfare state continue grow think good deal country feel foreign investor go think good deal country think go attract capital go flow tax policy positive use call money flow country people think good place invest get good return investment overlook look thing contain taxandspend package country well go policy start sequester run platform want new taxis say weep other night watch speech distinguished majority_leader television weep more see say press report today blame people have trouble vote blame say think compromise majority_leader majority want taxis table taxincrease package get package budget negotiator criticize colleague know fiscal year come end pressure diving board dive jump water foot head come good package get opinion country modify sequester reason close airline close meat inspector milk child inner_city thing modify sequester fact save outlay fiscal year market world see know serious administration serious restrain growth spending fear look package most saving make outyear become reality only thing become reality work man woman country middleclass people work wage raise family try educate child get morning go work day go ask pay more money gasoline other excise_taxis come budget real end get actual saving other appropriated account money save appear think say try get budget package want let sequester make modification live adjourn let american people vote issue want raise taxis go say say solve budget crisis way spend more money raise more taxis more government hold line spending let private_sector grow attract capital investment favorable view tax policy last few year country run good conscience believe vote budget opinion push country recession let tell think look financial market dollar go day think know responsible people go say protect defend dollar start defend dollar shortterm rate raise interest rate flatten yield curve longterm shortterm rate tumble country recession think budget problem budget problem see slowdown economy seem first package reject well take other suggestion introduce colleague proposition ask_unanimous consent print_record point statement alternative budget plan economic growth table accompany show way do raise taxis call attention colleague last week several other introduce package call solution new taxis slip target freeze federal spending baseline project grow fiscal allow increase rate percent accomplished.\n,101.0,daily,1,0

I rise to join my colleagues in paying tribute to the Honorable George P. Miller. who died on December 29. 1982. Ire was a man of exceptional ability not only in such subjects as oceanography and astronautics. but also a man with the perceptive ability to coordinate scientific programs without benefit of precedent. past guidelines. or studies to lead him. George Miller. who retired at the close of .the 92d Congress in 1972. was the chairman of the Committee on Science and Astronautics. now called the Science and Technology Committee. In the four terms I had the privilege to serve with him in the House. I observed with admiration the dedication. enthusiasm. and inspiring diligence of this outstanding legislator and it was with pride that I called him a friend. I missed him here In the Halls of Congress and he served the people of the Eighth District of California so well by playing a major role in the consideration and passage of many measures helpful to the people of his district and the best interests of his country. Chairman Miller came to the House in 1945 following a career in the California State Legislature and. before that. as a civil engineer. As a leader in California politics. George Miller served as a member of the State land commission and as executive director of the California Division of Fish and Game. Here in the Congress. George was a highly effective member of the Post Office and Civil Service Committee and a highly regarded member of the Armed Services Committee. Additionally. he served as chairman of the first Subcommittee on Oceanography. and as a member of the Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee. George Miller took over as chairman of the newly created Committee on Science and Astronautics in 1961. If ever there was a time that innovative creativity was called for. it was at the beginning stages of our space program. Though there was much enthusiasm for space projects. no people. no government. and no legislator had had any experience in organizing and administering public projects of such magnitude. It was George Miller who stepped into the breach and his leadership came to be recognized by the people of his State and Nation. as well as by his colleagues in the House. as one of unparalleled excellence. Under Georges leadership. the Committee on Science and Astronautics reviewed the outofdate charter of the National Science Foundation. revised and modernized it. and succeeded in securing its approval as public law. The Foundation is now able to more rigorously apply the results of basic research to the social needs facing our country. George Millers committee also was responsible for development of the concept of an Office of Technology Assessment. Congress thus created for itself a new and sorely needed independent service institution within the legislative branch to insure a proper balance of power between the legislative and executive branches of our Government. George was one of those infrequent figures in history who retired with the assurance that through his efforts mankind benefited. There is no tribute higher than this.

Not far from Jamestown. in the county of Westmoreland. which this year will celebrate its 300th anniversary. was born the first President of the United States. and not far from Plymouth was born John Adams. the second President. The third President of the United States. Thomas Jefferson. was born in Albemarle County. Va.. about 125 miles from Jamestown. but the fourth and fifth Presidents. Madison and Monroe. were born in the same county in which Washington was born. In that county likewise were born Light Horse Harry Lee and his famous son. Gen. Robert E. Lee. Among the early settlers on the James River. near Jamestown. was William Byrd. He was the builder of that lovely James River home. Westover. the founder of Richmond. Virginias capital city. and one of the ablest businessmen of the early colonial period. He accompanied Gov. Alexander Spotswood on his historic trip across the Blue Ridge Mountains in 1716. when for the first time a white man saw the fertile area now known as the Shenandoah Valley. in which his descendant. HARRY FLOOD BYRD. was born. Last summer. when BYRD was a candidate in the Democratic primary for reelection to the Senate. I addressed my friends of Staunton and Augusta. on July 8. in behalf of his nomination. saying I could testify ""not on the basis of hearsay. but as an eyewitness of the public career of a friend who has become not only a leader in the greatest legislative body in the world but a national figure of whom every Virginian may justly be proud."" I concluded that address by urging ""every Virginia Democrat who believes in honesty and integrity of government. in free enterprise and in those principles of constitutional democracy for which Thomas Jefferson. Andrew Jackson. and Woodrow Wilson stood to rally now to the support of HARRY FLOOD BYRD as their logical champion."" A few days later I renewed that plea over the radio and television. at Norfolk. While I was not an eyewitness to his birth. as I was born just 13 days before he was. HARRY BYRD and I were born on the same street and in the same town. Our friendship and first public service commenced in January 1916. when we were deskmates in the State senate in Richmond. For 6 years we served together in that body. In 1925. BYRD was elected Governor of Virginia. and during the 4 years of his term as Governor. I served in his cabinet. so to speak. as chairman of the Virginia Commission of Game and Inland Fisheries. In the fall of 1932. I was elected to the House of Representatives. and in the spring of 1933. when Senator Claude A. Swanson resigned to become Secretary of the Navy. BYRD was appointed a Senator from Virginia. On March 4. 1933. we both took the same oath of office as Members of the Congress. he in the Senate and I in the House. In November 1946. I was elected to succeed the late Carter Glass. and again joined HARRY BYRD as a Senate colleague. During our service of 20 yearsin the Congress. BYRD has continued to exhibit the qualities of ability and integrity which attracted national attention to him as Governor and made him a serious contender for the Presidency in 1932. On the comparatively few occasions during our congressional service when we have found ourselves on opposite sides of an issue. I have given him the same credit for sincerity of motives which I expected and received from him. Since the outstanding character of BYRDS record in the Senate is so well known to his Senate colleagues. I shall use this occasion to bear eyewitness. as I said at Staunton. to his contributions to good government in our home State of Virginia. In 1908. when he was only 21 years of age. but already had demonstrated his business ability. BYRD was elected president of the Valley Turnpike Co.. which had built 90 miles of hardsurfaced road from Winchester to Staunton. financing it by the collection of tolls. Consequently. when BYRD entered the State Senate in 1916a period of transition from ""horseandbuggy days"" to motor transporthe not only was aware of the value of improved roads. but also was imbued with an ambition to lift the Virginia farmers out of the mud. In realizing that ambition. future generations can say of him: Careless of the monument by the grave. he built in the world a monument by which men might be taught to remember not where he died. but where he lived. Virginians. I frankly admit. have a weakness for boasting of the glory of their past. I trust. however. that I am indulging in no idle boast when I say that I regard Virginias highway system as equal to any in the Nation. Certainly future generations will consider that highway system as an enduring monument to where BYRD lived. because under his payasyougo policy we built that highway system without a State debt. In 1916. State Senator OConnor Goolrick. of Fredericksburg. Senator BYRD. and I became joint patrons of a resolution to lay out a State highway system. The resolution called for the appointment by the Governor of a commission from the General Assembly. of which Goolrick. BYRD. and I were members. with Goolrick serving as chairman. In January 1918. we submitted our report to Gov. Henry Carter Stuart. At that time I was a first lieutenant. assigned to the 318th Infantry of the 80th Division. but Governor Stuart prevailed upon the Adjutant General of the Army to give me a brief leave of absence so that I could assist in securing the adoption of a bill to create a State highway system. As soon as that bill had been passed. the issue. of course. arose as to how so ambitious a road program would be financed. Senator BYRD assumed the leadership of those who favored a payasyougo policy. and largely out of his own funds. he financed the campaign which resulted in the defeat of a State bond issue. It was not surprising. therefore. that in the spring of 1925. Virginians. who favored a payasyougo policy not only i612 for roads. but in all other governmental actions. regarded BYRD as their logical candidate for the governorship. He was elected in 1925. and assumed office the following January. During the next 4 years. BYRD gave our State an administration which was outstanding in two respects: It was definitely progressive in its objectives. while conservative in its method of financing those objectives. We embarked upon an ambitious State highway building program. to be financed by a gasoline tax and license fees from motor vehicles. all strictly segregated for highway purposes. Appropriations for public education were increased. while the State land tax was being abolished. Additional State revenue was secured by increasing the franchise tax on railroads and all other public utilities. Meanwhile. economies were brought about by a reorganization and consolidation of State bureaus. In subsequent years more than one State government has studied Byrds Virginia reorganization plan. Commencing with World War II in Europe. when we furnished our allies large supplies. and later became an active participant. we have been operating at a relatively high level of prosperity. at times it might properly be called a boom. But during the early 1930s agriculture was never more depressed. Virginia still is to a large extent an agricultural State. During that depression period the State had assumed responsibility only for the roads that were included in the State highway system. All other public roads were called county highways. and each county was responsible for the construction and maintenance of its own county roads. The county road tax was the heaviest tax our farmers had to pay. Realizing that the State. with its better engineering facilities and more adequate supply of heavy road machinery. could build and maintain county roads more efficiently than could the local boards of supervisors. and that assumption by the State of the construction and maintenance of county roads would lift a heavy tax burden from our farmers. BYRD proposed that the State assume responsibility for all public roads. The legislature adopted that suggestion. and. although he was not a member of the legislature at the time. that law is now known in Virginia as the Byrd road law. Extensions of the State system were delayed temporarily by that program. but Immediate progress was noticeable in all the rural areas of Virginia. and before long the increase in the use of motor vehicles and the increase of tourist traffic in Virginia produced sufficient additional revenue from the gasoline tax to finance successfully the enlarged undertaking. When BYRD was elected to the State senate in 1916 he was a farmer. and he has been a farmer all his life. In fact. solely through his own efforts. not only has he become the largest individual orchardist in Virginia. but with an annual production now of about 1 /2 million bushels of apples a year. he is no doubt the largest apple producer in the world. But BYRD also was a businessman. and. as such. he fully realized that the average farmer did not enjoy a pro rata share of the national income. and that any State largely dependent for its revenue upon agriculture would fall behind in an industrial age. in which mans productivity could be increased tenfold by power machinery. Therefore. as Governor of Virginia. one of his major undertakings was to bring new industry into Virginia. He accomplished this through giving assurance of a fair and just tax rate and of adequate protection against illegal actions of any kind. The revenue the Federal Government now collects from Virginia is testimony to how well BYRD worked to balance agriculture with industry in Virginia. Near his home. at Front Royal. is the rayon plant of the American Viscose Co.. the largest single plant of its kind in the world. At Newport News we have the largest privately owned shipbuilding and drydock company in the world. At Fredericksburg there is located a cellophane plant which puts out each year enough cellophane to pave a onelane highway from Fredericksburg to the moon. At Danville we have a cotton mill whose daily capacity of cotton cloth. 1 yard wide. would stretch from Danville to New York. wrap around the Empire State Building. and come back to Philadelphia. At Bassett we have the largest singleunit furniture plant in the world. and at Suffolk. the largest peanut factory in the world. In all types of textileswoolens. cotton goods. rayon. and nylonVirginia has become a major producer. The Du Pont Co.. for instance. has large textile plants at Ampthill. near Richmond. at Martinsville. and at Waynesboro. In my opinion. the best test of a mans worth to his day and generation is what endures after he is dead and gone. Future generations will be able to look back upon two enduring monuments to HARRY BYRDS ability and interest in the development of his native State: A highway system that has greatly promoted the * commerce of the State. as well as being a joy and a delight to all tourists. and an industrial empire which has greatly improved the lot of industrial workers. given employment to many submarginal farm operators. and assured the State of dependable revenue for the support of such major undertakings as public schools. colleges. eleemosynary institutions. and the conservation and development of natural resources. It is no wonder. therefore. that the inefficiency and wastefulness of our Federal Government during recent years have weighed so heavily upon the heart of a man like HARRY BYRD. who would like to see duplicated on a national scale what has been accomplishedif. with all due deference.

810058499,H,19490504,512,Mr. WELCH of California,Unknown,WELCH,California,M,9937,10109,05041949.txt,6314,357,81092890,WELCH,RICHARD,H,CA,M,R,5.0,voting,Mr. Speaker. the bill under consideration is to authorize the American River Basin development. California. for irrigation and reclamation. and for other purposes. If its purpose is carried out. it will make the American River Basin and Folsom Dam an integral part of the great Central Valley project. It is to be built by the United States Army engineers at an estimated cost of $51.800.000. It will be selfliquidating. The reservoir behind the dam will have a capacity of 1.000.000 acrefeet of water. and from it will be developed 120.000 kilowatts of hydroelectric power. This project will help to relieve the critical shortage of both water and power which exists from one end of the State of California to the other. The President of the United States sent a special message to Congress and also a letter to the chairman of the Public Lands Committee urging Immediate consideration of this legislation. It has been approved by the Governor of the State of California and the Department of the Interior. The bill was carefully considered by the Public Lands Committee. and large delegations from California. representing various interests. appeared and testified at hearings on this project and bill. No opposition to the bill developed. and it was reported unanimously by the committee with a favorable recommendation. The national reclamation program was born at the turn of the century under the administration of President Theodore Roosevelt. Since that time there have been four other Presidents in the White HouseCalvin Coolidge. Herbert Hoover. Franklin Delano Roosevelt. and Harry S. Trumanwho. like Theodore Roosevelt. have given consideration and outstanding assistance to the problems of the western section of the United States. Reclamation is no longer limited to the simple reclamation of land. Out of it has grown one of the most vital products necessary to our Nations security and economy. the generation of hydroelectric power. The Central Valley pro~ect was inaugurated in 1933 by an act of the California State Legislature. Subsequently the adversaries of the Central Valley project were instrumental in bringing about a referendum in an attempt to defeat the act. I was one of a group of Representatives. headed by the lato Senator Hiram W. Johnson. o: California. who toik the Central Valley project of California to President Franklin Delano Roosevelt who. gave it his wholehearted support. As I have previously pointed oTL. the Central Valley comprises a vast empire. equal to the combined area of Massachusetts. Connecticut. Rhode Island. and onehalf the State of New Jersey. It is traversed by two great navigable rivers flowing into San Francisco Bay. It is estimated bptween eleven and fifteen million acrefeet of fresh water annually run out of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers into the Bay of San Francisco. an arm of the Pacific Ocean. One of the primary objects of the project has been to save from salt water infiltration over 1.000.000 acres of the most fertile land in the world. Before the Federal Government undertook this project more than 50.000 acres already had been destroyed. To carry out this project it was necessary to build two large dams. the Shasta Dam and the Friant Dam. The Friant Dam at the southerly end of the valley is not a multiple dam and does not develop hydroelectric power. The Shasta Dam. however. is capable of developing 450.000 kilowatts of hydroelectricity. This great dam with its power development is an integral part of the entire project. designed as a soil conservation measure and also of tremendous importance from the standpoint of national defense. Mr. Speaker. oil and electric energy are two of the greatest assets in our national economy and national defense. Every barrel of oil taken from the ground and used is gone forever. I have learned from the best possible source of information the astounding fact that if the full hydroelectric potentialities of the United States west of the Mississippi River were utilized the amount of power thereby produced would be the equivalent of the amount of electric power that could be obtained by burning 600.000.000 barrels of oil per year. The American Petroleum Institute has estimated that the oil reserves from known petroleum deposits in the United States at the end of 1947 were 21.488.000.000 barrels. Production of oil for the year 1947 was 1.989.000.000 barrels. From this rate of production and use of oil we can readily see our known oil reserves will last for approximately 10 years. In 1948 production was stepped up from 1.999.000.000 barrels to 2.016.000.000 barrels. or an approximate 8percent increase in production. The legislation presently pending before the committee pertains strictly to the State of California. California is not a coalproducing State and must therefore depend entirely upon oil or electricity. On December 31. 1947. Californias known oil reserves were 3.295.000.000 barrels. In 1948 California produced 340.089.000 barrels of petroleum. Thus it will be seen that Californias known oil reserves will be exhausted in approximately 10 years. Despite this alarming fact. California uses more petroleum for the generation of steam than any other State in the Nation. In the year 1947 our State burned in the generation of electricity 15.999.693 barrels. Californias population in 1940 was .6.907.387. On July 1. 1948. It was estimated by the Bureau of the Census to be 10.031.000. or an increase of between 45 and 46 percent. which is the greatest shift of population in the history of this country. In the face of this enormous growth in population. which has brought with it increased demands for both water and power from one end of the State to the other. we are told that .the Federal Government should not loan its credit to relieve a condition over which the people of California have no control. Hydroelectric power is almost inexhaustible. Every reclamation project developing hydroelectric power conserves just that much of our oil reserves for future use and extends the life of those reserves. Mr. Speaker. it should be understood that money appropriated for reclamation projects does not constitute a Government subsidy. It is an investment in the future of America. every dollar of which must and will be repaid over a period of time.\n',bill consideration authorize development irrigation_reclamation other purpose purpose carry make integral_part great project build engineer estimate cost selfliquidate reservoir dam capacity acrefeet_water develop kilowatt_hydroelectric power project help relieve critical shortage water power exist end other send special message letter chairman urge immediate consideration legislation approve bill consider large delegation represent various interest appear testify hearing project bill opposition bill develop report committee favorable recommendation national reclamation program bear turn century administration time other president give consideration outstanding assistance problem western section reclamation limit simple reclamation land grow vital product necessary security economy generation hydroelectric_power pro ~_ect inaugurate act adversary project instrumental bring referendum attempt defeat act group head lato toik project give wholehearted_support point comprise vast empire equal combined area traverse great navigable_river flow estimate bptween acrefeet fresh water run arm primary object project save salt water infiltration acre fertile land world undertake project more acre destroy carry project necessary build large dam southerly end valley multiple dam develop hydroelectric_power capable develop kilowatt_hydroelectricity great dam power development integral_part entire project design soil_conservation measure tremendous importance standpoint national defense oil electric energy great asset national economy national defense barrel_oil take ground use go learn good possible source information astounding fact full hydroelectric potentiality west utilize amount power produce equivalent amount electric power obtain burn barrel_oil year estimate oil reserve know petroleum deposit end barrel production oil year barrel rate production use oil see know oil reserve last year production step barrel 2.016.000.000 barrel approximate_8percent increase production legislation pende committee pertain coalproducing state depend oil electricity known oil reserve barrel produce barrel petroleum see known oil reserve exhaust year alarming fact use more petroleum generation steam other state nation year state burn generation electricity 15.999.693 barrel population .6.907.387 estimate increase percent great shift population history country face enormous growth population bring increase demand water power end other tell loan credit relieve condition people control hydroelectric_power inexhaustible reclamation_project develop hydroelectric_power conserve much oil reserve future use extend life reserve understand money appropriate reclamation_project constitute subsidy investment future dollar repay period time.\n,81.0,bound,1,0

I invite attention to the fact that yesterday the Legislature of the State of New York passed a measure to authorize the expenditure of $5 million for aid to the New York. New Haven and Hartford Railroad. This amount was set aside as part of a plan agreed upon by Governors Rockefeller of New York. and Dempsey of Connecticut whereby the States of New York and Connecticut offered to allocate $5 million each and to request $10 million Federal aid under the Mass Transportation Act of 1964. It is hoped that additional funds will also be made available by the States affected by the commuter operations of the New Haven Railroad to meet the critical situation with respect to operational costs in accord with a com*prehensive plan as to expenditures as called for in S. 1234. and that the Federal Government will also provide needed financial assistance for a limited period. With such joint participation. I think we can look forward to an easing of the current commuter crisis on the New Haven. In the meantime. the State of New York has taken the first step to show good faith and a readiness to implement the plan. That door now having been opened. we have a right to feel encouraged thatif the trustees will help. and if the Interstate Commerce Commission and the other Government agencies concerned will demonstrate their understanding. and if Congress will be ready to lend a hand. there is a real prospect that a constructive step may be taken to place certain commuter railroads of the country. starting with the New Haven. on .a rational basis which will enable them to be continued without sacrifices on the part of thousands of commuters who use these rail services daily.

1030162449,S,19940511,216,Mr. DURENBERGER,Unknown,DURENBERGER,Unknown,M,16058,16186,05111994.txt,4483,319,103108211,DURENBERGER,DAVID,S,MN,M,R,,voting,Mr. President. I am pleased to rise in support of final passage of the conference committee agreement on S. 2000 which includes reauthorization of the Head Start Program. There are a number of positive features in this reauthorization. Mr. President. including continued emphasis on improving quality. greater performance accountability for Head Start agencies. and increased authority to use Head Start funds for yearaground programs and initiatives that serve very young children and their families. In addition. the conference committee accepted the Senates position authorizing the use of Head Start funds for facilities c4nstruction in lowincome communities if there are not other facilities available. if the lack of facilities will inhibit the operation of the program. and if construction Is more costeffective than purchase of available facilities. The final bill also permits Head Start grantees to make capital expendituresincluding amortizing the principal and paying the interest on loans--for construction of facilities. major renovation of facilities. and purchase of vehicles used for programs located at Head S art facilities. Unfortunately. the conference committee did not adopt the Senate position that Head Start children should be automatically eligible for meals under the child care food program. The conferees were sympathetic to the burdens placed on Head Start agencies in establishing eligibility for the child care food program. But. the conferees did not feel they had jurisdiction to expand eligibility for what is. in effect. an entitlement program under the jurisdiction of the Agriculture Committees in both Houses of Congress. The conferees did. however. urge the Secretaries of HHS and Agriculture to work together to accomplish the goal of joint eligibility through regulatory changes and urged the appropriate authorizing committees to address the problem during the reauthorization of other child nutrition programs. Mr. President. I am most pleased that the conference agreement maintains and expands on the goal I have been pushing throughout this reauthorization that we encourage flexibility to meet the changing needs of todays Head Start families and that we encourage a greater degree of collaboration between Head Start. subsidized child care. and other programs that serve lowincome children and their parents. For example. the conference committee agreement directs the Secretary of HHS to encourage the development and testing of innovative. locally designed options to extend the hours of service of Head Start agencies to meet local needs. Optiofs .4dentifled by the conferees include collaboration with child care and other child and family service programs where such collaborations maintain the quality and integrity of services provided under Head Starts performance standards. Where administrative rules and regulations are a barrier to effectively combining funds. from different Federal program sources. the conferees also urged that a timely mechanism for requesting and granting waivers be put into place. Head Starts authorizing legislation and administrative rules already allow national and regional administrators and local agencies considerable freedom to design local programs to meet local needs. So. the real test of whether we will see increased collaboration with other early childhood services will depend on how this reauthorization is actually administered. With that challenge in mind. Mr. President. I have today written HHS Secretary Donna Shalala to encourage her and others in the administration to fully implement the collaborative spirit of this reauthorization. I would ask that a copy of my letter to Secretary Shalala be printed at the conclusion of my remarks. Mr. President. I want to pay tribute to the principal authors of this legislation for their diligent efforts to steer its passage through the Senate and for their openness to the ideas and suggestions for improvements that I and others have authored. I also want to pay special tribute to the thousands of Minnesotans who labor each day in the Head Start classrooms. offices. and homes of my State--as teachers. aides. drivers. administrators and others.

I wish to call attention to a certain portion of the hearings which were taken before the subcommittee of the House Committee on Indian Affairs which relates to the subject which was under discussion yesterday. namely. the Fort Hall Reservation. The Senator seemed to think at that time that there might have been something personal in my remarks. There was nothIng of the sort intended by me. It was the general condition which prevails to which I referred. About this particular instance I was not so well informed as I was upon some others. but I find on reading the report of the hearings that when this project was brought up. Mr. CARTER. a Member of the House. brought out a statement from Mr. Reed. who is the superintendeant of irrigation for all these reclamation projects in relation to it. For the information of the Senate. I should like to say to those who are interested in the matter that when a reclamation scheme is applied to land of Indians all of his lands become responsible for the payment of the cost of the same. The expense for the irrigation of bottom lands which are cultivable is placed on all the lands of the entire reserve and becomes a lien upon it. a claim upon it for which it is held for the repayment of the expenditure necessary to bring water upon that portion of the land which can be irrigated. In the matter of the Fort Hall project it seems there was something like $800.000 expended. a portion of which. as near as I can ascertain. perhaps all of which. was reimbursable to the Government from the sale of the Indian lands. Mr. CARTER. who took an interest. asked some questions of Mr. Reed. who is the superintendent of irrigation. Mr. CARTER said: I notice that In your justification you state that there are 35.000 acres which may be irrigated. and that there are now irrigated by Indians 3.300 acres. by whites 5.900 acres. and leased 185 acres.

At that time our distinguished Speaker. JOHN W. McCoPhIAcH. was majority leader for the U.S. House of Representatives. Even though I was an attorney and acquainted with legal procedures and was versed with the parliamentary procedures that I had encountered In the general assembly in the Commonwealth of Kentucky. I found in JOHN W. McCoRMACK a great ally of the freshman Congressmen. a distinguished gentleman who believed in liberal and progressive legislation. a gentleman who. in spite of the demands of his position in the House. was always willing to provide his experience and counsel and help to a Member who earnestly sought to reflect the needs of his district In legislation before the Congress. I treasure those moments with JOHN MCCORMACK the then majority leader of the House. I treasure further the opportunities I have had for his counsel. for his wisdom. for his infinite legislative experience as he assumed the mantle of Speaker. In spite of the awesome responsibilities with which this title confers. JOHN McCoRMACK has continued to be responsive to the needs of Members of the House. be they newcomers or be they Members with years of experience. Throughout his legislative career. I have been greatly impressed with Speaker MCCORMAcKs driving sense of responsibility to meet the urgent needs of the American people. Regardless of their geographical location. regardless of the origin or creed. Speaker MCCORMACK has been sensitive to the fashioning of legislation to provide opportunities for Americans to develop their full potential unrestricted by unfair competition and unrestricted by economic disadvantage. Representative MCCORMACK. Majority Whip McCORMACK. Majority Leader McCORMACK. and Speaker MCCORMACK has served his Nation loyally. his constituency dilligently and mankind with effectiveness that will be marked in the pages of history with greater emphasis than I or any other Member can convey at this time. As a Member who has loved him and a Member who has treasured relationships with him I wish him well in what I know will be an effective retirement. A retirement that calls for his leadership abilities in many areas. Mr. Speaker. it is with genuine pleasure and a deep sense of affection that I join my colleagues in paying tribute to one of the most distinguished men that America has ever sent to this House of Representatives. our beloved JOHN MCCORmeACK. of Massachusetts. Long before I ever came to Congress. JOHN McCORMAcKs name was synonymous with progress. leadership. and a development of programs that are now an integral part of American life. As I have worked with JOHN McCoRMACK for 10 years. three things have come through sharp and clear: First. his understanding of the problems of Members and his reconciliation always of those problems. second. his integrity. gentlemanliness. and sense of decency. and. third. his fairness to every human being. Women have not always been the most popular Members of the Congress. yet it was with no hesitation whatsoever that JOHN McCORMACK. as a majority leader and Speaker. has seen that women were treated fairly and equally. I sometimes fear that in our haste to change our fashions. we often forget enduring contributions made by our leadership. so I do want to speak for American women in thanking JOHN MCCORMACK for his fairness and great sense of justice. I salute our great and distinguished Speaker and wish him and Mrs. McCormack the happiest of years ahead.\n',come feel challenge find solution work many need confront eastern congressional district privilege privilege represent time distinguished majority_leader attorney acquaint legal procedure verse parliamentary_procedure encounter general assembly find great ally freshman distinguished gentleman believe liberal progressive legislation gentleman spite demand position willing provide experience counsel help seek reflect need district legislation treasure moment majority_leader treasure opportunity counsel wisdom infinite legislative experience assume mantle spite awesome_responsibility title confer continue responsive need member newcomer member year experience legislative career impressed drive sense responsibility meet urgent need american people geographical_location origin creed sensitive fashioning legislation provide opportunity develop full potential unrestricte unfair competition unrestricted economic disadvantage serve nation constituency mankind effectiveness mark page history great emphasis other convey time love treasure relationship wish know effective retirement retirement call leadership ability many area genuine pleasure deep sense affection join colleague pay tribute distinguished man send beloved come name_synonymous progress leadership development program integral_part american life work year thing come sharp clear understanding problem member reconciliation problem integrity gentlemanliness sense decency third fairness human_being woman popular member hesitation majority_leader see woman treat fear haste change fashion forget endure contribution make leadership want speak american woman thank fairness great sense justice salute great distinguished wish happy year ahead.\n,91.0,bound,0,1

I rise to join with my colleagues In the House of Representatives in calling for an end to the illegal occupation of this country. Sixteen years ago. on July 20. 1974. Turk. Ish armed forces occupied the Northern part of Cyprus. forcing 180.000 people to abandon their homes and flee south. Ancient churches were destroyed. and numerous atrocities were committed against GreekCypriots by their Turkish Invaders. Today. under the nonpartisan eye of the United Nations Secretary General. negotiations to reach a peaceful resolution to this occupation. are at a standstill. These talks were undermined by the unreasonableness of Rauf Denktash. leader of the Turkish occupiers. and I believe that it is appropriate for the United States to now turn up the pressure and play a decisive role in resolving this situation. As the wave of democracy continues to sweep across Europe. the time has come to let the Turkish government know that the status quo of a divided Cyprus is no longer acceptable. Inasmuch as the role of NATO is now changing and is being redefined. all arguments of providing any United States economic or military assistance to Turkey must also be reevaluated. Congress must end United States aid to Turkey. until this illegal occupation comes to an end. Mr. Speaker. on the occasion of the 16th anniversary of this Illegal occupation of the Republic of Cyprus.

Mich.. has challenged the wisdom of Congress. I call attention to this girlbecause I feel that too many of my colleagues will consider her challenge as an idle threat to this peerless body. I am taking this opportunity to assure my colleagues that neither this girl nor her challenge is idle. Once she laid down this challenge. boys from her hometown came to the defense of Congress. She and the Mayor of Ypsilanti beat them into submission. The little girl in question is 12yearold Carolyn King. She is a Little League baseball player. although not in the eyes of Little League headquarters in Williamsport. Pa. When she won a position on one of Ypsilantis Little League teams. the order came from Williamsport that if she were not removed from the teams roster. the League would withdraw Ypsilantis charter. There was hesitation at firston the part of the local Little League representatives. the towns elected officials. and even on Carolyns part. She did not want to cause any trouble. She just wanted to play baseball. The mayor of Ypsilanti. George Goodman. acted first. Mayor Goodman simply informed the men in Williamsport that if Carolyn were not allowed to play Little League baseball. the Little League would not be allowed to use any of the citys baseball fields. Carolyn is now playing baseball. but Ypsilantis charter has been withdrawn. The simple fact. however. is that in acting to prevent Carolyn from playing baseball. the Little League people in Williamsport. formally known as Little League Baseball. Inc.. were entirely within the bounds of congressionally approved legislation. Little League Baseball. Inc.. in fact. was created by an act of Congress. (Public Law 88378.) In enacting this legislation. Congress declared that one of the purposes of the corporation would be ""to promote. develop. supervise. and voluntarily assist in all lawful ways the interest of boys who will participate in Little League baseball."" The language of this legislation thus precludes the participation of girls in Little League baseball despite the fact that the local leagues usually play on cityowned fields and often receive funds from the municipalities in which they are located. Some of these funds come from the revenuesharing program enacted by the 92d Congress. In effect. Congress has approved the use of Federal moneys to fund an organization which. by the very language of the charter under which it operates. is discriminatory. To correct this discriminatory situation. there are very few alternative courses of action available to Congress. We could repeal the act that incorporated Little League baseball. We could even enact legislation that would terminate Little League baseballs tax exempt status. Neither of these alternatives is desirable in this case. however. and I would not support proposals of this type. The only real alternative open to Congress in this case is to amend the act that incorporated Little League Baseball to place girls on an equal footing with boys under the Little Leagues Federal charter. and. today. I am introducing legislation that will accomplish this end. There are no hidden results intended In my proposal. Girls would not be required to use the same locker room as the boys. and if a girl was removed from a game liecause she was pitching badly she would not be sent to the mens showers. There would be no quota systems involved. and Little League teams would not be required to submit their rosters to HEW each spring for review. And. a girl that could not field ground balls or hit fastballs would not be granted any more advantage in ""getting. on the team"" than a boy with similar deficiencies. Let me assure you that if Billy Martin of the Detroit Tigers or Leo Durocher of the Houston Astros had a chance to sign a woman who hit home runs like Hank Aaron. fielded like Al Kaline. or pitched like Wilbur Wood. they would do their best to get that womans name on a contract.

I tried to ascertain what borrowings the United States had made from the bank. The gentleman from Texas insisted there were none. In hearings on the subject this year. it was disclosed that the Asian Bank has a total of $403 million. apparently in excess funds. for they are deposited in shortterm government investments. The hearings do not specify what governments have these funds. According to hearings on the subject. in fiscal year 1966. when the United States made its initial contribution of $140 million to the Asian Bank. that same amount of money was immediately loaned back. The U.S. Treasury paid 6 percent interest on the money it borrowed to give to the bank and another 6 percent to borrow it backa total of 12 percent interest. The Asian Bank loaned Thailand $119 million and. although we had put up 20 percent *of the banks money. this handout Government of ours borrowed $100 million from Thailand. Incidentally. and from all faucets. we had pumped $1.739.700.000 into Thailand through fiscal year 1973. Mr. Chairman. I simply want the record to show the kind of financial hankypanky that goes on with just one small part of this Foreign Assistance Act.

Yet. the Federal Government has always permitted their free use for commerce and recreation. This free use has proven to be extremely effective. Waterway use has expanded to the point where existing key lock capacities have become inadequate to handle all traffic. Barges are now beginning to wait idly for long periods. resulting in severe losses of productive time. The deteriorated condition of locks and dam 26 at Alton. Ill.. with which my colleagues are now familiar. provides a vivid illustration of this problem. Congress must soon decide whether to continue Federal subsidies for the waterway industry. In so doing. it will principally need to consider the effects of this policy on competing modes of transportation. As we are called upon to approve replacement and rehabilitation projects of millions of dollars. we must weigh these considerations before. not after. we expend these vast amounts of money. And so. Mr. Speaker. I have today introduced legislation which seeks to create a more evenhanded Federal policy among the various competing modes of transportation. My bill would simply impose a 5cent per gallon tax on nongasoline fuels. and an additional 1centpergallon tax on gasoline for use in commercial water transportation. None of the waterways construction or annual operation and maintenance costs have ever been reimbursed by waterway users. This is because there has been a longstanding policy of free use dating back to the Northwest Ordinance of 1787. The ordinance stated that navigable waters leading into the Mississippi and the St. Lawrence. ""shall has been a longstanding policy of free to citizens of the United States without any tax."" However. todays waterway conditions. and their importance in bulk commodity transportation. are vastly different from those which existed in the early years when this policy was established. Since 1950 the tonnage transported on inland waterways has doubted and the tonmiles have increased almost fivefold. Although the inland waterways include less than 3 percent of the miles in the Nations transportation system. they account for 16 percent of the total tonmiles of all commodity movements. Waterway traffic volume has thus reached a point where relatively nominal user charges would recover most or all of the annual operation and maintenance costs. For example. according to a 1975 GAO report. a fuel tax of about 7 cents per gallon in 1973 would have fully absorbed the $109 million in waterway operation and maintenance expense the Corps of Engineers incurred in that year. For commercial users. this fuel tax would have increased their total operating costs by only 4 percent. It is no secret as to why use of our inland waterways for commodity transportation has increased significantly in this period. Since World War II. over $3 billion has been spent by the Federal Government to operate and maintain the inland waterway system of the United States. Nearly that amount has also been spent as capital investment on new locks and channels. The Presidents 1977 budget request included over $40 million for expenditure by the Corps of Engineers on the shallow draft inland waterways having a depth of 12 feet or less. This amount was increased to nearly a half billion dollars by recent actions in Congress. We simply can no longer insulate one mode of commerce from Federal costsharing as we have with the waterway industry. while requiring competitors to repay a major portion of their Federal cost through use taxes. Various competing modes of transportation pay registration taxes. route certification fees. State and Federal motor vehicle taxes. weight taxes. licensing and mileage taxes. gross receipt taxes. property taxes. landing fees. tire taxes. and a variety of other special levies. The water industry pays nothing. As recently as this summer. the Senate included a provision In its version of the Tax Reform Act of 1976 which would exempt commercial barge owners from State and local taxation. The fuel tax I have proposed would begin to inject some fairness and equity among the various competing transportation modes. It has been frequently stated that a waterway user charge of any kind would result in higher consumer prices. I believe there is ample evidence which indicates such increases would be slight in relation to the tax revenue generated by such a levy. In this sense. a fuel tax would substantially lessen the general revenue tax burden that the public must now carry for the annual operation and maintenance costs of the inland waterway system. The most persuasive evidence that such a tax would have only a small effect on the cost of barge transportation is revealed in a preliminary staff study by the U.S. Department of Transportations Transportation Systems Center in Cambridge. Mass. Entitled ""Regional Market. Industry and Transportation Impacts of Navigation Cost Recovery Programs: Preliminary Results."" the study states that a uniform fuel tax recovering the Corps of Engineers full operation and maintenance cost would generally increase barge transportation rates only 5 to 15 percent. with a few localized and commodity exceptions. In addition. while the preliminary findings indicate that full recovery of operation and maintenance costs would require a 22 to 24 cents per gallon fuel tax. the resulting effects on barge rates and market prices would be minor. The study states that: Predictions of substantial. generalized impacts on water carriers as the result of user charges appears unsupported by preliminary results . . . User charge impacts on regional market prices (would) rarely exceed 1 or 2 percent of delivered value per ton. significantly less than water carrier impacts . . . If railroads raise rates in response to barge rate increases due to user charges. relative impacts would be reduced. Levying a fuel tax on commercial barges would not destroy any inherent advantage of waterway transportation. but only eliminate an artificial advantage created by unequal treatment of transportation modes by the Federal Government. Mr. Speaker. a user charge to recover the costs of commercial waterway transportation is by no means a new concept. It has been proposed in some form by every President since Franklin D. Roosevelt. President Ford recommended legislation providing for recovery of these costs last year. Several different approaches of recovering costs have been suggested. The most prominent have been lockage fees or tonnage charges by river segments. I think a fuel tax is unquestionably the fairest and most equitable of the various approaches. A segmented. tonmile charge would bear most heavily on lesserused waterways. For example. industry calculations indicate that the cost per mile for a 1.500ton barge would range from 20 cents for the lower Mississippi and less than $1 for other heavily used waterways. to nearly $30 for waterways with less traffic. Lockage fees would have similarly unequal impacts. ""Interpool"" traffic which would not go through any locks would pay no fees at all. But long distance haulers. as from Minneapolis to the gulf. would have to pay lockage fees through all 27 locks. A 5cent fuel tax would pose no regional disadvantages and would be easier to administer. I have chosen 5 cents with a view toward phasing in the full recovery of operation and maintenance costs over a period of time to prevent the potentially severe economic disruption which could occur with a sudden and substantially higher levy. According to the Department of Transportation. the annual consumption of fuel by waterway users is roughly 1 billion gallons. Therefore. my bill would raise $50 million in the first year. This would recoup about 30 percent of the $158 million of operation. maintenance. and rehabilitation cost expended by the Corps of Engineers in 1974 for the shallow draftup to 12foot channel--system. Mr. Speaker. this tax would build upon the policy announced by the U.S. Water Resources Council to establish principles and standards for guiding Federal participation in planning the use of the Nations water and related resources. One of those principles is that ""reimbursement and costsharing policies shall be directed generally to the end that identifiable beneficiaries bare an equitable share of cost commensurate with beneficial effects."" Imposition of a 5cent fuel tax for commercial barge transportation would be a reasonable first step toward fulfillment of these principles and standards. It would hasten the establishment of a national policy with more balanced Federal financial support among the competing modes of commercial transportation. instead of continuing the unjustifiable policy of favoring just one mode as we have since 1787.\n'",finance entire cost develop maintain inland_waterway permit free use commerce recreation free use prove effective waterway use expand point

If she chooses to pursue higher education. a woman must face discriminatory college admissions policies. She will be less likely to receive fellowships and scholarships than her male counterpart. And once she has graduated from college. a woman can expect to earn only as much as a man with an eighth grade education. The following facts are a national disgrace. a bitter truth which must be confronted and challenged: While 70 percent of all public school teachers are women. in 1966 only two women served as superintendents in the Nations 13.000 school districts. Only 9 percent of all full professors are women. and they earn from $500 to $1.000 per year less than male professors. The proportion of women attending graduate schools today is less than in 1930. Women are only 6 percent of all engineering students. and 8 percent of all medical students. Women possess the same brainpower and innate abilities as men but are not allowed to use them fully. We cannot afford to continue to waste our enormous fund of female talent and experience. Let us begin nowby declaring a firm commitment to ending sex discrimination in our Nations educational facilities. This weeks issue of Science contains two excellent pieces on disrimination against women in our academic institutions and weak. ineffective tools the Federal Government is using to combat it.

House Joint Resolution 412 is the large continuing resolution. They separated Labor and HEW. making it House Joint Resolution 413. House Joint Resolution 412 is the large continuing resolution for all departments which do not have a public law. The House version of House Joint Resolution 412 does the following: It has a 5.5percent pay raise for executive pay level employees and for Members of Congress. a $500 million cut in travel funds. The abortion language is last years compromise for defense. It deletes the LaborHEW section. It includes railroad language which allows the ICC to operate at the Housepassed level of the transportation bill. It funds agencies at the lower of the House or the Senate level. There are some exceptions. It expires on November 20. What the House tried to do is just what they tried to do last year. but were unsuccessful. They would treat Defense differently than HEW. They are agreeing that more abortions here and overseas are all right for Defense people. but here at home. for poor people they are not. Basically. the committee recommends the same thing that was adopted by a vote of 77 to 9 nearly 2 weeks ago in House Joint Resolution 402. It deletes any pay raise for Members. makes a $750 million travel cut. adopts last years compromise abortion language. and ends November 20. which. incidentally. the House agreed to.

We in western New York have long maintained that price and quality should become the criteria for the expenditure of our Nations defense dollars and it is heartening. indeed. to learn that such views are shared in the State which has received the largest share of defense work. We have never questioned the premise that national security must be the overriding consideration. that defense business should go to the companies which have demonstrated that they can contribute. that they can produce. While we obviously are in complete agreement as to the basis on which defense contracts should be awarded. I must take exception to your stated concern that any decrease in Californias defense business ""could seriously negate the progress the United States has made to date."" No State or any group of States has a patent on quality. economy. and production. New York State. for instance. has excellent resources for outstanding engineers and scientists and highly dedicated and competent executive personnel. Modern equipment for research and extensive production facilities are available for the development and manufacture of space age products. Western New York. in particular. has compiled a remarkable record of industrial and scientific achievement In times of war and peace. The free enterprise system precludes the award of a disproportionate share of defense business to any one State or industrial complex and I know you will agree that our traditionally competitive way of doing business will provide the best defense possible. The defense industries of New York State accept fair and open competition as their guiding principle and will be Judged on this basis.

Mr. Chairman. the slogan of a very famous. now defunct. television show was: To boldly go where no man has gone before. The proponents of the supercollider program want us to believe that the enactment of this peculiar science project. targeted by the Department of Energy for a cost of more than $4 billion. but which we are told by the Congressional Budget Office is in excess of $6 billion. will lead us to heretofore unknown horizons and opportunities in science research. But Just as canceling Star Trek sent chills down the spines of its fans. talk about going slower in the pursuit of superconducting super collider sends chills down the backs of the proponents of the SSC. Basically. building the super collider would be a super mistake. It is proposed that we put all of our research eggs in one 53mile research basket as large as the Capital Beltway that surrounds this Nations Capital. Mr. Chairman. in todays Washington Post. Secretary of Energy Watkins said ""I find the Energy Department a culture of mismanagement and ineptitude."" Mr. Chairman. it is this same culture of mismanagement and ineptitude to which we now want to turn over the expenditures of between $4 billion and $6 billion of taxpayers money in a program that may leave this Federal Government with yet another white elephant. Joined by my colleagues. the gentleman from Wisconsin . the gentlemen from New York . and the gentleman from [Mr. WoLPlF. we want to underscore for our colleagues that this is the first vote in what will probably be a series of votes on determining the science priorities of this Nation. Currently we appropriate a little more than $1 billion in general sciences. $200 million of which will be taken by this project. Our amendment urges the continuation of research and development on the super collider but cuts the $110 million scheduled to initiate construction. For. as the committee tells us. this small $200 million down payment to build the Texas super collider grows to $900 million next year on a science budget only slightly bigger than that. Something has to give. A fudge factor that DOE tells us can cost this project more than 21 percent in cost overruns leaves us with the question of how will we fund other important science. projects. And after we are through building the super collider. it becomes a gift that keeps on giving. costing between $400 million and $550 million a year to operate. Over its lifetime. the superconductIng supercollider could cost as much as $12 billion. At a time of $150 billion budget deficits and a $150 billion savings and loan bailout and $100 billion Department of Energy environmental cleanup. where does this dollar drain end? We were told. and this House voted just about 1 year ago. that a third of the funding for the SSC should come from foreign governments. Yet in 6 years of advancing this project. we have not a single written commitment for a single foreign dollar to participate in it. In fact. the country of India has only made a verbal commitment for a paltry sum. most of which they vould like to see In inkind services. Yes. the State of Texas has committed a billion dollars. and for that we Ehould be greatfuL But would they not rather see us invest this money in enhanced energy recovery resources to directly stimulate their economy and not indirectly create more pork for the plains of Texas? The absence of substantial foreign commitments dooms this project to failure. for the foreigners will want to purchase only the best technology. not the least construction. A preoccupation with big science over little science will prevent the funding of 10.000 National Science Foundation grants covering a wide variety of investments in the science and education infrastructure of this Nation. Mr. Chairman. there are significant technical problems here. The 55foot prototype magnets have selfdestructed because the energy they create is beyond their physical ability to sustaih themselves. This will result in having to construct 10.000 of these magnets using a superconductivity technology that may be obsolete before this ring is built. The economics. the trickledown effect of this program Is one that should not be lost on us all. The super collider. as a super mistake. will deny the ability to fund those projects which make a difference. We were told in testimony and public commentary: We will squeeze out important investments in biomedical research. superconductivity. photonics. highdensity semiconductor integration and Interconnection. structural composites. fossil fuel recovery. alternative energy resources. factory automation. We will cut back ultimately on National Institutes of Health grants. nuclear medicine. artificial Intelligence. and applied science that can. if we are willing to make that much smaller investment in the science infrastructure of this Nation. bring greater investment and opportunities than some pieinthesky opportunity that will allow a few physicists the opportunity to elbow each other after spending $12 billion of your dollars and say. See. I told you so."" Mr. Chairman. the ability of this Congress to choose its priorities is not lost on us all. Other of my colleagues will speak upon the priorities of this Nation that should be significantly different. My colleague from Wisconsin will talk at length about the ability of this Congress to stand up and say. ""If you want these expensive new toys. lets pay for them."" Just a few weeks ago this House took an important vote on the transfer of important technology to Japan and the sale and the codevelopment of the FSX fighter. A majority of Members agree that important technology ought to stay here. Our allies ought not to be given it. We ought to develop this American program for America. using American taxpayers dollars. Yet we get no help. much In the same way our foreign allies rob Americans every single day by not paying their fair share of their defense burden. they refuse to come forward and participate in this program. hoping. once again. that Uncle Sam will be Uncle Sucker. If this project is so good. why are they not doing it? Because tile fact of the matter rnualus that the development of the superconducting super collider will have America eating its science seed corn. When we should be planting it and investing in alternative science programs. we will be putting all our eggs in a 53mile circular basket. a basket of obsolete technology. a bottomless pit that will take from this House and from the taxpayers of America an unlimited amount of resources. and will give 3 percent of Americas scientists 90 percent of Americas science budget. That is wrong. Captain Kirk and Mr. Spock could not save the Starship Enterprise. I do not think this House should save the superconducting super collider. BuildIng it would be a super mistake. I urge my colleagues to go forward with research and development. Let Members look at the opportunity that may come from this. However. let Members reserve judgment until the Department of Energy demonstrates some common sense: Commitment to cost management and a willingness and an understanding of the complex interrelationship between these kinds of projects and the environment they have so cavalierly trampled upon the last 10 years.

I move to strike out the last word. Mr. Chairman. I know that everyone in this House is deeply concerned about the defense of our country and maintaining the preeminent position of the United States throughout the world. However. very little has been said about one aspect of our position in this world today. We can very easily become a secondrate power. not through letting down on our military defense. but by letting down in our responsibilities in the fiscal area. Permit me to say that it is not idle gossip to think that the dollar might be devalued. Indeed. if we continue on this course of deficit financing that can well come about. In fact. some advisers close to the President have already suggested that this might be the course. I say we have to get into the expenditure side of the budget. We have got to think in terms of what can we afford. Up to the present time there has been very little attention devoted to that in the debate. I might say that it has been very difficult to even follow what the Committee on Armed Services has presented to us. The some 1.300 pages of printed hearings are not even indexed so that the Members of the House can follow with some intelligence what might be in this bill. The entire time for debate has been absorbed by the members of this committee. with very little explanation to the Members of the House. I might state. in the way of where this money might be spent. The committees written report deals with two areas of controversy both increasing the overall $15 billion authorization sought in this bill. What about the base $15 billion? We are distracted by the discussion over the $500 million increases. Permit me to relate this to our fiscal picture. We had an $81 billion expenditure rate the yea.r before President Kennedy came into office. The first year he was in office that expenditure rate went up to $87 billion. This year it is going to be $94 or $95 billion. The Presidents projected expenditure rate for the next fiscal year is $99 billion. This is an $18 billion increase in the space of 3 years compared tojust as a comparisonthe previous 6 years of an increase of $13 billion. Mr. Chairman. the Presidents proposal for tax reductionsand heaven knows we need them because our tax structure is creating economic damagemust be in my judgment predicated upon expenditure reform. I have suggested that the expenditure rate must be kept to around $95 billion for the next 3 years. Mr. Chairman. the only way we can look into the future is to see what the proposals are in this present budget containing requests for new obligational authority. This is not expenditure. This is an authorization bill paving the way for new obligational authority. New obligational authority requests under the 1964 budget are $107 billion. Here is where the amount of this particular bill we have before us would be included. If we are going to hold this expenditure line for the future. we must deal. as the gentleman from Michigan pointed out. with all the three steps in the appropriations process. We must look at each step. the first step being authorization like this bill. then the new obligational authority. and then the expenditure rate. Let no one tell you here that the authorization to ask for new obligational authority we are talking about is money that is going to be spent largely in 1963 or 1964. It is projected on out into the years to come. Mr. Chairman. nowhere in the committee report. I might say. does the committee give us the carryover obligational authority voted from previous years that is unspent and some not even obligated so that we might be able to get the entire picture. I know the total budget figure. There will be $87 billion of obligational carryover as of June 30 of this year of which the military share will be the largest item. Then add to the $87 billion carryover the Presidents request for $107 billion new obligational authority and you will have the figure of $194 billion of authority to spend the President will have for fiscal year 1964. It is only the Presidents statement that he will actually spend only $99 billion in fiscal year 1964 leaving a carryover of $95 billion on June 30. 1964. The Congress. once it has voted authorization and appropriation has no control over the expenditure rate. this is the prerogative of the Executive. So we. the Congress. must get into this aspect of the expenditures. If we are to control spending. consider aggregate levels and the priorities of the components we must do so on authorization bills. such as this one. as well as on the appropriation bills. There is very little. I repeat. for the House to go on. contained in the committee report. One cannot get into the committee hearings with any clarity because there is no index for the 1.300 pages it contains. However. fortunately. there have been some studies made of this area in particular by experts in this field. as expert. I might say. as the members of the Committee on Armed Services who have failed in this instance to take the rest of the Members of the House into their confidence. On the basis of the outside studies. done by Members of the Houseif I am recognized for the purposeI am going to offer a motion to recommit to cut this particular authority to spend. this authorization bill. by 5 percent in the procurement section. except for U.S. naval torpedoes. and by 12.5 percent in the research and development area. This will amount to a total cut of approximately $800 million. This will not cut the two committee amendments if adopted because under the rules of the House the motion to recommit with instructions cannot amend amendments. Let me say to my colleagues that if in your judgment we must have Federal expenditure reform. now is the time and place to begin. It does no good to put off the day of reckoning to say let us do the cutting elsewhere. and at another time. We can wait no longer. If we pursue the fiscal course we are pursuing--deficit financing on up to at least 1972 with an additional $75 billion of debt to market. the dollar will be devalued whatever may be our wishes. Then the United States will no longer be the preeminent nation in the world. we will no longer be the worlds banker. We will take our place still powerful. but no longer preeminent or the master of our destiny. along with other nations which once had their day of preeminence. Yes. we must talk in terms of military defense. But we must also talk in terms of economic strength from whence we derive our military strength. We have been debating neither military strength nor sound budgetsonly whether we should trust the judgment of a committee which shies away from debate and showing its studies and working papers whereby the House membership might evaluate the judgment. A recommittal motion is the only recourse open to those of us who feel expenditure reform is vital to our national security. I am satisfied that this kind of discipline is necessary. There is plenty of time in the event this cut happens to be in error in any detailand I do not like the acrosstheboard approach. but if this is in error in any detail although sound study reveals it is not. let me assure you that there is plenty of time to get into any detail of this matter to correct it. But if this Congress does not begin at this point. the beginning of the expenditure process to move in on the matter of this authority for new obligational authority. we have lost this first chance and all this talk against deficit financing and for balanced budgets will be idle.\n',object move strike last word know concerned defense country maintain preeminent position world little say aspect position world today become secondrate power let military defense let responsibility fiscal area permit say idle_gossip think dollar devalue continue course deficit financing come fact adviser close suggest course say get expenditure side budget get think term afford present time little attention devote debate say difficult follow present page print hearing index follow intelligence bill entire time debate absorb member committee little explanation member state way money spend committee write report deal area controversy increase overall authorization seek bill base distract discussion increase permit relate fiscal picture expenditure rate yea.r come office first year office expenditure rate go year go project expenditure rate next fiscal year increase space year compare tojust comparisonthe previous year increase proposal know need tax structure create economic damagemust judgment predicate expenditure reform suggest expenditure rate keep next year only way look future see proposal present budget contain request new obligational_authority expenditure authorization bill pave_way new obligational_authority new obligational_authority request budget amount particular bill include go hold expenditure line future deal gentleman point step appropriation process look step first step authorization bill new obligational_authority expenditure rate let one tell authorization ask new obligational_authority talk money go spend project year come committee report say committee give carryover obligational_authority vote previous year unspent obligate able get entire picture know total budget figure obligational carryover year military share large item add request new obligational_authority figure authority spend fiscal year statement spend fiscal year leave carryover vote authorization appropriation control expenditure rate prerogative get aspect expenditure control spending consider aggregate level priority component authorization bill such one appropriation bill little repeat go contain committee report get committee hearing clarity index page contain study make area particular expert field expert say member fail instance take rest confidence basis outside study do member recognize go offer motion_recommit cut particular authority spend authorization bill percent procurement section naval torpedo percent research development area amount total cut cut committee amendment adopt rule motion_recommit instruction amend amendment let say colleague judgment federal expenditure reform time place begin good put day_reckoning say let cutting time wait pursue fiscal course pursue deficit financing least additional debt market dollar devalue wish preeminent nation world world banker take place powerful preeminent master destiny other nation day preeminence talk term military defense talk term economic strength whence_derive military strength debate military strength sound trust judgment committee shy debate show study work paper membership evaluate judgment recommittal_motion only recourse open feel expenditure reform vital national security satisfied kind discipline necessary plenty time event cut happen error detailand like acrosstheboard approach error detail sound study reveal let assure plenty time get detail matter correct begin point beginning expenditure process move matter authority new obligational_authority lose first chance talk deficit financing balanced_budget idle.\n,88.0,bound,1,0

I reluctantly support this bill. not because I think it is a comprehensive energy package. but I think on the basis of the way it now stands. especially when added to the bill soon to come out of the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce. that it is needed. Mr. Chairman. I shall vote for H.R. 6860. the Energy Conservation and Conversion Act. with deep reluctance. This is a bad bill. a bill deprived of its raison detre with the elimination of the gasoline tax provisiona provision so inequitable that it was voted down 345 to 72. It is an incomprehensible bill that seeks to deal with a complex problem of great magnitude through the unsatisfactory vehicle of tax legislation. I am giving my support to it only because I understand that the Committee on Commerce and Health has almost finished its work on a comprehensive energy package. but cannot bring it to the floor of the House while our interest and our time are being preempted by H.R. 6860. Since the inception of what became known as the ""energy crisis"" Congress has twice attempted to come to grips with the problem and twice its attempts ended in routs and debacles. I am convinced that this can be blamed to a large extent on the fact that in both instances Congress attempted to solve the energy crisis through tax legislationeven as the administration continues to try to deal with it on the level of tariffs. Yet our energy crisis is not a crisis of taxation. It is a crisis of resources. conservation. development. and economics. Yet to date. in attempting to formulate a response to this very serious crisis. Congress has consistently left unexplored these aspects of the situation. I do not know what the Commerce Committee bill contains. Hopefully it addresses itself to the overall implications of the problem. If it does. it may still be possible to salvage matters by adapting both measures through conference action and utilize one to.complement the other. By doing so. Congress may yet arrive at an acceptable solution to our problems. Unfortunately. and realistically. this is almost too much to hope for. It is my conviction that because of the very complexity of the problem. no one committee of Congress is presently equipped to deal with the situation. I think we must give serious consideration to the establishment of a Select Committee on Energy to deal with this matter. A select committee. which could have a Senate counterpart. could move with speed. precision. and in a comprehensive manner. The membership for such a committee should be recruited from all legislative committees whose areas of jurisdiction and expertise bear on the energy problem. Its membership could include representatives from Ways and Means. whose expertise on taxation would help us to arrive at a reasonable rate of taxation for producers and consumers alike. Commerce and Health. whose members could advise us on the regulations of energy and could aid us with their knowledge of the problems of pricing and allocation. the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy whose experience with nuclear reactors would be extremely valuable. Science and Technology. whose members presently concern themselves with research and development in this area. Education and Labor. who could contribute their understanding of related labor problems. Interior and Insular Affairs. who could help us to achieve the fullest possible protection of our environmental resources. Foreign Affairs who. because of their familiarity with international trade policy could aid us in handling the problems posed by trade policies of the oil exporting nations. Government Operations. whose members could contribute their expertise on governmental structure. reorganization. and operations and thus help us arrive at a decision about the administrative structure necessary to handle these issues. Small Business. whose members would help us to protect small businessmen from the economic impact of the energy crisis. Transportation and Public Works. whose members familiarity with the needs of the transportation industry. both as a user and a mover of energy. should be of tremendous help.

I am very anxious that this resolution should be voted upon before 1 oclock. but I think I ought to take the time of the Senate to say that it is my belief. with all due respect to the chairman of the committee. that the committee. of which I am myself a member. should be discharged from the further consideration of the bill. and the Senate should now vote upon it. It is not a bill to tie directors in front of the locomotives. and it is not a bill about car couplers or automatic brakes. It is something very simple. It is a bill which provides that when there is an accident the railroad managers shall make a report as to the causes of the accident. and there is a provision in the bill that the report shall never be used in a suit against the railroad company or any person for damages. Now. what is the harm in that bill? None whatever. Mr. President. and it does not need to be amended in order that we may run the risk of having it embargoed and defeated in the House of Representatives. The members of the Committee on Interstate Commerce have been engaged in many other things this winter. and we have not been able to get the bill reported. but the other day the chairman. thinking he had a majority of the committee polled in favor of the bill. reported it. Subsequently. finding a mistake had been made. he had it recommitted. and we have tried to get a meeting since. At a meeting called for day before yesterday or yesterday there was no one present but the chairman and the Senator from South Carolina and myself. No one else would come. not that they stayed away on purpose. The Senator from Rhode Island was very busy upon an important bill. the Senator from West Virginia was equally busy in the public service. and they did not come. Now. Mr. President. what is the harm in taking the bill out of the committee and voting on it? What is the harm. I ask the chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary. in taking the antitrust bill out of that committee. where there is so much division of opinion. and bringing it befure the Senate. when it is a House bill?

I rise today to discuss several issues of importance to the future of our Nations military. The National Defense Authorization Act before us this year will affect the size and strength of the U.S. Armed Forces and the resources and programs available to our service members and their families. According to GEN Martin Dempsey. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. ""capability is more important than size."" As the size of our military begins to decrease. there is more need than ever to ensure that they have the right equipment to fulfill their missions. Therefore. I am pleased that the committee has given the Pentagon the authority through this bill to negotiate multiyear procurements for the militarys workhorse. the CH47 Chinook. and for the V22 Osprey and the unique capabilities it brings to the field. I also want to note my frustration with the Armys lack of strategic and longterm thinking related to armored combat vehicles. The Armys desire to temporarily cease production of tanks and Bradley fighting vehicles without longterm plans as to what will replace them is nonsense. These proposals. should they be approved. jeopardize the Nations combat vehicle industrial base. our national security and the livelihoods of many individuals throughout the Nation. Small businesses are the backbone of the economy both in Pennsylvania and across the Nation. Given their importance. I am committed to advocating for the needs of businesses. particularly women and minority business enterprises. in the U.S. Senate. My amendment. No. 2986. would ensure that subcontractors are aware of their inclusion on bids for Federal contracts and establish a system to report fraudulent procurement practices. In order to secure government contracts. big companies routinely list small businesses as subcontractors on their bids in order to strengthen their applications without the intention of actually giving the work to the named subcontractor. This especially happens with women and minority owned businesses. Currently. there is no legal requirement to notify subcontractors of their inclusion on Federal bids and no way to report this. This is taking business away from hard working men and women and it is time for this fraudulent activity to end. Amendment No. 2986 would prohibit prime contractors from using small businesses as straw men to win government bids. First. it would require that subcontractors identified on a solicitation for a competitive proposal are notified by the prime contractor before the application is submitted. Second. it would establish a reporting mechanism that allows subcontractors to report any fraudulent activity. This amendment is in direct response to concerns raised by my constituents. Alexander Nicholas of the Western Pennsylvania Minority Supplier Development Council. and Craig Bingham. owner of DCI Logistics in Carnegie. PA. I ask my colleagues to join me in support for promoting transparency and accountability in Federal procurement processes and support amendment No. 2986. Another longterm objective that the Nation and our military must recognize is the need for a secure and reliable source of strategic materials. such as rare earths. In filing amendment No. 2994 to the fiscal year 2013 National Defense Authorization Act. I want the Department of Defense to conduct a costbenefit analysis on the feasibility of recycling heavy rare earth elements from fluorescent lighting waste. New innovations by Pennsylvanian businesses have taken the theory of recycling rare earths and made it a reality. With China controlling 95 percent of the world supply of rare earth elements. the United States must look at methods. including the recycling of products. to increase our domestic supply of rare earths. Investing in alternative fuels and energy technology is also critical to sustaining our national defense capabilities in the 21st century. DOD is the largest single user of oil in the world and their fuel bill was more than $17 billion in fiscal year 2011. DOD recognizes that this type of expenditure. not to mention where we have to go in the world to get that oil. is unsustainable. That is why they began investing in alternative fuels and energy technology under Secretary Rumsfeld back in the early 2000s. I think it would be a mistake to disinvest in that effort now when the return on investment could be so beneficial to our country. As they are currently written. sections 313 and 2823 of the NDAA put unnecessary restrictions on our militarys ability to invest in alternative fuels. which could prove harmful to our national defense capabilities and our economy by keeping our military dependent on imported fossil fuels. I think it is very important that we fix sections 313 and 2823 with Senator UDALLS amendment 2985 and Senator HAGANS amendment 3095. respectively. Currently. DOD invests only a small portion of their budget in alternative fuel development but this is an important investment for American businesses that focus on alternative fuel development and energy technology research. Therefore. our Nation benefits three times from the fruits of these investments: once by improving our national defense capabilities. a second time by supporting jobs in the energy research and development sector. and again because these innovations can be applied in the marketplace benefiting all Americans. It is a smart investment to keep our military strong and develop 21st century energy solutions that we can use here and export abroad. Therefore. I support my colleagues amendments to strike sections 313 and 2823 from the NDAA. Lastly. we must take care of the military families who continue to sacrifice without complaint. As chairman of the Joint Economic Committee. I studied the economic effects that the military lifestyle has on the earnings of military spouses. In 2010. the unemployment rate for military wives was 15.0 percent compared to 7.3 percent for civilian wives. One cause of this disparity may have to do with the numerous relocations military families undergo. In this same time period. 24.1 percent of military wives moved across State lines. compared with only 2.4 percent of civilian wives. Frequent moves coupled with military spouses holding jobs that require Statelevel relicensing create barriers that spouses must overcome when seeking employment. Therefore. I introduced S. 697. the Military Spouse Job Continuity Act. which would provide a $500 tax credit for military spouses who need to renew or transfer their professional licenses or certifications due to military relocations. While this specific bill cannot be taken up today for procedural reasons. I ask my colleagues to join me in a senseoftheSenate amendment recognizing that we must work with the Pentagon and State and local governments to reduce the employment barriers for military spouses. without whom we would not have the superb military we have today. I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting these important amendments.\n'",rise today discuss several issue importance future military year affect size strength resource program available service member family accord capability important size size military begin decrease more need ensure right equipment fulfill mission pleased committee give authority bill negotiate multiyear_procurement military workhorse unique capability bring field want note frustration lack strategic longterm thinking relate armored combat vehicle desire cease production tank_bradley fighting vehicle longterm plan replace nonsense proposal approve jeopardize combat vehicle industrial base national security livelihood many individual nation small business backbone economy nation give importance committed advocate need business woman minority business enterprise amendment ensure subcontractor aware inclusion bid federal contract establish system report fraudulent procurement practice order secure government contract big company list small business subcontractor bid order strengthen application intention give work name subcontractor happen woman minority own business legal requirement notify subcontractor inclusion federal bid way report take business hard work man woman time fraudulent activity end amendment no prohibit prime_contractor use small business straw man win government bid require subcontractor identify solicitation competitive proposal notify prime_contractor application submit establish reporting mechanism allow subcontractor report fraudulent activity amendment direct response concern raise constituent owner ask colleague join support promote transparency_accountability federal procurement process support amendment no longterm objective military recognize need secure reliable source strategic material such rare earth filing amendment no fiscal year want conduct costbenefit_analysis feasibility recycle heavy rare earth element fluorescent_lighting waste new innovation pennsylvanian business take theory recycle rare earth make reality control percent world supply rare earth element look method include recycling product increase domestic supply rare earth invest alternative fuel energy technology critical sustain national defense capability 21st_century large single user oil world fuel bill more fiscal year recognize type expenditure mention go world get oil unsustainable begin invest alternative fuel energy technology early think mistake disinvest effort return investment beneficial country write section put unnecessary restriction military ability invest alternative fuel prove harmful national defense capability economy keep military dependent import fossil_fuel think important fix section amendment amendment invest small portion budget alternative fuel development important investment american business focus alternative fuel development energy technology research benefit time fruit investment improve national defense capability second time support job energy research development sector innovation apply marketplace benefit smart investment keep military strong develop 21st_century energy solution use export support colleague amendment strike section take care military family continue sacrifice complaint chairman study economic effect military lifestyle earning military spouse unemployment rate military wife percent compare percent civilian wife cause disparity numerous relocation military family undergo same time period percent military wife move line compare percent civilian wife frequent move couple military spouse hold job require relicense create barrier spouse overcome seek employment introduce provide tax credit military spouse need renew transfer professional license certification military relocation specific bill take today procedural reason ask colleague join senseofthesenate amendment recognize work local government reduce employment barrier military spouse superb military today ask colleague join support important amendments.\n,112.0,daily,0,1

But I wish to urge upon the committee the necessity and importance of this work situated in my own State. with the wants and necessities of which I am familiar. I do not object to this bill because ""ib appropriates too much money. I base my objections to it upon the fact that it has not discriminated in favor of the important works. and has made appropriations. large appropriations. for what in my j adgmont are unimportant works. My idea of the duties devolving upon the Committee on Commerce is that they should take into consideration first the question as to what is absolutely necessary for the improvement of a certain river or harbor. and what are the obstructions which have to be removed in the interest of commerce. The next question to be considered should be the importanct and the amount of commerce carried upon the river or entering the hrbor. I speak. Mr. Chairman. in behalf of Oakland Harbor. a portion of the bay of San Francisco. Oakland Harbor is on the east side of the bay of San Francisco. The Government has already appropriated some two hundred and fifty thousand dollars or more for the improvement of this harbor to which is brought the commerce of the Asiatic countries. and of the whole interior portion of my Sate. The people in the great producing valleys of the Sacramento and the San Joaquin find that Oakland Harbor is the point from which the wheat produced in the State should be shipped to foreign markets. And the commerce coming from China and Japan by sea ought to be landed at the Oakland wharf for reshipment over the great overland highway of the country. Oakland is the terminal point of the two great transcontinental railroads. My amendment is to appropriate $100.000 instead of $60.000 for the purpose of continuing this improvement. The State of California. let me say to the committee. is entitled to some little consideration. I find upon consulting the records and the statistics that the bay and the harbor of San Francisco. of which this improvement is a part. in the amount of money collected as custom duties is the fourth harbor in the United States. only three other ports collecting more than is collected at the harbor and port of San Francisco. I find that in the payment of internal revenue California stands ninth on the list of States. only eight States paying more than California pays into the Treasury of the United States. In the Public Lands Department California pays more money into the Treasury than any other State. In point of tonnage it is the third of all the States in the Union. It is this harbor which must receive the commerce of Asia. There is not a port more important. not only to the Pacific coast but to the entire country. The tea and coffee shipped.from foreign ports ought to have their reshipment from this harbor. We propose to remove the obstructions that are there.

If passage did not occur for some time we would be in an embarrassing position. Therefore. since the very beginning I have been calling for a final draft of proposed implementing legislation. We were assured last fall that we would get that implementing legislation. Then later on down the road. I was told that the reason we were not going to get the implementing legislation was because the House did not want to consider action on it at this time. That is not our concern. That is the concern of the House of Representatives. I cannot conceive of why the House did not want to even look at it at that time. At some time in the near future it may have to take action on implementing legislation or the treaties are not going to be worth very much. Obviously. we would not have necessary appropriations for one thing. which would be essential. or any of the other items which would be contained in the implementing legislation. Then a little further down the road the administration said: Well. we will send you the proposed implementing legislation. but it will be subject to revision. We do not stand on it as we will send it up to you. Well. it is not very reassuring. for the administration to say.

I also want to recognize the importance of this debate that we are having here tonight to point out where we are in Iraq. to salute our men and women in uniform. arid to really set the record straight. As the gentleman from Kentucky has said. there has been much rhetoric tonight in this Chamber and throughout the last couple of months aimed at the Presidents policies and our policies. the American policies in Iraq. And. in fact. it is those policies that I think represent a bold approach to safety for the citizens of this country. They are also a bold approach which represents and reflects an awareness that we must act in this country. in a new world and a new paradigm. against an enemy the likes of which we really have not seen before. It is this socalled Bush doctrine that takes a very courageous stand against the terrorists and says that we will never. ever condone the killing of innocent people. It is that sense of moral clarity that governs the actions of this administration. and I salute this President fot his strength and his courage. But I think there are some important points that we ought to make this evening. an evening that is just 1 day after the 1year anniversary of the return of sovereignty to Iraq. A few points I would like to make are. number one. we must fight the terrorists abroad. otherwise the terrorists will strike us here at home. And thank God. Mr. Speaker. for the men and women in uniform who have sacrificed so much to go over there to defend our liberty that we may enjoy here while they are abroad. I salute them and I salute their families for what they do for all of us here in America. Secondly. our mission in Iraq is clear: we must help Iraqis build a free nation. strong enough to defend itself and also to advance freedom in the broader Middle East. This. Mr. Speaker. will make us more secure here at home by closing yet another potential terrorist outpost around the world. Mr. Speaker. it is this notion. that we must seek out the threat and go after it before it comes after us. that this President has pursued. That is our mission in Iraq. That. unfortunately. is what the other side of the aisle has consistently condemned this President for. -the strength and courage that he has exhibited. Thirdly. Mr. Speaker. I would say that the sacrifice that our troops make. the sacrifice that their families make is difficult and often painful. But. clearly. Mr. Speaker. their efforts and their sacrifice are worth enduring because it is that sacrifice that lays the foundation for peace for our children and our grandchildren and the future generations of this country. Fourth. I would say that our soldiers. sailors. airmen and Marines serve with pride. They serve with pride and honor despite the attacks. despite what I call the irresponsible rhetoric that has come from many of the leaders on the .other side of the aisle in this body and others questioning the sense or the wisdom of our mission in Iraq. Once this mission has taken place. once we have gone over to Iraq. the mission the President has set out is very clear. We are there. The exit strategy is for the Iraqi soldiers. the Iraqi security forces to be in place. to be able to defend that country. That is when we will leave. These young men and women have fought bravely. and they deserve our respect and certainly our honor. I would like at this time to bring to Members attention a letter from one of my constituents currently serving in Iraq. I think it demonstrates really the sense of pride that is felt by our young men and women in uniform. Marine Corps Captain Matthew James Markham is an .F18 fighter pilot. He. wrote to me recently. ""I am about to begin my fifth month of deployment to the Al Anbar province of Iraq. where I am serving as a pilot with the Fighting Bengals. an F18 Marine Fighter Attack Squadron. Our squadron was here for the election. and I was proud to be piloting a Hornet over Baghdad on that historic day. Since then. we have provided overwatch for many convoys. directed cordon and searches. located and destroyed enemy mortar sites. and provided air cover for. many special operations forces raids. While all these jobs are important. nothing has excited us more than to see the increased role the Iraqi security forces and Iraqi defense forces -have been providing in defending this young democracy. ""Morale among our individual Marines remains high. I am amazed how enthusiastically our Marines perform their jobs despite the intense heat and long hours. and I am honored to lead such individuals."" Mr. Speaker.

I want to cite the Supreme Court in the United States versus Mississippi Tax Commission.

Then. again in 1983. the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. in a case involving Texas. held States cannot regulate where military services purchase alcohol. They could not require InState purchase which would have permitted indirect taxation on the United States when direct taxation was held uncoristitutional under Mississippi law. Mr. President. when it was first proposed one of the arguments was that the amendment would help reduce alcohol consumption. I can tell you. Mr. President. this is not true. It is not a healthrelated amendment. It is pure and simple.

I will try and take considerably less than 30 minutes. I shall be very brief. We have a conference report that was agreed to by all conferees on the part of the Committee on Education and Labor. There were two other aspects. one of which it touches on the Committee on the JudiLs ciary. It was agreed to by all conferees e and also the Committee on Ways and d Means. Again it was agreed to by all conLt ferees. .s On the detailed portions of the conir ference report the Senate went with the n House on all the major suggestions made e by my colleague. the gentleman from 11 Colorado. Mr. KRAMER. and my colleague. v the gentleman from Ohio. Mr. ASHBROOK. s I think we have a solid piece of legislation here. I hope it will be supported by the House. f I ask my colleagues support for the t conference report on H.R. 2977. the r Domestic Violence Prevention and Servd ices Act. This legislation received overwhelming support as it passed the House in December of 1979. I assure my colleagues that the conference report is in virtually all respects. as to the sections on domestic violence. reflective of the House provisions that were carefully drafted with bipartisan participation. In particular the conference report maintains the House intention that this program not be openended. but expire in 3 years. and maintains the House intention that the program be channeled exclusively through State government rather than through direct grants from the Federal Government. The important concept of local initiative and incentives for continued State and local support of programs funded under this act is maintained in a provision that requires grantees to provide an increasing local share in proportion to the total Federal funds received. Federal funds from any source are not permitted to meet the local share and 50 percent of the local share must be raised from private sources (which may be in cash or in kind) in the community to be served. Thus Federal funds will be used to stimulate State and local solutions to the problem of domestic violence. This domestic violence legislation has the support of the administration and a long list of diverse organizations including the Congresswomens Caucus. the General Federation of Womens Clubs. the YWCA. the American Jewish Congress. the National Council of Churches. the American Nurses Association. the American Bar Association. and t the International Brotherhood of Police c Officers. It merits the continued support of the House. as well. and I urge prompt passage of this conference report. Mr. Speaker. the Senate added to the bill H.R. 2977 a number of additional v amendments during its consideration. 0 The conferees acted upon them as fol- a lows: Title II of the Senate bill established t] a Presidential Commission on National Service. The House bill did not contain h a comparable provision. but a similar Commission would be established by g H.R. 6868. ordered reported by my Sub- L committee on Select Education on September 3. 1980 and by the Education and S Labor Committee on September 23. 1980. c As H.R. 6868 was jointly referred to the a House Armed Services Committee. how- P ever. the Senate receded in view of that tc committees jurisdictional objections. I h would like to note that the chairman of the Armed Services Subcommittee on Military Personnel has assured me of his intention to move ahead rapidly on marking up H.R. 6868 and I encourage him to do so. Title III of the Senate bill provided for the Secretary of HHS to conduct a study of the nature and incidence of abuse of elderly individuals. The conferees accepted this amendment in view of the testimony before the House Select Committee on Aging showing the potentially widespread nature of this primarily hidden problem. Title IV of the Senate bill contained provisions directed toward the serious problem of parental kidnaping. The House appointed as conferees. solely for this title. five members of the Judiciary Committee and three members of the Ways and Means Committee. These conferees agreed upon a compromise that would: First. provide that the appropriate authorities of every State inforce and not modify any child custody determination entered by a court of another State of jurisdiction. second. authorize the Secretary of HHS to enter into agreements with States for utilization of the Federal Parent Locator Service. limited to the mostrecent address and place of employment of any absent parent of the child. for the purpose of enforcing any State or Federal law with respect to unlawful taking or restraint of a child or enforcing a child custody determination. third. delete the provisions of the Senate amendment establishing a new Federal criminal offense and substitute a provision setting forth the congressional intent that section 1073 of title 18. United States Code. is aoplicable to cases involving parental kidnaping and interstate or international flight to avoid prosecution under applicable State felony statutes and requiring the Attorney General of the United States to submit to the Congress reports with respect to steps taken to comply with the intent of Congress. Title V of the Senate bill authorizes the extension of the Commission on Proposals for the National Academy on Peace and Conflict Resolution through January 31. 1981. Although funds were appropriated for the Commission in Ocober 1979. the Commission under the :hairmanship of Senator MATSUNAGA did not begin its formal activities until Janiary 1980. The intent of the original uthorizing legislation was to give the Uommission a full year for its work. title V will assure this.

I rise today to introduce two bills that would lay a strong foundation to improve the Federal acquisition system. The first bill. the Acquisition Workforce Improvement Act of 2011. S. 761. cosponsored by Senators AKAKA and MCCASKILL. would create a Federal acquisition management fellows program to develop a new generation of acquisition leaders with governmentwide perspective. skills. and experience. The second bill. the Federal Acquisition Institute Improvement Act of 2011. S. 762. cosponsored by Senators AKAKA. MCCASKILL and BROWN of Massachusetts. would provide muchneeded organizational clarity to enable the Federal Acquisition Institute (FAI) to fulfill its mission of facilitating career development and better management of the federal acquisition workforce. The Federal acquisition system is under tremendous stress. Between fiscal years 2000 and 2010. acquisition spending by the federal government expanded by 163 percent. from $205 billion to $535 billion. The necessary costs of military operations. natural disasters. homeland security precautions. and other vital programs will continue to strain the acquisition system in the years ahead. This unprecedented level of purchasing creates abundant opportunities for fraud. waste. and abuse. We have seen far too many outrageous failures in government contracting. The Secure Border Initiative Network. the Census Bureaus handheld computers for the 2010 Census. and the Marine Presidential Helicopter programs are among recent. notorious and costly acquisition failures. which we can ill afford. These and other failures demand strong steps to protect taxpayer dollars and deliver better acquisition outcomes. As a longtime advocate for stronger competition. accountability. and transparency in government contracting. I recognize the actions the Administration has taken recently to improve federal contracting. Many of these initiatives originated from legislation I coauthored with Senator LIEBERMAN during the 110th Congress. But. no matter how many laws we pass or guidance documents OMB issues. the effectiveness of our Federal acquisition system ultimately depends on a vital human componentthe acquisition workforce. While contract spending has risen dramatically. the number of acquisition professionals who help plan. award. and oversee these contracts has been stagnant. And with roughly half of the current acquisition workforce eligible to retire by 2018. the difficulties of strengthening that workforce are becoming increasingly acute. A welltrained and adequately sized acquisition workforce is critical to managing and overseeing federal spending and the increasingly complex procurements of services and goods. The two pieces of legislation I am introducing today are designed to address these important longterm goals. The Acquisition Workforce Improvement Act would create a centrally managed. Governmentwide Acquisition Management Fellows Program that combines both a Masters degreelevel academic curriculum and onthejob training in multiple federal agencies. By partnering with leading universities that have specialized government acquisition programs. the government can attract topcaliber students and retain our best government employees who are interested in pursuing both academic advancement and public service. Compared to the several existing. agencyspecific intern programs. this governmentwide program would provide a muchneeded skill set that we currently do not have in sufficient number. that is. acquisition professionals with multiagency and multidisciplinary training who can understand and manage governmentwide acquisition needs and perspectives. Considering that interagency acquisition now accounts for approximately 40 percent of the Federal Governments entire contract spending. and that GAO has designated the management of interagency contracting a highrisk area since 2005. it is evident that we need to develop future acquisition leaders who understand governmentwide needs and perspectives and are able to operate effectively outside of the traditional. singleagency environment. Specifically. the Acquisition Management Fellows Program would include one academic year of fulltime. oncampus training followed by 2 years of onthejob and parttime training toward a Masters or equivalent graduate degree in related fields. and a curriculum that would include rotational assignments at three or more executive agencies covering. among other issues. acquisition planning. costestimating. formation and postaward administration of ""high risk"" contract types. and interagency contracts. Upon graduation. participants will have completed all required. nonagencyspecific training courses necessary for a basic contracting officer warrant. In addition. participants would be required to enter into a service commitment to ensure the Federal Government receives a proper return on its investment. The service commitment would be no less than 1 year for each year a participant is in the program. and would require reimbursement of funds for those who do not successfully complete the program or do not fulfill the minimum service requirements. Our second bill. the Federal Acquisition Institute Improvement Act. would strengthen the Federal Acquisition Institute. FAI. whose key responsibilities are to promote career development and strategic human capital management for the entire civilian acquisition workforce. The FAI has remained largely underutilized due to a lack of organizational clarity. the disproportionate funding compared to its counterpart in the Department of Defense. and its intermittent use by a few Federal agencies. The proposed legislation would establish a clear line of responsibility and accountability for the Institute by requiring that FAI. through its Board of Directors. report directly to the Office of Federal Procurement Policy. OFPP. the director of FAI be appointed by the OFPP Administrator. and report directly to the OFPP Associate Administrator for Acquisition Workforce. all existing civilian agency training programs follow guidelines issued by OFPP. which would ensure consistent training standards necessary to develop uniform core competencies. and the OFPP Administrator report annually to Congressional committees of jurisdiction projected FAI budget needs and expense plans to fulfill its statutory mandate. With respect to its core governmentwide functions. FAI would be required to provide and keep current governmentwide training standards and certification requirements including ensuring effective agency implementation of governmentwide training and certification standards. analyzing the curriculum to ascertain if all certification competencies are covered. or if adjustments are necessary. developing careerpath information for certified professionals to encourage retention in government positions. and coordinating with the Office of Personnel Management for human capital efforts. The administration has identified acquisition workforce development as a pillar for improving acquisition practices and contract performance. While I fully agree with this goal. we need specific and concrete action to solve this problem. Our legislation would prompt the sustained effort necessary to rebuild the acquisition workforce. While this will take time and investment. I am confident this is a wise investment that will yield substantial returns. Just think about it: if our bettertrained acquisition professionals can prevent one failed procurement. it can save the taxpayer hundreds of millions of dollars. If they can avoid overpaying one percent of our contract spending. it will save the taxpayer more than five billion dollars each year. The numbers speak for themselves. The Acquisition Workforce Improvement Act and the Federal Acquisition Institute Improvement Act are critically needed and both enjoy bipartisan support. I encourage my colleagues to support them. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the RECORD.\n'",rise today introduce bill lay strong foundation improve federal acquisition system first bill cosponsor create acquisition management fellow program develop new generation acquisition leader governmentwide perspective skill experience second bill cosponsor provide muchneede organizational clarity enable fulfill mission facilitate career development well management federal acquisition workforce federal acquisition system tremendous stress fiscal year acquisition spending federal government expand percent necessary cost military operation natural_disaster homeland_security precaution other vital program continue strain acquisition system year unprecedented level purchasing create abundant opportunity fraud waste abuse see many outrageous failure government contracting handheld_computer program recent notorious costly acquisition failure ill afford other failure demand strong step protect taxpayer dollar deliver well acquisition outcome longtime advocate strong competition accountability_transparency government contracting recognize action take improve federal contracting many initiative originate legislation coauthore 110th many law pass guidance document omb issue effectiveness federal acquisition system depend vital human_componentthe acquisition workforce contract spending rise number acquisition professional help plan oversee contract stagnant half current acquisition workforce eligible retire difficulty strengthen workforce become acute welltrained sized acquisition workforce critical manage oversee federal spending complex procurement service good piece legislation introduce today design address important longterm goal create manage combine_degreelevel academic curriculum onthejob_training multiple federal agency partner lead university specialize government acquisition program government attract_topcaliber student retain good government employee interested pursue academic advancement public service compare several exist program governmentwide program provide muchneede skill set sufficient number acquisition professional multiagency_multidisciplinary training understand manage governmentwide acquisition need perspective consider interagency acquisition account percent entire contract spending designate management interagency contract highrisk area evident need develop future acquisition leader understand governmentwide need perspective able operate traditional environment include academic year fulltime_oncampus training follow year onthejob parttime training equivalent graduate degree relate field curriculum include rotational_assignment more executive agency cover other issue acquisition planning costestimate_formation postaward administration high risk contract type interagency contract graduation participant complete require_nonagencyspecific training course necessary basic contracting officer warrant addition participant require enter service commitment ensure receive proper return investment service commitment less year year participant program require reimbursement fund complete program fulfill minimum service requirement second bill strengthen key responsibility promote career development strategic human capital management entire civilian acquisition workforce fai remain underutilize lack organizational clarity disproportionate funding compare counterpart intermittent use few federal agency propose legislation establish clear line responsibility accountability require report director appoint report exist civilian agency training program follow guideline issue ensure consistent training standard necessary develop uniform core_competency report congressional committee jurisdiction project budget need expense plan fulfill statutory mandate respect core governmentwide function fai require provide keep current governmentwide training standard certification requirement include ensure effective agency implementation governmentwide training certification standard analyze curriculum ascertain certification competency cover adjustment necessary develop careerpath information certify professional encourage retention government position coordinate human capital effort administration identify acquisition workforce development pillar improve acquisition practice contract performance agree goal need specific concrete action solve problem legislation prompt sustained effort necessary rebuild acquisition workforce take time investment confident wise investment yield substantial return think bettertraine_acquisition professional prevent fail procurement save taxpayer hundred_million dollar avoid overpay percent contract spending save taxpayer more dollar year number speak need enjoy bipartisan support encourage colleague support ask_unanimous consent_text bill print_record.\n,112.0,daily,1,0

I have no disposition to enter into a lengthy argument on this question. I am not here as the defender of the commission. I have yielded my assent to this conference report because I am satisfied it is the best that can be gotten and is as much as the Senate would yield to. They will make no further concession. I yield in assenting to it many convictions which I have of what is right and what ought to have been done. The House bill originally passed embodied my views of what ought to be the law in the settlement of this matter. But the Senate has taken a different view of it. and I have surrendered my judgment of the full measure of justice to those people in deference to stern necessity and the anxious wish and prayer of the people of Hot Springs. who are interested more than any other people in this country in this matter. The story of their anxiety and unrest in the matter of their titles is an old story in this House and well known to everybody. They have been for thirtyyears on the ""rugged edge of apprehension"" as to the tenure of their lands. This bill. I frankly confess. is a hardship upon them. but they ask for it. They write to me and dispatch to me most piteous appeals to yield my judgment as to their rights and let this bill pass and deliver them from the suspense which destroys the happiness of their lives. They have built their homes there. It is the workmanship of their lifetime of toil. and they are constantly unsettled as to the tenure by which they hold their title. They were first delivered up to receivers and fleeced and skinned and disturbed as few people ever were. They were transferred from the hands of the receivers and delivered to the tender mercies of a commission which proceeded to handle them two years longer. swearing them. surveying them. changing their boundarylines. tearing down and removing their houses so that they did not knowwhen theylaid down at night whether they would have a roof over them in the morning. They were unhappy. They ask to be secured in what they believe. to be their rights. They ask to be delivered from receivers. commissioners. investigators. and from Congress and the courts. I ask this House to do this measure of justice to these people. I surrender my convictions of much of what I believe to be right. As to this certificate for $22.000 1 would not concede that. because I am convinced it is wrong in all its features and ought not to be paid. The simple history of that Arlington Hotel condemnation is this: The first condemnation was made during the firstyear of the administration of those commissioners and all the buildings were removed from thestreetsandfrom the reservation that were obstructions. The proprietors of the Arlington Hotel did not take a condemnation then. hut came to Congress at the end of that year and asked for the passage of the act of December. 1878. It was argued that their buildings were worth $100.000. and the Government ought not to pay for them. that it was too great asum toask the Government to pay. they asked that Government should rent them the ground upon whiehthe buildings stood and givothem alease of ten years and allow them to retain the ownership. The act was passed and the lease was entered into in pursuance of thisact inApril. 1879. Then. in December. 1879. before the term of the commission expired. they asked and obtained a condemnation for $22.000. They hold the building at a rent of $1.000 a year and they claim they will still hold it for ten years by virtue of the lease. and they ask the payment of this certificate also.

In the first place. the Senator has properly quoted the constitution of West Virginia. It Is true also that it has been properly quoted as it refers to the writ of habeas corpus. But it is also claimed that that provision of the constitution must in certain exigencies be construed with other provisions of the constitution. with decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States. and with that law that is higher than any statute. or any constitutionthe right of selfpreservation. the inherent power of any government to protect and save itself. It is not the first time by any means that such a proposition as that has been enunciated. but I hope to God it will be the last. I hope that no such conditions will ever exist either in West Virginia or in any other State of the Union that will render it essential to resort to such extreme measures. We might as well look the situation squarely in the face. we might as well appreciate the circumstances under which West Virginia was. and other States now are. suffering. we might as well concede that we are standing on the brink of a fearful precipice. the fall over which means certain deathdeath to the individual. death to the government. We iad better pause and take stock. we had better look at this trouble and other troubles. not in tie light that it will help here or help there to gain a vote here or lose a vote there. but if we want to preserve constitutional government on the face of the earth. we have got to properly handle these unusual strikes. riots. and insurrections. To show that I am not alone. that I am sounding no false chord. I beg leave to read and to incorporate in my remarks an editorial that was published in the New York World in its issue of May 16. It is headed. ""An issue that must be met."" just as I have been trying to present in my feeble wayan issue that must be met: Patrick Quinlan. of the I. W. W.. comes into collision with what used to be called Jersey justice. and is convicted at Paterson of ln~iting to assault. He may go to the penitentiary for years. Sympathy with labor and with those who seek to assist labor In its lawful purposes can hardly be extended to Quinlan. tie was an Intruder. He interfered in an industrial quarrel not as a coworker. not as a peacemaker. not as a negotiator. not even as a citizen. Like all the other members of the 1. W. W.. he appeared on the scene to promote trouble. to intensify anger. and to encourage violence. ie is facing the penalty of lawlessness. It: is not the authorities alone that show their bristles when the I. IV. W. appears. Every responsible labor organization in America manifests similar sentiments. Why? Because the misguided men who have launched this piratical craft upon the industrial sea are avowed enemies of peace. order. law. right. and justice. This editorial is not classifylig all labor organizations in that way. Their aim Is not to promote the Interests of those who work. It 11 to Inflict damage upon property. Injury upon those who employ labor. and contempt upon all those whose duty it is to enforce the law. That is the sentiment to which I alluded a few moments ago when I said that in a strike zone the people generally sympathize with the misguided and those conducting themselves illegally. With them labors Interests are always secondary. If this idea Is to prevail. we shall soon have no industry and no Government. no wages and no property. no rights and no justice. If there can be no common ground on which employers and employees can meet. peace is impossible and progress Is impossible. 1he I. W. W.s purpose is avowedly destructive. It is not satisfied merely with the destruction of Industry. It destroys property. It seeks to intimidate capital. It terrorizes labor. It entertains a grotesque theory that It can destroy government. A socalled labor organization that sacrifices labor to lawlessness. that never makes peace. that refuses to arbitrate. that teaches sedition and crime. that has no known objective but riot. and that carries in its pulpy hands no standard but that of license. certainly has no place in this Republic. No matter how many illadvised and illdisposed persons may foolishly yleld to the appeals of the leaders of the I. W. W.. the issue which they raise Is one that must be met unflinchingly. Rights and interests of labor and rights and interests of capital as such must be held in .tbeyance when the higher rights of society are menaced. Tie brawlers of this organization represent no legitimate interest. They are avowed wreckers. They have no habitation. Tiiy are engaged In no respectable Industry. They challenge law. They are nomads. Wherever they appear they provoke disorder. bloodshed. terror. They are not to be dignified with the title of rebels or revolutionists. They are desperadoes. and they should be dealt with as desperadoes. The condition in New Jersey today is as bad as it ever was in West Virginia during the coal strike. which is now over. If I may read from newspapers. as the Senator from Indiana did when arraigning West Virginia. I noticed yesterday in the metropolitan journals that Quinlan. though convicted. was able. nevertheless. to address large audiences. as any citizen who speaks upon great governmental questions should be permitted to do. but the advice that was gi ven. the threats that were made. indicated that. unless the judgment of that courtand I want to say that the judgments of New Jersey courts have always been held in great respect-\n'",explain first place quote constitution true quote refer writ_habea claim provision constitution certain exigency construe other provision constitution decision law high statute right selfpreservation inherent power government protect save first time mean proposition enunciate hope last hope such condition exist other render essential resort such extreme measure look situation face appreciate circumstance other suffer concede stand brink fearful precipice fall mean certain deathdeath individual death government iad well pause take stock look trouble other trouble tie light help help gain vote lose vote want preserve constitutional government face earth get handle unusual strike riot_insurrection show alone sound false chord beg leave read incorporate remark editorial publish issue head issue meet try present feeble wayan issue meet come collision use call justice convict ln_~ ite assault go penitentiary year sympathy labor seek assist labor lawful purpose extend tie interfere industrial quarrel coworker peacemaker negotiator citizen other member appear scene promote trouble intensify anger encourage violence face penalty lawlessness authority show bristle appear responsible labor organization manifest similar sentiment misguided man launch piratical_craft industrial sea avow enemy peace order law justice editorial labor organization way aim promote work inflict damage property injury employ labor contempt duty enforce law sentiment allude few moment say strike zone people sympathize misguided conduct labor secondary idea prevail industry government wage property right justice common ground employer employee meet peace impossible progress impossible 1he i. purpose destructive satisfied destruction destroy property seek intimidate capital terrorize labor entertain grotesque theory destroy government socalled labor organization sacrifice labor lawlessness make peace refuse arbitrate teach sedition crime know objective riot carry pulpy hand standard license place many illadvise illdisposed_person foolishly yleld appeal leader issue raise meet right interest labor right interest capital such hold high right society menace tie brawler organization represent legitimate interest avow wrecker habitation engage respectable industry challenge law nomad appear provoke disorder terror dignified title rebel revolutionist desperado deal desperado condition today bad coal strike read newspaper arraign notice yesterday metropolitan_journal convict able address large audience citizen speak great governmental question permit advice gi_ven threat make indicate judgment courtand want say judgment court hold great,63.0,bound,1,0

I have not raised the question of how much my State will be called upon to pay of this proposed appropriation. I do not do that because in years past. in resisting appropriations. it was a favorite effort of mine to call attention to the taxes paid by New York. Whenever I mentioned the fact that New York pays 30 percent of the Federal taxes. the fine Senator from North Carolina. Mr. Simmons. used to rise in his place and say. ""New York is the reservoir into which the wealth of the Nation flows. It is not made there. It is made elsewhere."" Nevertheless. my State will be called upon to pay a billion and a half of the money proposed to be appropriated in this joint resolution. I am not proud of the fact that large Federal projects have been given to my State. I am glad. of course. to see those great projects carried out. but with the wealth of the State of New York it is not necessary for us to pass the hat and ask for money to carry on our work. provided. as the Senator from Michigan and the Senator from Virginia have suggested. each State is left free to carry on its own relief work. I realize that there are States in the Union where it is not possible to provide the funds through State taxation. but I desire Senators to know that we. in the State of New York. have not failed to recognize our responsibility. The Senator from Michigan has put in figures showing that of the relief money expended in the State of New York. 49 percent came from the Federal Government. the other 51 percent through our State and its municipalities. My city of New York is spending $16.000.000 a month to take care of unemployed persons in the city. The State has bonded itself for large sums to carry on relief work in the city. Mr. President. this joint resolution carries a false implication. The joint resolution on its face appears to sayto use the figures called to my attention by the Senator from South Carolinathat we are going to spend $30.000.000 for professional and clerical persons. As a matter of fact. it does not actually do anything of the kind. There is a breakdown for these various projects. but at the end it says: Provided further. That not to exceed 20 percent of the amount herein appropriated may be used by the President to increase any one or more of the foregoing limitations if he finds it necessary to do so in order to effectuate the purpose of this joint resolution. Twenty percent of $5.000.000.000 is $1.000.000.000. A billion dollars may be taken from any part of this joint resolution and added to rural electrification. or some other project. I realize that it could be added to professional and clerical workers. but experience leads me to believe that that would not happen. Mr. President. I desire to have the citizens of my State know that. in my judgment. the joint resolution offers no relief to the suffering people in New York. As I said a moment ago. I would prefer to go back to the C. W. A. and make work. and give these people employment. rather than to have this joint resolution pass. Now I wish to make another statement. We could give this human relief by a very much smaller sum than we have written into the pending joint resolution. We are asked to provide $880.000.000 for direct relief. For my part. I am willing to add to that any amount necessary to give relief. If the joint resolution were written so that it provided $1.880.000.000. or $2.880.000.000. to make sure that those people who are now hungry and without shelter and clothing could be taken care of. I would gladly vote for it. but the proposal is to give $880.000.000 for direct relief. and then $4.000.000.000 is allocated. as suggested in the joint resolution. but with the proviso which sets aside at once such allocation. Mr. President. how long can this country continue to borrow billions of dollars? Is there no limit to the possibilities of what we may produce from our banks in the taking up of Government securities? We have gone on and on. until we find. in the portfolios of some banks. 50. 60. and even 75 percent of their securities in the form of Government bonds. No bank in the United States today dare lend money for the ordinary activities of the community in which the bank is located. because of the demand which is likely to come at any time for more money to take over Government securities. The banks are forced to take those Government securities because. if there should no longer be a market for them. there would be a slump in the price. I think I am right in quoting the Senator from Virginia. that if there should be a 10percent slump in Government securities. every bank and trust company and insurance company in the United States would be in insolvency. How long can we continue this sort of thing? We can continue it indefinitely. if it is a matter of taking care of human beings. but when we provide what is in effect a ""pork barrel "". to build projects here or there or elsewhere. even though some of them are in the State of New York. if we go on doing that sort of thing month after month and year after year. the time will come when there will be no funds to give for human relief. Mr. President. I realize that it is utterly useless to speak about these things. but let me remind you a bank which uses a million dollars of its deposits to buy Government securities has a million less to use for local enterprise. for the business and agriculture and the manufactures of the community. We are not going to buy our way into prosperity. we are going to buy our way into poverty.

The subcommittee deleted these provisions because they felt that it was openended and not certain enough. But the result of this has been that there will be no flexibility in allowing courts to determine further exceptions to the hearsay rule that might be permissible because of practical guarantees of trustworthiness and arising from further advances in technology that we do not know about at the present time. When the subcommittees draft of the rule containing the omission of these proposed flexible rules was circulated. we had a great deal of comment. and most of it was adverse to the elimination of these provisions. Many of the constructive comments which the committee received were those of the committee of the American Bar Association and the District of Columbia Bar Committee recommending reinsertion of the provisions but in a modified form to cure the objections that had motivated the previous deletion by the subcommittee. and the specific recommendation of the American Bar Associations special committee is what I am offering here. 2390 co What it would do would be to say at the end of rule 803 and at the end of rule 804 that other exceptions not specifically covered by any of the foregoing exceptions to the hearsay rule would be allowed if they have equivalent circumstantial probability of trustworthiness. provided that the proponents intention to offer the statement was made known to the adverse party sufficiently in advance of the trial or hearing to provide him with a fair opportunity to prepare to meet it. This reinstates the openended hearsay provision which was deleted by the committee from the rules submitted by the Supreme Court. but it adopts the necessity of notice that is designed so that the opponent will not be taken by surprise when this exception to the hearsay rule is requested of the Court. I would urge that the committee vote in favor of this amendment which will allow some flexibility to the further progress of the exceptions to the hearsay rule occasioned by future technology that we do not now understand or know about. This amendment is guarded because the exception would have to have the equivalent circumstantial probability of trustworthiness. and it also would require the proponent to give notice before such an exception were sought.\n',rule send section appear end rule cover exception hearsay rule rule cover exception hearsay rule section provide flexibility future decision court regard make further exception hearsay rule technology improve change present state subcommittee delete provision feel openende certain result flexibility allow court determine further exception hearsay rule permissible practical guarantee trustworthiness arise further advance technology know present time subcommittee draft rule contain omission propose flexible rule circulate great deal comment most adverse elimination provision many constructive comment committee receive committee recommend reinsertion provision modify form cure objection motivate previous deletion subcommittee specific recommendation special committee offer co say end rule end rule other exception cover forego exception hearsay rule allow equivalent circumstantial probability trustworthiness provide proponent intention offer statement make known adverse party advance trial hear provide fair opportunity prepare meet reinstate openende hearsay provision delete committee rule submit adopt necessity notice design opponent take surprise exception hearsay rule request urge committee vote favor amendment allow flexibility further progress exception hearsay rule occasion future technology understand know amendment guard exception equivalent circumstantial probability trustworthiness require proponent give notice exception sought.\n,93.0,bound,1,0

I submit. for appropriate reference. in behalf. of myself and the Senator from Ohio . a resolution that. In order to assure that the conduct of the foreign policy of the United States is not adversely affected by clandestine domestic activities of the Central Intelligence Agency. there be created a select committee to be known as the Committee to Study the Foreign and DomesticRelated Activities of the Central Intelligence Agency. The committee shall consist of seven Senators appointed by the President of the Senate and shall report Its findings and recommendations to the Senate no later than January 1. 1968. The purpose of the proposed select committee is to make a full and complete .study and investigation of the foreign and domesticrelated activities of the Central Intelligence Agency with particular emphasis upon the effect of such activities upon domestic. private. and public American institutions and organizations and of the effect of such activities on American foreign policy. The resolution I am submitting would authorize the select committee to include in its investigations such matters as the subsidization of organizations within the United States which have an influence on -public opinion. the covert use or subsidization of academic institutions. student groups. foundations. trade unions. emigre groups. or other educational. economic. or special groups or individuals in the United States which might affect the foreign policy of the Nation. directly or indirectly... The select committee would also be authorized to investigate the subsidization of publications. radio broadcasts and other informational media disseminated in U.S. activities. The Central Intelligence Agency has been the subject of controversy during most of its 20year history since its establishment in 1947. It has frequently been accused of making foreign policy. and in so doing of usurping the roles of the President and of the Senate. Yet. perhaps at no other time in Its history have the activities of the CIA provided the occasion for as much comment and as much controversyin the press. among the public at large. as well as in the Congressas during the past few days. The very extensive information which has appeared in the press in recent days makes unnecessary a detailed review of the most recent charges against the CIA. It appears that the CIAs purpose in supplying these organizations with funds and attempting to place in leadership positions either its own men or those whom it could control was to improve the image of the United States abroad and thus to strengthen U.S. foreign policy. Regardless of the intent. serious questions of impropriety and imprudence are now raised. as are also questions about the lack of perception and sensitivity about the meaning of educational and similar institutions in a free society. It also appears that some became so dedicated to carrying out what they thought to be the national purpose that they lost sight of the basic principle accepted by a democratic society: that the end does not justify every means. In proposing a select committee I am not suggesting that the Nation does not need a Central Intelligence Agency. We all hope that a day will come when the Nation could feel secure without the need for clandestine intelligence and operations in foreign relations. That day is not here. It is my belief that the kind of study I am proposing would improve the effectiveness of the CIA. Neither is it my intention that a select committee would harass or question the integrity of the extensive lists of leaders of business. academic. social philanthropic. labor. and similar organizations who one way or. the other have been identified with CIA activities. The proposed investigation is to review the effect of CIA activities upon domestic institutions only for the purpose of preventing future adverse effects on the conduct of foreign policy. We may properly question the extent and methods of CIA activities with domestic institutions without questioning the dedication of leaders outside Government who responded to the invitation to serve the Government without credit or reward. In any case. we in Congress must assume some responsibility. The activitieg of the Central Intelligence Agency have been the concern of many Members of Congress over the years. The Hoover Commission in 1955 recommended a joint committee. The CIA has been the subject of over 150 proposaIs for Investigation or for stricter supervision introduced by Members of Congress in the past 20 years. Of all of the resolutions relating to the Central Intelligence Agency that have been submitted in the Senate. only two have ever come to the floor. The first was in 1956. when the Committee on Rules and Administration reported the proposal of the present majority leader for the creation of a Joint Committee on the Central Intelligence Agency. That proposal. which originally had wide sponsorship. was defeated by a vote of 27 to 59 on April 11. The only other proposal on the CIA which has ever come to the floor of the Senate was that reported last year by the Committee on Foreign Relations. where it reported a resolution which would have created a Senate Committee on Intelligence Operations made up of membership from the Appropriations. Armed Services. and Foreign Relations Committees. The Senate was not permitted to vote on the substance of this proposal. As Senators will recall. on July 14 of last year. this resolution was defeated on a procedural motion and referred to the Armed Services Committee whose chairman had stated that its subject matter was within his exclusive jurisdiction. The information now revealed about the widespread involvement of the CIA in domestic institutions has moved the issue for the Senate beyond the question of a jurisdictional dispute. Very serious questions have been raised about the effect of the past activities of the CIA on our domestic and foreign policies. These questions cannot be answered satisfactorily unless the Senate makes a thorough study of the situation. It is my view that the future effectiveness of the CIA requires that the Senate. with its special responsibilities in foreign policy. make such an investigation and report its recommendations. I believe that nothing less than a study of this kind will allay suspicions about the CIA in the future and restore public confidence. insofar as possible. about the propriety of its future operations. The study by a select committee which would be provided by the resolution I am submitting today would restore the public confidence in some national institutions. in their independence of undue Government influence. It would help protect the CIA from unsubstantiated charges that hinder the Agency In its primary task of collecting and disseminating to appropriate persons within the Government the intelligence on which an effective U.S. foreign policy can be based.\n',submit appropriate reference behalf resolution order assure conduct foreign policy affect clandestine domestic activity create select committee know study committee consist senator appoint report finding recommendation purpose propose select committee make full complete investigation foreign domesticrelated activity particular emphasis effect such activity domestic private public american institution organization effect such activity american foreign policy resolution submit authorize select committee include investigation such matter subsidization organization influence -public opinion covert use subsidization academic institution student group foundation trade union emigre group other educational economic special group individual affect foreign policy select committee authorize investigate subsidization publication radio_broadcast other informational_medium disseminate activity subject controversy most history establishment accuse make foreign policy do usurp role other time history activity provide occasion much comment much controversyin_press public large past few day extensive information appear press recent day make unnecessary detailed review recent charge appear purpose supply organization fund attempt place leadership position own man control improve image strengthen foreign policy intent serious question impropriety_imprudence raise question lack perception sensitivity meaning educational similar institution free society appear become dedicated carry think national purpose lose_sight basic principle accept democratic society end justify mean propose select committee suggest need hope day come nation feel secure need clandestine_intelligence operation foreign relation day belief kind study propose improve effectiveness intention select committee harass question integrity extensive list leader business academic social philanthropic labor similar organization way other identify activity propose investigation review effect activity domestic institution purpose prevent future adverse_effect conduct foreign policy question extent method activity domestic institution question dedication leader respond invitation serve credit reward case assume responsibility activitieg concern many member year recommend joint committee subject strict supervision introduce member past year resolution relate submit come floor first report proposal present majority_leader creation proposal wide sponsorship defeat vote only other proposal come floor report last year report resolution create make membership permit vote substance proposal senator recall last year resolution defeat procedural motion refer chairman state subject matter exclusive_jurisdiction information reveal widespread involvement domestic institution move issue question jurisdictional_dispute serious question raise effect past activity domestic foreign policy question answer make thorough study situation view future effectiveness require special responsibility foreign policy make investigation report recommendation believe less study kind allay_suspicion future restore public confidence possible propriety future operation study select committee provide resolution submit today restore public confidence national institution independence undue government influence help protect unsubstantiated charge hinder primary task collect_disseminate appropriate person intelligence effective foreign policy based.\n,90.0,bound,0,1

Here is something that possibly a good many have overlooked. I had until I made this examination. In section (c) of this act it is provided that in ascertaining the difference between the cost of production under the previous subdivisions. (a) and (b) of this section. the President. insofar as he finds it practicable. shall take into consideration the difference in conditions in production. including wage. cost of material. and other items. in the cost of production of such articles in the United States and in competing territory. Then follows 2 and 3 and 4. and 4 is a very interesting provision. It is as follows: Any other advantage or disadvantage in competition. Therefore. we have a law on the statute books now which authorizes the President of the United States in modifying the rate fixed by the Congress up or down 50 percent to take into consideration what we know as the costofproduction difference. and then any other advantage or disadvantage in competition. That is as broad as the earth. It is difficult to conceive of any motive or reason or justification that a President would like to have actuate him in changing tariff rates which he wants to change that could not be covered in under that language. I want now to refer you to the language of Chief Justice Taft. already referred to. in which he declared that the same principal which permits Congress to delegate power to fix railroad rates authorizes Congress to delegate power to fix custom rates. This is what the Court held: The same principle that permits Congress to exercise its ratemaking power in interstate commerce by declaring the rule which shall prevail in the legislative fixing of rates and enables it to remit to a ratemaking body created in accordance with this provision the fixing of such rates justifies a similar provision for the fixing of customs duties on imported merchandise. After one reads that declaration by the Supreme Court and calls to mind the wide range of discretion exercised by the Interstate Commerce Commission of the United States in fixing rates. any lingering doubt as to the constitutionality of this bill disappears. I have not tried to make a constitutional argument of the orthodox sort. I hope I may have been of some assistance even to those who do not agree with my conclusions.

Aye. more. it appropriates every dollar that shall be collected under existing law upon imports from Puerto Rico. That is the House bill. Now. then. when that bill was reported the gentleman from Tennessee and the gentlemen from Texas and 108 men upon that side of the House voted nay on its passage. That was action. talk is cheap. Action speaks for itself. The bill passed. It went to the Senate. the Senate accepted the bill so far as the $2.000.000 is concerned. but the Senate struck out that part of the bill which appropriates the money collected on those imports from Puerto Rico since the 1st of January. It strikes out that portion of the bill that devotes the money that shall be collected tomorrow. next day. next week. next month. as long as those duties are collected upon the imports from Puerto Rico. Now. my motion is to nonconcur in that action of the Senate. If the bill is right for $2.000.000 for the benefit of Puerto Rico. it is right for the balance. and the 108 men that voted against anything. $2.000.000 and everything else. voiced by the gentleman from Arkansas and the gentleman from Texas . come in and indulge in language. languagel The gentleman from Texas has indulged in language. and what language it was!

So at least he will say let us reform the legislation. even though he does not like the idea of cutting taxes. While I support this bill. I have concern that the bill does little to mitigate the impact of the bureaucratic unions on the restructuring efforts. In 1996. Congress made serious attempts to downsize and reform the IRS. These efforts. however. were hampered by the union that represents the IRS employees. As pointed out in a Washington Post article. the union was more concerned with keeping their dues than helping Congress and their union Members make the IRS operate better. I am also disturbed about the abuse of official time that has taken place at the IRS. Official time is. ""authorized paid time off for Federal employees to engage in union activities."" In laymans terms. that is union work at taxpayers expense. Although there may be some legitimate functions for using official time. the amount is skyrocketing at the IRS. Last year alone. the employees logged in over 718.000 hours. 718.000 hours paid by the taxpayers for official time to do union work. This is a 55percent increase since 1993.

1100206551,S,20080929,20,Mr. ALEXANDER,Unknown,ALEXANDER,Unknown,M,470,644,09292008.txt,6158,460,110118281,ALEXANDER,LAMAR,S,TN,M,R,,voting,Mr. President. over the weekend bipartisan congressional negotiators worked hard to amend significantly what we have come to call the Paulson plan. The whole point of the work over the weekendsince last Thursday. in factwas to do everything we could to protect taxpayers. We owe our thanks to Senators GREGG and DODD and Senators MCCONNELL and REID. as well as Members of the House of Representatives and the administration and their staffs for working hard. sometimes during most of the night. to have this ready for us today. Actually. it was ready yesterday and was posted on the Internet so that not only we. but people across this country and around the world. could see what was proposed. Under the amended plan. the Secretary of Treasury will have authority to buy and sell troubled mortgage assets to get the economy moving again. Taxpayers will have authority to provide oversight. minimize losses. and make sure profits go to reduce the Federal debt. There will be restrictions on excessive executive compensation and reasonable efforts will be made to make adjustments to help keep people in their homes. People have been calling my office all week about it. as they have all Senators. They are angry about the need to do this. I am angry. too. But callers opinions have been changing about whether we should do it. as I believe have the minds of most Senators. Most realize that the largest reason for this emergency legislation is mortgage loans that people cannbt pay back and securities based upon those mortgages. This has derailed housing and created problems for banks. It has spread uncertainty and caused people with cash to be cautious. Most realize now that we are not spending $700 billion. The Secretary may buy up to $700 billion in troubled mortgage assetsenough to restore confidencebut he may buy much less. Over time. he will sell those assets. hopefully at a profit. sometimes at a loss. My guessand it is only a guessnet cost to the taxpayer will be $100 billion or less. twothirds of what Congress spent in January on the economic stimulus package of tax cuts and rebates. There might even be a profit. which under the plan. would go to reduce the Federal debt. Most now realize it is important for the Secretary of.Treasury to be able to buy enough mortgage assets so that institutions are strong again. will start lending again. and people will stop hoarding their cash. Next week we can fix the blame. Today we need to fix the problem. Congress should approve the amended plan without delaytoday. If the House can pass it today. there is no reason.why the Senate cannot pass it today and send it to the President. Otherwise. there is a real risk that credit will freeze and Americans will not be able to get car. student. auto. mortgage or farm credit loans--or even to cash their paychecks. This has come so fast and taken such an unexpected turn that it is hard for most Americans to know what to think about it. As Senator DOMENICI and Senator GREGG have suggested. think about it as a wreck on the highway. Think about it as someone who should have known better. dumping thousands of bad mortgage loans and other assets in the middle of an eightlane interstate. threatening to bring a halt to all economic traffic. Stopped in one lane is your home loan. In the next is your auto loan. In the third lane is your student loan. In the next is your mortgage loan. Next. your money market account. Next. the money for your farm credit loan -or even your payroll check. Vehicles carrying these essential -credits that Americans rely on every day have ground to a halt on the economic highway. blocked by a big pile of bad mortgage loans. So we end up with this massive wreck in the middle of the economic highway. Think of the Federal Government as the salvage crew and Secretary Paulson as the driver of the wrecker. His job is to buy the salvage and get it off the highway as soon as possible so that traffic can start moving again. And think of yourself. the taxpayer. as the owner of the salvage companydoing everything possible to make sure the driver of the wrecker can get the pile of bad loans off the highway and sell them for at least as much as it cost him to pick them up. If he does this. then the lanes will open again. and the vehicles carrying your auto and mortgage and farm credit loans and payroll checks will start moving again. And the economic traffic will start up again. But that will not be the end of fixing the problem. The Federal Governments compassion several years ago got out ahead of its common sense when it made it possible for people to borrow money and buy homes who couldnt pay back their mortgage loans. Clever financiers created exotic instruments based upon these loans. some of which turned out to be worth less than the loans. People who should have known what was going onboth in their own companies and in regulatory agenciesdidnt understand what was going on or they turned a blind eye to it. or worse. they misled people. As the New York Times described it yesterday in an article. what apparently has happened is that mortgage foreclosures set off questions about the quality of debts across the entire credit spectrum. These questions set off a spiral of claims against insufficient insurance. as in the case of AIG. and of insufficient capital in the case of banks. So we end up with this massive wreck in the middle of the economic highway. This weektodaywe need to fix the immediate problem. Clean the wreck off the highway. But next week we need to begin to take steps to remodel our regulatory agenciesmost of which were designed to deal with the calamities of the 1930s. I suspect it will be a matter of a different kind of regulation that suits these times rather than one of more regulation. And we need to find out if there was fraud or misleading actions so we can do our best to make sure this doesnt happen again. Next week we can fix the blame. Today we should unclog the economic highway and fix the immediate problem to make sure Americans can buy homes and cars and houses. go to college. get farm credit loans and cash their payroll checks.

I would like to take a few moments to memorialize the late William Casey. a good friend of 20 years and leader. whose life spanned some of the most turbulent periods in history. Bill was never a spectator in his 74 years. From his younger days when he was given the nickname ""Cyclone."" through his service to our Nation during World War II and his most recent work May 11. 1987 . COt as Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. Bill spent every moment at the center *of the arena of our national life:. - Bill Casey earned the trust and admiration of everyone with whom he dealt. whether in business or government. He was far more than a tough corporate attorney. financier. and selfmade millionaire. Bill was a man who sought challenges at every point in his life and overcame obstacles to achieve success that most of us cannot imagine. Whether he was planning missions behind- the lines in Nazi Germany or raising funds for a local hospital four decades later. Bill worked tirelessly to meet the demands of his day. I know that a biographer will some day reveal the true scope of activity and energy that Bill displayed each and every day. I am honored to have known a man with the fortitude and spirit of William Casey. His legacy of service to others will stand next to many of historys great leaders who never tired or gave up in the crucible of public life. His belief in human freedom and his efforts to ensure the -rights of residents of every corner of the globe will remain a symbol of the finest tradition of American political courage. I know Bill will be missed in Nassau County where he taught me .many valuable lessons in. politics. Perhaps most important. I know he will be missed as a loving father and husband. and I extend my deepest condolences to his wife. Sophie. and his daughter and soninlaw. I hope every Member of this body will spend a moment of prayer and reflection on the.meaning of service to others and the example which Bill Casey set for all of us.\n'",like take few moment memorialize late good friend year leader life span_turbulent period history spectator year young day give nickname service nation recent work cot spend moment center arena national life earn trust admiration deal business government more tough corporate attorney financier selfmade_millionaire man seek challenge point life overcome_obstacle achieve success most imagine plan mission line raise fund local hospital decade work meet demand day know biographer day reveal true scope activity energy display day honor know man fortitude spirit legacy service other stand many historys great leader tire give crucible public life belief human freedom effort ensure -right resident corner_globe remain symbol fine tradition american political courage know miss teach valuable lesson politic important know miss love father husband extend deep_condolence wife_daughter soninlaw hope body spend moment prayer reflection the.meaning service other example set us.\n,100.0,daily,1,0

I commend the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma for offering this amendment. I want him to know that I support it completely. and I am grateful for his efforts. The change in law that this amendment would provide is an absolutely reasonable one. It is one that is of utmost importance. as he has said. to American agriculture. As background. I indicate that I am a cosponsor of S. 2875. introduced by Senator BOREN. and I believe 38 of our colleagues also are cosponsors. including almost all the Committee on Agriculture. Nutrition. and Forestry. Mr. President. the Senator from North Carolina has long been concerned about the interpretation by the Department of Labor of the Farm Labor Contractor Registration Act. known as FLCRA. I believe that the clarification provided by the amendment. drawn from S. 2875. is absolutely essential at this time. Last year. I assisted in constructing amendments to FLCRA which would address the major concerns of farmers. who are now burdened and harassed under this law. as described by the Senator from Oklahoma. and my interest has continued in this matter. through support of the legislation proposed by the Senator from Oklahoma and the amendment he now offers. As ranking member of the Committee on Agriculture. Nutrition. and Forestry. I am distressed that the issue is just as much an agricultural concern as it is a matter involving labor. I believe the Committee on Agriculture. Nutrition and. Forestry is concerned about the proper administration and enforcement of FLCRA but not exceeding the scope of what Congress intended to accomplish by the original act. The pending amendment offered by the Senator from Oklahoma would alleviate a source of redtape and paperwork for farmers and other agricultural employers. and in doing so. it would free these producers to get on with the business of feeding and clothing the American people and people in many other lands. One thing should be clear. Mr. President. and that is that th.s amendment will not gut the Farm Labor Contractor Registration Act. This amendment will not exempt giant corporate farms from coverage under the act. This amendment would not eliminate the substantive protections against abuse that are available to migrant workers. What the amendment will do is to insure that the present law is administered and enforced properly to protect farm workers from serious abuses by labor crew leaders and farm labor contractors. Congress never intended that the law consider farm labor contractors to include farmers and their employees who are tied to the land or property and are permanently located. As a further indication of congressional intent. the section on congressional findings and FLCRA indicates that the act is to protect both the producers of agricultural products and migrant agricultural laborers. It is clear that we would not consider agricultural producers to be ""farm labor contractors"" when we are trying to protect them against exploitation from farm labor contractors. So. Mr. President. bona fide farmers in my own State this summer are feeling the effects of the misinterpretation of this act. Instead of targeting their efforts to enforcement of FLCRA against unscrupulous crew leaders and administering this law as Congress intended. the Department of Labor has. according to my understanding. inconvenienced and harassed numerous farmers who are attempting to produce their crops. These farmers are not crew leaders. These farmers are not farm labor contractors. They are farmers. period. I suppose I find this activity even more aggravating because the Department of Labor has to be aware that we are trying to correct the regulatory abuse to which they have been and are subjecting farmers and ranchers. Our action in approving this amendment will only strengthen the Farm Labor Contractor Registration Act and it will help promote the understanding of farmers and proper regulation of crew leaders. The result should be a more efficient and less costly enforcement of existing law. It is important that we give our approval to the amendment offered by the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma and redirect FLCRA toward its stated intent so that Congress does not have to continue to provide special clarifications as has been the case in the past. It is timeconsuming to do this and will not really solve the problems just as our attempts to persuade the Department of Labor to correct their interpretation have been a waste of time and have not been successful. So again I commend the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma. and I want him to know that I strongly support his amendment.\n'",commend distinguished offer amendment want know support grateful effort change law amendment provide reasonable utmost_importance say american agriculture background indicate cosponsor introduce believe colleague cosponsor include concern interpretation know believe clarification provide amendment draw essential time last year assist construct amendment address major concern farmer burden harass law describe interest continue matter support legislation propose amendment offer ranking member distressed issue much agricultural concern matter involve labor believe nutrition concerned proper administration enforcement exceed scope intend accomplish original act pende amendment offer alleviate source redtape_paperwork farmer other agricultural employer do free producer get business feeding_clothing american people people many other land thing clear th.s amendment gut amendment exempt giant corporate farm coverage act amendment eliminate substantive protection abuse available migrant_worker amendment insure present law administer enforce protect farm worker serious abuse labor crew leader farm labor contractor intend law consider farm labor contractor include farmer employee tie land property locate further indication congressional intent section congressional finding indicate act protect producer agricultural product migrant agricultural laborer clear consider agricultural producer farm labor contractor try protect exploitation farm labor contractor farmer own summer feel effect misinterpretation act target effort enforcement unscrupulous crew leader administer law intend accord understanding inconvenience harass numerous farmer attempt produce crop farmer crew leader farmer farm labor contractor farmer period suppose find activity aggravating aware try correct regulatory abuse subject farmer_rancher action approve amendment strengthen help promote understanding farmer proper regulation crew leader result efficient costly enforcement exist law important give approval amendment offer distinguished redirect state intent continue provide special clarification case past timeconsuming solve problem attempt persuade correct interpretation waste time successful commend distinguished want know support amendment.\n,96.0,bound,1,0

May I call attention to the hearings held in reference to this bill. beginning at page 889? There appeared before the committee a distinguished Representative on the majority side of the House. the gentleman from Arkansas . He told the committee that last year we produced in America 28.428 tons of manganese as against 315.000 tons in 1918. The requirements of the United States for this strategic war material are 700.000 tons a year. Just so the industry might have a little harder sledding and so that our Government might be in a little worse shape if we were in trouble and needed manganese. and could not import it any longer. a reciprocaltrade agreement was made with Brazil a little over a year ago in which the tariff was reduced from 1 cent to onehalf cent a pound. This results in a difference of only a few cents a ton in the cost of steel. but it makes an insuperable difference in the cost of manganese and the ability of the American producer to produce it.

The committee assumes that a mandatory means the carrying out of a prograiln according to that report. but I wish to say that a mandatory does not necessarily mean anything of the kind. The covenant of the League of Nations. under which this request is made. specifically provides that the mandate may be limited to the furnishing of administrative advice and assistance. Have the Committee on Foreign Relations considered that phase of the case? Not at all. They have assumed that we are to go over and there take full responsibility for the running of that Government. that we should send soldiers over there at our. own expense. that we should incur this great financial liability and endanger the lives of American soldiers. But there is absolutely nothing in the terms under which this request was made that would warrant any such assumption. So I say that it seems to nie the Committee on Foreign Relations ought to take up the question. consider the various phases of the mandate. and determine whether this great.countiy of ours should not in its liberality do something to aid those oppressed people. We have passed resolutions expressing our sympathy for them. Do we mean what we say? I do not know whether we ought to have a mandate or not. but I am not willing to vote for the resolution and forclose the day of investigation.\n',think ipparent say chairman committee committee consider situation other contain report reference make committee assume mandatory mean carrying prograiln accord report wish say mandatory mean kind covenant request make provide mandate limit furnishing administrative advice assistance consider phase case assume go take full responsibility running government send soldier own expense_incur great financial liability endanger life american soldier term request make warrant such assumption say seem take question consider various phase mandate determine great.countiy our liberality aid oppress people pass resolution express sympathy mean say know mandate willing vote resolution forclose day,66.0,bound,0,1

I rise to state my reasons for voting to bring debate on this. amendment to a close. and to. pass the constitutional amendment to balance the budget. Mr. President. Washington is a city resounding with alarms. Every time we turn around another alarm is going off. another crisis is upon us. The. health crisis. The education crisis.. The childrens crisis. The urban crisis. The environmental crisis. The Russian crisis. The farm crisis. The information age brings all these problems instantaneously to our attention. No wonder Time magazines Man of the Year this January was Ted Turner. a. news person rather than a policymaker. I am afraid- we have all become like the family that. moved In next to the firehouse. At first. the sirens shocked and terrified them. But over the days and. months and years. they got used to it. to the point. they barely noticed anymore. As we stand here on the floor the proponents of this amendment are trying desperately to sound an alarm: there is a. fire.. and It is the firehouse itself which is burning dow. Government. our collective capacity to. deal with all ther other crises we face. is In crisis Itself. because It is $4 trillion short of no money at all. There is no denying it.. Mr. President. Right now. today. we are destroying the financial capacity of this Government to respond to genuine needs. We are. at the same time. committing grand larceny on the resources and hopes of our children and. grandchildren. We are more than $1 billion further in debt right now than we were yesterday at this time. -S9257 For every 31 of natIonal debt we had when I arrived fn Wasington 13 years ago we now have $5 That Is over $16 O for every man. woman and child in America. That. is the catastrophic centet in which we face this choice. Will we perceive the. danger we are in and act accordingly? Or will we sit by posturing and debating like nothing is really wrong? Mr. President. I am in agreement with many of the arguments raised by my colleagues against this. amendment. The Constitution is the most remarkable political document on earth. We should. not lightly put ourselves in the place of the founding fathers to edit and alter the Constitution which has served us so well. Tampering with the balance In the Constitution between the branches of Government should be avoided. We can each create a range of. disturbing scenarios which could occur under a balanced budget amendment As we have seen. in the experience of GrammRudmanHollings. budget mechanisms do not. of themselves. produce balanced budgets Mechanisms are only as good as the Intelligence and courage with which they are. used. It is not the Constitutions fault that we have an unbalanced budget. That Is our fault: this generation of Americans. We who. lead. and those who have elected us to do. so. have chosen to live beyond our means. to believe we can have without paying. We have all made our speeches on this floor at various times. ""We will not balance the budget on the backs of the poor.* * * We will not. balance the budget. on the backs of the elderly ** or children or farmers * * * or veterans."" Or ""We win not balance this budget at the expense of taxpayers We will not balance this budgeb at. the expense of national security* * * or our allies overseas or American workers * * *"" Well when you take whats common from all those speeches you get a simple statement We will not balance the budget. Period. 1 cannot live with that. Mr. President. Neither can yet unborn Americans whose future is at. stake in .this debate. No one will stand on this floor and say they are for increasing the national debt. No one will attempt to defend the current situation as. one that is healthy for America. But a generation from now. what we have said will not matter. they will only care about what we did. Regardless of how elegantly we defend It and how skillfully we debunk each new way of doing things. what we are actually doing is passing on to our future citizens a lesser America than the one we inherited. It all boils down to this for me. Mr. President. In. Government. just like in life. If nothing changes. nothing changes. And we absolutely can not afford for things not to change. $70 billion deficits under Jimmy Carter did not change anything. Ronald Reagans tax cuts and spending cuts did not change anything. The budget resolution of 1985. crafted by the Republican leader to balance the budget in 5 years did not change anything. GrammRudmanHollings did not change anything. Kicking a bunch of Democrats. and then a bunch of Republicans out of the Senate did not change anything. And $408 billion in debt is not changing anything. that I can see from the Presidential campaigns. The only hope we have left is to change the fundamental rules of the game. to change our Constitution. It is a drastic measure. to be sure. But is it any more drastic than the economic calamity we face if we keep on doing what were doing? I am not 100 percent convinced this amendment will work. but I have far less confidence in any other answer I have heard here or anyplace on the campaign trail. And I have been listening. Mr. President. To the leaders of my generation. and the leaders of my childrens generation. I gave my first speech on the dangers of debt in 1984 to a graduation of St. Olaf College.

I want every Member of this great body to remember Tea Pot Dome and to remember DixonYates. for these are minor scandials compared with the giveaway at Hells Canyon. On April 25. 1957. this tarnished Republican Administration issued an order that will. in effect. require American taxpayers to foot the bill for a large part of the cost of two private dams on the Snake River by the Idaho Power Co. It is not enough that Sherman Adams. the power behind the throne and the protector of private power monopoly. has maneuvered to the Idaho Power Co. the Hells Canyon stretch of the Snake River. It is not enough that a former Secretary of the Interior tore up a memorandum he had written supporting the mighty Hells Canyon Dam when it became apparent that such support violated the private power commitments of this resourcesoiled administration. It is not enough that the Federal Power Commission has been handpicked to grant the will of the private power monoply. It is not enough that the present Secretary of the Interior has been overruled in his feeble attempts to provide a partial restoration of the great public loss at Hells Canyon. No. Mr. Speaker. not even the above maneuvers have been sufficient. for now it has been disclosed that this already soiled administration has bailed out the Idaho Power Co. at the expense of every single American taxpayer by providing quick tax write off certificates which will insure complete subsidization for this project. Mr. Speaker. we from the Pacific Northwest are well acquainted with a Republican Party which has dealt from the bottom of the deck on the matter of natural resources. Apparently the National Republican administration has failed to heed the revolt against those policies as expressed in the 1956 election returns in the Pacific Northwest. My colleagues in this House. as well as the Members of the other body. have frequently heard about the need for a high dam at Hells Canyon during the past few years. I am sure that the details concerning the need for this high dam. with its great power potential and Its millions of acrefeet of storage have seemed complicated. All that has been said about the needs of the Pacific Northwest for this power and this storage and all that has been said concerning the inadequacies of a series of small dams with limited power and token storage is true. There is no need to belabor these facts. The information is available and speaks for Itself. However. the issue before Congress today involves more than storage capacity and power potential. This is a simple question of morality. Mr. Speaker. these rapid tax writeoff certificates are being justified as ""necessary in the interest of national defense during the emergency period."" As the amortization provision of the 1954 tax law. section 116. states. this is the criteria that must be met in order for the Office of Defense Mobilization to issue such certificates. In granting these certificates. I submit that both the will of Congress and the spirit of the law have been violated. Presumably. the certificates were issued In the name of national defense. but I submit that if these low dams have any bearing whatsoever on national defense. that contribution is detrimental to the longrange interests of the Nation. The granting of these certificates is nothing more than another aspect of the flagrant giveaway on the part of this administration. The Idaho Power Co. has estimated that the cost of the Brownlee project will be $67.100.000 and the cost of the Oxbow Dam is estimated at $35 million. The certificates issued by the Office of Defense Mobilization has approved a tax writeoff amounting to 65 percent of the cost of building Brownlee and 60 percent of the cost of constructing Oxbow. Thus. the total amount for the 2 dams of $65.200.000 has been approved for rapid tax amortization. Normally. a company would pay Federal taxes on 52 percent of the $65.200.000 or a total tax of $30.500.000. Thus. the Idaho Power Co.. by the decision of the Office of Defense Mobilization. is given an interestfree. taxpaid loan of $6.100.000 per year for 5 years. According to the best available information. if the two dams were completed according to schedule. this would mean that the Idaho Power Co. would be given complete forgiveness for all income taxes for the next several years. Conversely. the Federal Government will lose in revenue in the area of $6.100.000 annuallyan annual loss which the Federal Government must borrow and pay interest on if funds are to be available for Government operations. Continual refinancing which is thus necessitated will mean that the American taxpayer will pay $22.900.000 in interest on the interestfree loan to Idaho Power Co. I doubt if anyone will quarrel with my use of a 3percent figure as the average cost of money to the Government during this Republican tightmoney era. As a recipient of a taxfree loan. Idaho Power Co. will be in a position to invest over $30 million at a rate of approximately 6 percent. which earnings can in turn be compounded. Over the 50year period of its Federal license. the company will be in a position to realize a net windfall of approximately $329 millionall made possible by the biggest Government giveaway yet reported. Mr. Speaker. I think it is high time that the American people took stock of what they can expect to receive as a result of this deal. The American people lose $30.500.000 in taxes over a period of 5 years. They must pay $22.900.000 in interest charges over a period of 50 years. Idaho Power receives a net windfall of $329 million. And for this dubious exchange. what does the Pacific Northwest receive? We lose 500.000 kilowatts of yearround cheap power by destroying the possibility of a high Hells Canyon Dam. We lose 2.880.000 acrefeet of vitally needed storage for flood control and downstream power generation. We lose the possibility of irrigating 1 million acres of upstream land throughpotential power revenues from a high dam at Hells Canyon. We lose recreation and fish and wildlife facilities for millions of Americans. We lose. at a time when the region is undergoing an economic slump. thousands of jobs and new industries that would produce more goods and pay more taxes to the Federal Government. The Snake River Basin loses all hope of 3mill powerbut instead will hereafter be subservient to monopoly control at three times that rate. The region and the Nation will pay the cost of a high Hells Canyon Dam without any of the benefitsa dam which would be an investment and a defense asset for the American people rather than a bonanza for the Idaho Power Co. If Congress authorizes the high dam. the ratepayers will fully reimburse the cost of the project plus all interest costs incurred by the Government. and at the end of a 50year period the people of the United States will own. free and clear. a project which will bring $25 million to $30 million annually into the Federal Treasury. Idaho Power Co.. through its representatives. loudly proclaimed that it was asking that it be permitted the privilege of constructing. solely with its own money and without one cent of cost to the taxpayers of the United States. the low dams on the Snake. Yet today. the Idaho Power Co. stands as the recipient of a $329 million bonanza and you and I and the American public are footing the bill. I would also like to draw attention to a fullpage advertisement on the Idaho Power Co. plans in the May 26. 1956. edition of the Saturday Evening Post which was paid for by the American electric ratepayers. This advertisement said. in part. ""Americas more than 400 independent electric light and power companies do not have to wait for an act of Congress for tax money from the Treasury."" and added that the Idaho Power Co.s construction of its three low dams on the Snake River ""will save you and your fellow taxpayer $465 million."" The issuance of these tax writeoff certificates proves the fraudulence of that statement. Taxpayers dollars will be used to build the private dams. The administration through subterfuge is giving away a resource that now can be saved only through congressional action. Mr. Speaker. the brazenness of this latest perversion of public policy cries out for an immediate investigation. The economic and political strangulation of my district and of the Pacific Northwest can no longer be permitted. We cannot afford to stand by while the agents of this administration through conspiracy with the private utility monopoly desecrate our remaining natural resources. Congress has a right to know the reasons why this administration is subsidizing Idaho Power Co.\n'",want great body remember remember minor scandial compare giveaway tarnished issue order effect require american taxpayer foot bill large part cost private dam enough power throne protector private power monopoly maneuver stretch enough former tear memorandum write support mighty become apparent such support violate private power commitment resourcesoiled administration enough handpicke grant will private power monoply enough present overrule feeble attempt provide partial restoration great public loss above maneuver sufficient disclose soil administration bail expense single american taxpayer provide quick tax write certificate insure complete subsidization project acquaint deal bottom deck matter natural_resource administration fail heed revolt policy express election return colleague other body hear need high dam past few year sure detail concern need high dam great power potential million acrefeet_storage seem complicated say need power storage say concern inadequacy series small dam limited power token storage true need belabor fact information available speak issue today involve more storage capacity power potential simple question morality rapid tax writeoff certificate justify necessary interest national defense emergency period amortization provision tax law section state criterion meet order issue such certificate grant certificate submit will spirit law violate certificate issue name national defense submit low dam bearing national defense contribution detrimental longrange interest nation granting certificate more aspect flagrant giveaway part administration estimate cost project cost estimate certificate issue approve tax writeoff amount percent cost build percent cost construct total amount dam approve rapid tax amortization company pay federal taxis percent total tax decision give interestfree_loan year year accord good available information dam complete accord schedule mean give complete forgiveness income taxis next several year lose revenue area annuallyan annual loss borrow pay interest fund available operation continual refinancing necessitate mean american taxpayer pay interest interestfree_loan doubt quarrel use figure average cost money republican tightmoney era recipient taxfree loan position invest rate percent earning turn compound 50year_period federal license company position realize net windfall make possible big giveaway report think high time american people take stock expect receive result deal american people lose taxis period year pay interest charge period year receive net windfall dubious exchange receive lose kilowatt yearround cheap power destroy possibility high lose acrefeet need storage flood control downstream power generation lose possibility irrigate_acre upstream land throughpotential power revenue high dam lose recreation fish_wildlife facility million lose time region undergo economic slump thousand job new industry produce more good pay more taxis lose hope powerbut subservient monopoly control time rate region pay cost high dam investment defense asset american people bonanza authorize high dam ratepayer reimburse cost project interest cost incur end 50year_period people own free clear project bring representative proclaim ask permit privilege construct own money cent cost taxpayer low dam today stand recipient bonanza american public foot bill like draw attention fullpage_advertisement plan edition pay american electric_ratepayer advertisement say part more independent electric light power company wait act tax money add construction low dam save fellow taxpayer issuance tax writeoff certificate prove fraudulence statement taxpayer dollar use build private dam administration subterfuge give resource save congressional action brazenness late perversion public policy cry immediate investigation economic political strangulation district permit afford stand agent administration conspiracy private utility monopoly desecrate remain natural_resource right know reason administration subsidize co.\n,85.0,bound,0,1

President Carter has continued his exhortations to class warfare by attacking capital gains tax relief as ""huge tax windfalls for millionaires and two bits for the average American."" Like his earlier attacks on the oil industry. doctors. and lawyers. this one is woefully short on facts. commonsense. and good manners. Taking Carters own analysis as accurate. the figures show that the ""average American"" would profit handsomely from the kind of tax relief called for in the SteigerHansen bill. which I have joined in sponsoring in the Senate. The Wall Street Journal produced some sample figures totally destroying the Presidents argument that average Americans would not gain from this reform. but I would like to cite a source closer to home. lest the Journal be thought full of special pleaders. The Washington Post carries a regular column by Bill Gold. called the District Line. It is generally about matters concerned with life here in the Nations Capital. and it rarely dips into partisan politics. Over the years. Bill Gold has achieved a reputation for fairness and commonsense that would be hard to match. and which is greatly to be envied. In a recent column. Mr. Gold comments on President Carters attack on capital gains tax reform. Before asking unanimous consent that the column be printed in its entirety. I would like to quote just the last paragraph from it. appropriating it as my own advice to the President on this and other questions. Profit is not unAmerican. Mr. President. Gain is not a dirty word. When you take aim at those awful millionaires. please make sure you dont hit the little guys who elected you. I submit for the RECORD the Bill Gold column and also a Wall Street Journal editorial on the same subject. and providing other specific examples: [From the Washington Post. July 3. 1978] DID You HAVE A CAPITAL GAIN? OH. How AWFUL! (By Bill Gold) President Carters threat to veto a change in our capital gains tax rules was couched in trite political verbiage. The president said. ""The American people want some tax relief from the heavy burden of taxation on their shoulders. but neither they nor I will tolerate a plan that provides huge windfalls for millionaires and two bits for the average American."" The average American has not read the present capital gains law. He knows little about the changes Congress is discussing and thinks he will never be affected by the capital gains tax. So demagogic politicians find it easy to win votes by implying. ""Us po folks have got to gang up on them rich millionaires."" The truth is that millionaires can live without capital gains reform better than the average American. Millionaires hire tax counselors who know dozens of sophisticated ways to shelter income from taxation. They use real estate depreciation. depletion allowances. taxfree investments. personal corporations. private foundations and many other techniques. The average American. on the other hand. is a lamb born to endure endless shearing. He can afford neither canny tax counsel nor the exotic tax shelters used by the Big Rich. The average American works for a paycheck. His employers computer talks to the IRS computer. The governments searchlight is zeroed in on his income. and there is no place he can hide. The average American tries to save a mite out of each deductionriddled paycheck. When he manages to put something aside for his old age. he is likely to lend the money or invest it. He usually lends it to the government by buying its securities. or to bankers by opening a savings account. or to business firms by buying their bonds. But in time of inflation. lending money is of dubious wisdom. If the lender earns 8 percent interest and inflation erodes 8 percent of his principal. the lender doesnt break even. he loses. His interest income is taxed. If the saver invests. he is likely to buy a hous? first. then shares of stock. perhaps in the business that employs him. Our tax laws are deliberately structured to encourage employee stock ownership plans. It takes a long time for a house or a growth stock to produce a substantial gain. but if the investor has put his money into a good house or a good company. his investment may eventually increase in value. If it does. in his old age he ought to be able to sell his stock and his house. move into an apartment or nursing home. and live out his remaining days in peace. But much depends on how his onceinalifetime gains will be taxed. The $15.000 house he sells for $75.000 produces a welcome profit. but a profit that would melt quickly if it were taxed as ordinary income. Considerably more than Mr. Carters ""two bits"" is at stake here. Longterm gains deserve. and are given. special tax treatment. However. our present law makes no distinction between assets held for one year and those held for 50. Instead of addressing himself to this lapse. the president aimed a potshot at millionaires who make quick capital gains. What he hit were the longterm investments of the elderly. Legislators aware of the illogic in the present law have suggested that tax rates be scaled to the period for which an asset is held. Mr. Carter has taken no notice of this reform. Surely a widow who makes $60.000 on her house after 35 years should be taxed at a lower rate than a person who makes $60.000 in a single year. but present tax laws would give her only limited help. Surely a worker who retires after 35 years and cashes in his company stock or his profitsharing should be taxed at a lower rate than a person who makes the same amount in the stock market in a single year. But instead of attempting to remedy these inequities. the president used intemperate language calculated to turn capital gain into an epithet. as If it were an underhanded scheme to defraud the poor. If Mr. Carter wants to do something constructive. he will send Congress a capital gains reform proposal more in keeping with his populist rhetoric of campaign days. The highest tax rate should be on assets held for only one year. the lowest rate on gains made over a period of 50 years. The years between 1 and 50 should be taxed on a sliding scale. Profit is not unAmerican. Mr. President. Gain is not a dirty word. When you take aim at those awful millionaires. please make sure you dont hit the little guys who elected you. [From the Wall Street Journal. June 28. 19781 TwoBIT POLITICS In a press conference reminiscent of the ""war profiteering"" attack on the Oil companies last fall. President Carter Monday aimed his populist heavy cannons at the Steiger amendment. calling it a plan that provides ""huge tax windfalls for millionaires and two bits for the average American."" When you consider that 60odd Senators and a sizable chunk of the House are backing the SteigerHansen capital gains rollback. the Presidents claim takes on a burden of political implausibility. Millionaires dont have that many friends in Congress In an election year. Matters get worse for the President when you examine the numbers he used in support of his populist rhetoric. For example. he again trotted out the estimate that the Steiger cut would ""add more than $2 billion"" to the federal budget deficit. This is based on the improbable assumption that cutting the maximum capital gains rate roughly in half would not encourage people to take more capital gains. Considering the beating that assumption has taken from tax analysts and economists. we thought it had been hidden away in a dark closet somewhere. As we have said here before. a good case can be made that revenues would rise. not fall. because of renewed investment incentives. We are newly fascinated by the Presidents assertion that 80% of the tax benefits from the Steiger cut would go to taxpayers who ""make"" more than $100.000 a year. Weve learned what that $100.000 figure really means. and you dont have to be a big shot to ""make"" that much under the Presidents definition. The $100.000 figure is what the Treasury has defined as ""expanded income."" a description developed by tax reformers some time ago for political purposes. Expanded income means ordinary income plus the full amount of any capital gain. Thus. it would be possible for a family with an ordinary income of $25.000 and a capital gain of. say. $75.000 on the sale of a longterm residence to be part of that illustrious group ""making"" $100.000. We wonder why that point wasnt made clearer. As to that ""average"" American who only gets two bits from Steiger. it is certainly true that you have to have a capital gain to benefit from a capital gains tax cut. And when you average all taxpayers the average benefit doesnt look very large. Indeed. the yield to the Treasury itself from the capital gains tax isnt very large. particularly in relation to the damage the tax does to capital formation. But none of this means that the Steiger amendment would not yield major benefits to ordinary. nonrich Americans who have to cash a major asset and find themselves. mainly because of inflation. realizing a sizable capital gain. By way of illustration. we asked accountants Price Waterhouse & Co. and Oscar Pollack of the Ingalls and Snyder securities house in New York to work up some examples: A New York cabbie paid $24.000 for his licensing medallion five years ago and now sells it for $58.000. His total longterm capital gain is $34.000. His earned income was $13.200. excluding the capital gain. He has a wife and two children. Under the present law his federal income tax liability would be $8.850. With the Steiger amendment. it would be $7.800. a saving of $1.050. A California construction project manager and his wife. in their early 60s with a taxable earned income of $25.000. want to retire on a pension and Social Security. They sell their house and rent an apartment. They bought their house 20 years ago for $24.000 and now sell it for $100.000. for a longterm capital gain of $76.000. They dont qualify for income averaging because of higher earned income in prior years. Their total tax liability under present provisions would be $26.064. Under the Steiger amendment it would be $22.014. for a saving of $4.050. An Iowan who helped build a successful hardware retailing business wants to sell his halfinterest to his partner for $100.000. His original capital contribution was $10.000 and the full $90.000 difference qualifies as a capital gain. He will have investment income of $15.000 in the year he sells. He does not qualify for income average because of higher income in prior years. His present liability would be $25.650. His tax under Steiger would be $20.400. a savings of $5.250. It will be noted that none of the above are millionaires. They are ordinary individuals forced by circumstances to take a capital gain in grossly inflated dollars. and who. under present law. would pay a heavy tax on inflation. Obviously. the Congress understands all this better than the President. Backers of the Steiger amendment might be forgiven if they categorized the statements at the Monday press conference as twobit politics.\n'",continue exhortation class warfare attack capital_gain tax

On the contrary. they indicate that the ICA. in the past 4 years. lost fewer0.50and hired 7 more per 100 employees than the other Federal agencies. The conclusion is that ICA. the principal foreign aid agency. is growing considerably faster and losing less personnel annually than the other Federal agencies. Mr. President. democracy has never been achieved in any country until the people through their elected representatives controlled the purse strings of government. The two great democracies of the world are the United Kingdom and the United States. Neither one gained this status except through a struggle to throw off the bonds of despotism. and neither country has retained this priceless possession except through continued watchfulness and resistance to erosive maneuvering. It was over 400 years after the signing of the Magna Carta that the British Parliament wrested any control of appropriations from the Crown. Only after the glorious revolution of 1688 did the English people begin to control the policies of government. and it has been only during the last 70 years that the House of Commons has exercised tight control over governmental expenditures. In America. Congress has had control over the public purse from the beginning. since the Constitution placed the fiscal power of the Nation in Congress. not in the executive. The fact that the framers of the Constitution had the wisdom to create a government of checks and balances. and to place the fiscal power in the elected representatives of the people has not prevented the executive branch of Government from frequently trying to usurp this power. Even as early as 1793. Congress found it necessary to adopt a resolution. offered by Representative Giles. of Virginia. stating: Resolved. That It is essential to the due administration of the Government of the United States. that laws making specific appropriations of money should be strictly observed by the administrator of the finances thereof.

Jr.. national legal holiday from January 15 to the third Monday in January of each year. As we have heard in the general debate. and as we recognize. a very serious question arises with regard to establishing a new national legal holiday. The question of cost. the economic effect which this would have on the Federal Government for which this proposed new national legal holiday would be established should be answered. American industry and business which is likewise bound to be affected by the action that we are taking here in the House today is also of prime importance. We know that 13 States have already established a State holiday for the Rev. Martin Luther King. Jr.. and a number of cities have established his birthday as city holidays. Even without any legislation. the observance of Martin Luther Kings birthday seems to be carried out generally throughout our country. Many of us here on the floor can recall the Monday holiday legislation which we enacted in 1968. and when we undertook with respect to George Washingtons birthday to designate the third Monday in February of each year for the purpose of observing George Washingtons birthday. I know that we want to accord great respect and honor to Rev. Martin Luther King by this legislation. but at the same time we want to minimize the adverse economic effect which such an additional legal holiday would have. The evidence was overwhelming at the time we enacted the Monday holiday legislation that the closing down of businesses on a Tuesday to observe a legal holiday caused great economic detriment on the Monday preceding the holiday and likewise the day following the holiday. As a matter of fact. in some union contracts there are special penalties imposed against those who fail to appear for work on the day preceding or following a national legal holiday. But where the holiday is observed on a Monday and there is a 3daylong weekend. the workers come back to their jobs refreshed. the plant has not had to close down the day before. and the economic detriment is greatly reduced. This way the testimony which was presented to the House Committee on the Judiciary. at the time the Monday holiday legislation was enacted. testimony presented by a Deputy Secretary of the Department of Commerce. [] 1610 The record is replete with evidence that business and industry is greatly benefited by a Monday holiday in lieu of a midweek holiday. The absenteeism is tremendous on the days preceding and following holidays. for instance. if the holiday is observed on a Tuesday. Wednesday or Thursday is a day on which a great many workers stay off the job. Mr. Chairman. when we think of the economic situation. when we think of the subject of the productivity which is going to occur when a person returns from a long weekend and is ready to go to work and handle the job. we must recognize that the subject of the economy. productivity. the question of inflation are answered substantially or could be answered substantially by the adoption of this amendment and by the designation of Martin Luther Kings birthday as a Monday holiday. May I just say finally. the observance on a Monday provides a better opportunity for the observance than when it occurs in the middle of the week. Not only the preparation for the holiday. but the knowledge that the holiday is going to occur on a certain specified day each year. Mr. Chairman. the opportunity to travel to sites which are associated with the person are also enhanced. The opportunities to come here to Washington and be at the Lincoln Memorial where the Reverend Martin Luther King uttered his great speech which electrified the entire country and which hundreds of thousands observed as well as the millions who observed it on television. So we can commemorate the memory of the Reverend Martin Luther King through this national holiday better by having it as a Monday holiday. Mr. Chairman. I am pleased. indeed. that my colleague from New Jersey . the chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary. joins in this. I understand the author of the legislation also concurs.\n',amendment committee amendment change date observance national legal holiday third year hear general debate recognize serious question arise regard establish new national legal holiday question cost economic effect propose new national legal holiday establish answer american industry business bind affect action take today prime importance know state establish holiday number city establish birthday city holiday legislation observance king_birthday seem carry country many floor recall holiday legislation enact undertake respect birthday designate third year purpose observe birthday know want accord great respect honor legislation same time want minimize_adverse economic effect additional legal holiday evidence overwhelming time enact holiday legislation closing business observe legal holiday cause great economic detriment precede holiday day follow holiday matter fact union contract special penalty impose fail appear work day precede follow national legal holiday holiday observe weekend worker come job refresh plant close day economic detriment reduce way testimony present time holiday legislation enact testimony present record replete evidence business industry benefit holiday lieu midweek_holiday absenteeism tremendous day precede follow holiday instance holiday observe day great many worker stay job think economic situation think subject productivity go occur person return long weekend ready go work handle job recognize subject economy productivity question inflation answer answer adoption amendment designation king_birthday holiday say observance provide well opportunity observance occur middle week preparation holiday knowledge holiday go occur certain_specified day year opportunity travel site associate person enhance opportunity come utter great speech electrify entire country hundred_thousand observe million observe television commemorate memory national holiday have holiday pleased colleague chairman join understand author legislation,96.0,bound,1,0

As far as being somejhing we do not need because the Park Police are already out there with their horses. let me state that the Capitol grounds are statutorily defined. and because of that the Park Police do not have jurisdictions over the Capitol grounds. it is my understanding. This program has only been in existence and operational since May of 2004. The GAO study. as the chairman stated. said that it is hard for them to quantify the benefits of the horse patrol because the performance measures are evolving. he failed to say the rest of it. and that data is still being collected on these measures. So we are trying to get rid of something that we have not even given a chance to see if it works. We are talking about $155.000. I am quoting from the GAO results that they gave when they appeared before the Committee on Appropriations. The horses right now are housed. I beard my colleague from Virginia say earlier. that they were housed 20 miles away. That is correct. they are. And he says that they have to be under stress whenever they are in traffic. Well. I am a horsewoman. I have seven horses of my own. Let me tell you. it does not cost me $155.000 for seven horses. We have five horses here. and it certainly does not cost threequarters of a million dollars. and we do not have to provide health benefits and retirement and the like to the horses. I think we are cutting short a program that we have not given a chance. I urge my colleagues to support my amendment. I think it is a good cause. I think the horses do a great job. It is great PR for us. I see folks going up and talking to our Capitol Police Officers. Yes. the police officers do have the bicycles. but I would venture to say the guys on the bicycles are not sitting up as higli as the guys and gals on top of the horses.

The text of the draft nonproliferation treaty presented by the United States and the U.S.S.R. to the 18nation Disarmament Conference January 18 is the result of many years of persistent. patient and conscientious effort to devise an agreement which promotes the security of all mankind. As a congressional adviser to the 18nation Disarmament Conference. I have followed the course of these negotiations with great interest. Devising a means to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons is the most urgent task of our time. The danger implicit in the indiscriminate proliferation of these weapons is clear. If we fail to continue the search for a way to contain the spread of nuclear weapons. then it will ultimately matter little what other progress we achieve. The momentum attained by agreement on a draft nonproliferation treaty must be sustained through continued congressional support for the operations of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. I sponsored a bill to establish the Agency and I believe its continued pursuit of peace and security must be encouraged and supported by the Congress.\n',receive propose legislation extend life year proposal come auspicious time engage major effort obtain agreement treaty prohibit spread nuclear_weapon milestone effort reach last week agree complete draft nonproliferation_treaty include safeguard article text draft nonproliferation_treaty present result many year persistent patient conscientious effort devise agreement promote security mankind congressional adviser follow course negotiation great interest devise means prevent spread nuclear_weapon urgent task time danger implicit indiscriminate proliferation weapon clear fail continue search way contain spread nuclear_weapon matter little other progress achieve momentum attain agreement draft nonproliferation_treaty sustain continue congressional support operation sponsor bill establish believe continued pursuit peace security encourage support,90.0,bound,1,0

This was to be accomplished by furnishing depositories where those people who are suspicious of the ordinary banks of deposit could place their savings in perfect confidence that they would incur no risk of loss. It was thought that this sense of security would not only encourage the savings habit. but that it also would bring hoarded savings from their hiding places. which. through deposit with the Government and redeposit by the Government in the local banks. would reenforce the actual available circulation of the community. The system so established is now patronized. as I am informed. up to the sum of $40.000.000. There is no question that these deposits are exempt from seizure on execution. I believe they are exempt from all forms of local taxation. When the bill was before the Senate I submitted to Senator Carter. of Montana. who was in charge of the measure. the question whether the certificate of deposit contemplated by the bill would not. under then existing law. be exempt from State and local taxation. He replied that in his opinion It would.

I have had my colleagues on both sides of this say there ought to be one flat rate. I remember the Senator from Arizona had a great plan. I think a 15percent rate. one 15percent rate. no exemptions and deductions. Now the Senator from Nebraska wants to go back and have instead of one rate. he wants three rates. What we have. in effect. is a 15percent and 28percent flat rate. Nobody pays more than 28 percent. We have some who want to keep that 15 percent. one flat rate. We all received hundreds and thousands of postcards saying we ought to have a flat rate tax. That was 4 or 5 years ago. Let us do not start the other way. and putting back all the deductions and loading up the code and have 15 brackets again. Let us do it one way or the other. I will conclude by making again the point of the bubble. and I will be happy to yield the floor. I want to -reread this portion of a letter I had .rom a lady in Charlotte. NC. The .me is Mary Harding. It said: Senator. I am neither a Democrat nor a Republican. Nor am I a registered voter. I am one of those many who have given up on both parties and said ""A Pox On Both Your Houses"". This has been the result of my being convinced by the Democrats and the press that the Republicans are the party of the rich. and my own observations that the Democrats are the party of the Giveaway. I had grown convinced lately that the only hope of the country was the formation of a third party. And this is the key paragraph: I. like everyone else. had bought the argument that the rich were paying less taxes than everyone else. but you were so evidently telling the truth that I decided to get on my computer and find out for myself. You will not be surprised to find out you were right. She happened to be watching on CSPAN last week. where I was trying to explain the bubble. challenging the press to tell the truth about the bubble. So far the New York Times has responded. That is it. She went on to say: I am a far cry from being the tax expert to which you appealed yesterday.. actually Im unemployed. but I am sending you. with this letter. an analysis I made of earnings ratio to effective tax rate based on the 1989 Employers Tax GuideTable 7Page 23Married Person. (I am sorry I dont have a 1990 guide available). I also calculated the effect on taxes if the highest rate was changed from 28% to 33%. This clearly demonstrates. as you stated. that the purpose of the 1986 tax reform act was to gradually Increase the effective tax rate up to 28% at which time it becomes stable for all earnings higher. That was the purpose. Now we find some of the architects of that famous piece of legislationI was not one of the major architectson the other side of the aisle. I assume to be saying we did not mean what we were saying in 1986. Let us go back and have a third rate. stick in more deduction. more exemptions for the rich. I suggest we have a pretty good Tax Code. It is progressive and what people said they wanted around here for years. Some wanted one rate. and we got two rates. Now we are being told we want three rates. I wish the Senator from Nebraska and others who want to talk about that rate would talk about the $30 billion tax on the working people in the Ways and Means package which is going to pass the House floor today. It is a $30 billion tax on working people taken right out of their check. I am afraid. as I said earlier. it is a habit the Democrats cannot seem to break. they want to tax everybody. everything that moves tax it and then go around and talk about the Republicans being for the rich because you know the media is going to repeat it for you. But the facts are facts. If you are working. and the Rostenkowski plan should pass. then you are in trouble. because you have lost indexing of your exemptions and the brackets and you are going to pay for it forever Just for a measly $30 billion they are going to take out of the hide of working people.

They were thrilled also by the resolute and stirring addresses giving testimony to the world that this House and this country are determined to fight this war through to a complete. early. and permanent victory. However. in that connection I call attention of the Congress to the fact that up to this time at least this Congress has not provided any forum or body or jury to which can be submitted the numerous proposals which are adrift in the country today as to how we can get this type of permanent peace for which we all pray. Today I introduced in the House a joint resolution known as House Joint Resolution 28. My resolution proposes the creation of a postwar planning commission to study the various problems confronting this Republic. both from the standpoint of international policy and from the standpoint of our domestic economy. I recall as a boy hearing a poem that went something like this: I shot an arrow into the air. It fell to earth. I know not where. It seems to me that today a lot of ideas. some good and some bad. have been shot into the air. and nobody knows where they are going to fall. or whether they will ever contact realism. because no proving ground is provided for the conduct of a careful. realistic. and analytical study with respect to the value of these proposals. Up until Pearl Harbor we had two groups of opinion in this Nation. which for want of better names were called interventionists and isolationists. Since Pearl Harbor we have happily had only one point of view in this country. and that may be called the indomitables. because we are firmly united and we are indomitable in our crusade for victory. However. we must in some manner f ashion our thoughts and measure our views as to what is best to do in our postwar policies. as we assume our rightful position in the world of affairs. We must eliminate the blind spots in the thinking of a lot of people speaking on the subject today who apparently fail to recognize a relationship between our foreign policy and our domestic economy. neither can operate in a vacuum. Somebody said one time that the most dangerous thing in the world is the void created by the loss of a religion. I think there is a lot of truth in that. I also imagine that it is highly dangerous for a nation to operate in a void created by the loss of an accepted and acknowledged foreign policy. Consequently. I would like to help contribute to the elimination of such a hazardthe elimination of such a voidby the creation of a biparty. nonpolitical. nonsensational. realistic commission to study the problems of an acceptable American foreign policy following the war. to help crystallize our peace objectives. and to consider our domestic problems related thereto.

I rise in opposition to this amendment. This misguided amendment would prohibit additional Federal investment in Californias highspeed rail project. As we know. California is in the midst of constructing the Nations first truly highspeed rail system. The project was approved by a strong majority of California voters in 2008 because we Californians know that highspeed rail is the most effective and environmentally sustainable way to increase mobility across the State. Now. the project is already creating jobs for Californians. In fact. more than 70 firms that have committed to performing work on this project have offices in the Central Valley. and many of these firms. happily. are veteranowned. In San Jose. the California highspeed rail project is already providing immediate benefits by investing $1.5 billion in the Caltrain Modernization Program. This program will create over 9.500 jobs. over 90 percent in the San Francisco Bay area. Now. the governments independent watchdog. the GAO. conducted an extensive audit of the project. And you know what? They gave high marks to the authoritys business plan for highspeed rail. Members of Congress are right to conduct proper oversight of infrastructure projects across the country. However. regardless of your views on the merits of this project. I think most of us would agree that attempting to kill a single project through the appropriations process is bad public policy and sets a horrible precedent. I would note that electrified trains are really part of the future. China already has 5.000 miles of highspeed rail. and they intend to double that. Spain has 1.600 miles of highspeed rail. and they are building more. More than a dozen other countries have their own successful highspeed rail systems. Even Morocco is building a highspeed rail system. But we dont have anything in the United States except for what California is doing. I would note that California is almost always on the leading edge of progress for our country. We are leading in energy conservation. We are leading in alternative energy. and we have the best public university. the University of California. in the entire United States. We always lead. Now. it is important that the State of California has identified an ongoing source of funds to support highspeed rail. and that is the capandtrade funds. Is that appropriate? Yes. it is. because the capandtrade funds are generated through energy conservation. and the highspeed rail system is going to help move Californians in an environmentally suitable way. It is important to be visionary here. You know. when we started building the interstate highway system. when the first mile of highway was built. we didnt know that 50 years later we would still be identifying interstates to build. We need to begin with highspeed rail in California. California is behind this project. The California Democratic delegation is behind this project. I urge my colleagues to reject the amendment. put our neighbors back to work. and allow California to continue building the Nations first true highspeed rail project. We will all be proud of that project as it nears completion. Mr. Chairman.

Mr. President. that in the course of the committee hearings. on page 239. in response to the same kind of argument that the distinguished Senator from Rhode Island has just given here. Secretary Nitze said: With respect to the bombing. the large item here is the increase in B52 sorties. That arose principally because of the North Vietnamese threat to Khesanh. I would hardly say that the successful defense of Khesanh could be called an escalation. This Senator replied to Secretary Nitze: That is absolutely right. But to follow through. you said that you expected to be able to maintain a substantially higher rate [deleted] as compared to [deleted] sorties you had programed. with a readiness to go to [deleted]. This indicates an escalation over what you planned. Secretary NrrzE. It is true that this program is an increase over what we had planned in January. and a substantial increase. because one of the items that makes it higher is the B52 sorties. My point is that it is a sustained escalation over what they had planned in January. They were able to meet the Khesanh problem with what had been programed. authorized. and appropriated before. Now they are asking for a much bigger appropriationand I mean much biggerto provide what seems to me to be a situation in which we are likely to have very serious destruction in South Vietnam. that could badly hurt us. Mr. President. apropos of the Buchwald column. there comes a time when the city council must recognize that there are other ways of getting ""Charlie"" out of the house than turning the house to rubble. even if the chief of police cannot understand that. Our chief does not see it this way. so it is up to this city council. the Senate. to act. Again. we are not stopping B52 bombing in South Vietnam. Far from it. This amendment would simply draw the line at a very high level. a very high level indeed. of sorties and tonnage. a level far. far above the tonnage delivered on all of Europe at the peak of World War II. This is an amendment to attempt to see that there is something left in South Vietnam after this war is over. Some Senators may argue. Mr. President. that this is an exaggeration of the true situation in Vietnamthat we are not destroying the country by our bombing. Well. Mr. President. I call the Senates attention to a letter written last August by a North Vietnamese Catholic priest to a fellow priest in France that spells out what the bombing has done to the churches in just one part of North Vietnam. This letter is not a report from South Vietnam. It is from North Vietnam. written before the President at the end of March of this year limited North Vietnamese bombing. Since that time the bombing has been concentrated on South Vietnam. And the kind of destruction that our bombing visited on North Vietnamand then someis being concentrated now in South Vietnam. We should note especially what this means for South Vietnam. because it had already borne about half of the bombing. After all. in South Vietnam is where most of the military action has been. Now with the limitation on bombing the north. and especially with the bombing escalation for which this supplemental provides. the ruin and destruction in South Vietnam will far. far outpace that of the north. This letter spells out what our bombing has done in the north. The letter appeared in a very small publication distributed to a select group of Catholics who migrated from the north in 1954. The letter in Tinh MeMotherland Newsappeared in the November 28. 1967. issue. Sent through France to Saigon. it was distributed by Archbishop Binh to several Vietnamese priests. who later published it in the Tinh Me. The archbishop. according to the same source. sent the letter to Pope Paul VI.

I do not believe that the constraints of the Presidents campaigning for Republican candidates prior to the election allowed for adequate comprehension of these problems affecting our people. I. for one. believe the Presidents call for this ""lameduck"" session was wise. But why is the President now visiting South and Central American countries at this particular time when the problems here in the United States should be addressed? Surely the President should be advised by all of us that the stark. bleak domestic economy does not warrant more giveaways to our hemispheric neighbors to the south until the U.S. economy recovers.

Surely the President should be advised by all of us that we can no longer avoid nor delay to implement prompt steps for economic recovery. with our attention focused on problems here in the United States.

Those who support the Federal flexitime bill. as I do. should understand that adoption of the Armstrong amendment will seriously jeopardize the prospects for enacting the flexitime bill before the current authorizaLion expires next month. The Armstrong amendment is not germane to the bill before us. If adopted it will have to be referred to two House committees and it is extremely unlikely that House action can be completed before the deadline. Moreover the chairman of the House Post Office and Civil Service Committee has made it clear that he will not act on a Senate passed bill which includes a WalshHealy amendment. Beyond that there is absolutely no excuse for addressing the WalshHealy issue today. The Labor Subcommittee completed hearings on WalshHealy on March 10. 1981. The bill was reported to the full committee on July 9. It has languished there for 12 months. The Armstrong amendment is nothing more than an attempt to disrupt the orderly procedures of the Senate by circumventing the committee structure. There is simply no justification for proceeding in this manner when no one on the Labor Committee is preventing consideration of the bill under normal procedures. Adoption of the Armstrong amendment will not result in flexitime work schedules in the private sector because it will not become law f attached to this bill. Instead. the likely consequence will be to deny the benefits of the Federal program to thousands upon thousands of Federal workers because no bill will be enacted. Every Member of this body should understand that a vote for the Armstrong amendment is a vote against the Federal flexitime bill.

So the Senator is now surrendering when he proposes to pick a price somewhere between the price we would pay and the current world market price. So he compliments the Senate committee by his amendment in suggesting that he would not wish Latin people to sell it at the world market price. because he knows that would be ridiculous. He now says that the world market price for 15 years. which is really taking the world market price and advancing it by 1 cent. The Senator says that if we take out the 15year average. including those years when the price of sugar went through the sky under the Douglas amendment. we will get a price which is reasonable. He believes that would be approximately correct. based on his logic and intention. He has concluded that would be a fair price for sugar. Now that is what the Senator thinks. I do not know where he gets his economics. but he will not find a single witness to testifyat least. I have not found anyone who willthat 4.2 cents a pound would permit our trading partners in the world to make a profit. This Nation does not care to trade with its trading partners on a basis that they could not make enough money to pay for expenses except by squeezing the lifeblood out of pitiful peons working in caneflelds. In trading with Cuba. we arrived at an agreement on price. under the Sugar Act which is now in existence. That was during the time when Cuba was almost entirely dependent upon the United States for everything it imported. That was the time when Americans used practically the entire production of sugar in Cuba. From the time Cuba was taken over by the Communists. we said that we would let other friendly countries have the same arrangement we had with Cuba. when we felt a direct responsibility for that countrys economy. Thus. we permitted those people to trade for a price which was fair to us and fair to them. Those countries would like to continue to trade with us. They like the arrangement. and we like it. We tried an import fee. as the Senator has stated. It was extremely unpopular. The countries felt that we were asking them to sell their sugar below the cost of production. We helped to stabilize the price of coffee as a result of the coffee agreement for which the Senate voted. although the Senator from Illinois opposed it. That was to see if the countries could make enough selling coffee to stay in business. The President got the Latin American Ambassadors to come to the White House to discuss the Alliance for Progress. They took beautiful color pictures. They talked about the fine efforts and achievements of the Alliance for Progress. Then. in the course of the discussion. we said that we were going to see to it that the socalled import fee of the Douglas amendment was eliminated. The President said this in the speech he made to the Ambassadors. which included every Latin American country: First. we must maintain our steps to prevent disastrous changes in the price of these basic commodities which are the lifeblood of so many economies. We will continue. as we did conclude in London. the operations of the Coffee Agreement and to search for ways to stabilize the price of cocoa. We will try to maintain regularly expanded markets for the sugar produced In Latin America and consistent with the CIAP recommendations. I will propose this afternoon that Congress eliminate the special import fee on sugar so that the fall price will go to Latin American producers. I am sure that a part of the Presidents speech met with a vast ovation from our partners in the Organization of American States. The President sent them all a picture. Here is one taken in the flower garden. with the President sitting with the senior members of the Latin American countriesthe senior diplomatic delegates here. and the representatives of every Latin American country in the flower garden. This document is beautifully printed in gold leaf. on beautiful white stationery of the finest quality. and inside are the pictures. I am sure that the Latin American delegates sent it to every friend they had in Latin America. including their President and their Congress. saying. ""Look how well I have done with the President. We came down and explained our problem to him. how badly we were being treated under the Douglas amendment. and the President. thank the merciful Lord. is going to declare an end to that. Look how well the President is going to treat us. Look what a fine job we have done representing our country."" Notwithstanding the wonderful speech made by the President. notwithstanding the meeting at Punta del Este. where we said we were going to help them stabilize the price of their basic commodities. notwithstanding the commitments. notwithstanding the beautiful pictures the President sent to the Latin American Ambassadors where he signed all these statements. the Senator from Illinois now suggests that we break our word and tell those people that we are going to get sugar from them at a price below their cost of production. What could be more unpopular at a time when we are trying to get the OAS to uphold our hand and work with us as a partner to help solve the Communist problem in Cuba. and to help keep the Dominican Republic from going Communist. and then for Uncle Sam to be pictured around the world. even by our best friends and our -usual traditional trading customers. as a sort of tophatted. overnourished. wealthy man with a diamond stickpin in his tie. squeezing the lifeblood out of Latin American peons to make them produce and deliver sugar to him below their cost of living. I believe that this would be the most unpopular thing that anyone could dream of. Yet the Senator suggested this idea to Thomas Mann. our former Ambassador to Mexico. who served at the State Department Latin American desk for a great many years and is a State Department expert on these matters. The Senator suggested that we squeeze this money out of the sugar producers and give it back to them as direct aid to their government under the Alliance for Progress. Ambassador Mann said: Senator. if I had my choice. I would rather have you take $60 million of aid away from the Alliance for Progress countries than to try to pick up $30 million this way. I think the injury you would do to the image of America. and to our good will. the friends you would lose would be so great and hurt us so badly that I would rather you took the $60 million away from the Alliance for Progress countries than to make $30 million by this scheme. I am happy to say that the Senator has finally seen the light. So. he comes before us now and suggests that we no longer do this to our Latin American partners but take some other poor devil and do it to him. So. what have we to work on? India is a very poor nation. We give them a large amount of foreign aid. recognizing the many problems they have. They probably are near the top of the list for aid. But when we had a shortage of sugar. and called on India to sell its sugar to us. India came through and delivered 230.000 tons of sugar when she could have made a better price to someone else. However. she delivered that sugar to us. So here is a Senator who has made an outstanding record in voting against discrimination saying that. so far as the people in this hemisphere are concerned. let us give them a price that we think is fair. but so far as the Indians are concerned. let us take away from them the price they would have received if they had been able to trade with us in the normal way. We are going to pay them less than we pay the others. The Senators proposal would do that in spite of the fact that. since the enactment of the Sugar Act. we have committed ourselves to GATT. in which we stated that we would treat all favored nations alike. and India is one of them. We would be breaking our word under GATT. because we would be giving India a low price while a higher price is paid to the others. What are some of the other nations that the Senator from Illinois would discriminate against? Australia is one of them. We are in a death struggle in Vietnam. trying to resist Communist aggression. One of the few countries which came to our aid in that struggle over there happens to be Australia. Australia even sent troops there. to fight and die alongside our troops. The people who would be favored by the Senators amendment do not even have any representatives there. and I do not see why we should be paying them a better price than we pay to Australia. which happens to be one of our best friends. The committee reduced the amount that was made available to the Fiji Islands. Those people acted magnificently at a time of sugar shortage. They could have made more money by selling sugar to someone else. So here are the Indiansnobody could be poorerand the Senators amendment would take away from them to give to the Alliance for Progress. I am in favor of helping nations that are less better off. but if we are to have a foreign aid program. it does not make sense to tax the poorest people in the world under a foreign aid program in which to help people who are better off. The Senators amendment would place a tax on the Fiji Islands to help somebody who may be better off. This amendment is a tax on farmers and laborers of Africa and India to benefit countries in Latin America. It is a tax the Communists can increase at any time it chooses by dumping the sugar on the world market. thereby forcing the world price down. because the Communists have the sugar available to dump. The proposal would eliminate any Incentive a country would have to sell us sugar. This could lead to instability of our sugar supplies and could operate contrary to the longterm interest of our consumers. It would not benefit consumers in this country. Prices would not be cut by reason of the recapture. They could well go up as instability of prices lead to shortages. Inasmuch as the money under the Senators proposal would go into the Alliance for Progress. it would not benefit the taxpayers or the consumers. The amendment would make the United States the only country in the world. so far as I know. that would force farmers and laborers of a large part of the world to accept a distress price for what they sell us while other nations pay a premium for their sugar. Furthermore. the amendment would force planters in a large part of the world to cut the wages they pay their laborers in the sugar fields. They would have to do this to cut their costs of production. This is essential because the world price is below the cost of production fourfifths of the time. Not even a 15year average world price is sufficient to cover the cost of production. The arrangement the committee has brought to the Senate was carefully studied by the administration. It has been studied down through the years. It has been studied by the industry. It is an arrangement which is advantageous to both sides. That. after all. is what we want to do. We do not want a deal that is good for us but bad for the other fellow. or vice versa. We should seek an arrangement that is favorable to both sides. I would like to put into the RECORD a letter written by Mr. COOLEY to the Speaker of the House. Hon. JOHN W. McCORMACK. He explains in this letter why he thought that this proposed arrangement would be disastrous. He explains that he thinks the proposal for the import fee is illegal. immoral. and unsound economics. and why it would break faith with our commitments. He mentions the fact that It is opposed by Mr. Mann. He ends the letter with this paragraph: This proposal for an import fee on sugar is illegal. immoral. unsound economics. an insult to our friends in Latin America. and would result in the eventual breakdown of our sugar program. I will not introduce a bill containing this proposal and if it is advanced I will do my utmost to defeat it in the committee. in the House. and in conference with the Senate. I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the RECORD at this point.\n'",retreat own argument surrender propose pick price price pay current world market price compliment committee

The economists call Dr. Roberts ideas supply side theory. I call it commonsense. It has been the basis for some of the most important legislative initiatives in the last two Congresses. It underlies the groundswell of sentiment in favor of taxrate reduction. It is. in these times of grim economic statistics and puny economic programs. our last. best hope to get America back on the track again. back on the high road to its destiny. But this is not a speech about tax cuts. It is both a tribute and a welcome. For while giving Craig his due. I am pleased to announce that he is returning to Washington from his recent post as associate editor and columnist of the Wall Street Journal. He has been appointed senior fellow in political economy at the Georgetown University Center for Strategic and International Studies. where he joins the company of other seniorscholars who include Henry Kissinger and James Schlesinger. It is good to have Craig return to the scene of the crimes. The crimes. that is. of escalating taxes. hideous inflation. rigged Federal budgets. and worsening unemployment: the entire litany of woe that has resulted from perverse mismanagement of our economy. It will be even better to have his counsel and leadership in our future efforts to set things straight: To remove the burden of Big Brother from the backs of the American workers. to keep the greedy hand of Government out of the purses of housewives and the pocketbooks of retirees. I will not speculate as to the further future. But just as I am confident of the good sense of the American people. just as I am convinced of the merits of their tax revolt. so too am I certain that the November elections. and decisions made subsequent thereunto. will bring Dr. Roberts the sweetest triumphwhat John Greenleaf Whittier called ""the safe appeal of Truth to Time.""

It is a bill designed to release mineral royalty receipts to Colorado where the receipts were generated from gas development within this reserve on the western slope near Rifle. Colorado. By way of background. in 1997. Congress transferred the federal Naval Oil Shale Reserve lands in western Colorado from the U.S. Department of Energy. DOE. to the U.S. Bureau of Land Management. BLM. and directed the BLM to begin leasing the oil and gas resources under these lands. The Transfer Act also directed that the royalties recouped from this leasing program be set aside and the state portion not disbursed to Colorado until the Interior Department and the DOE certified that enough money from the royalty receipts accrued to satisfy two purposes. The first was to provide funding to clean up the Anvil Points site on these lands. Anvil Points was an oil shale research facility that operated within the Naval Oil Shale Reserve for about 40 years. The facility was operated by DOE at one point. and private industry performed research there under contract. Waste material was produced at this facility from oil shale mining and processing. That waste accumulated in a pile of about 300.000 cubic yards of spent oil shale and other materialincluding arsenic and other heavy metalswhich rests on slopes below the facility. The second purpose was for the reimbursement of certain costs related to the transfer. Following the transfer to the BLM. this area experienced significant natural gas leasing and. as a result. significant royalty revenue was generated. On August 8. 2008. the DOI and DOE certified that adequate funds had accrued to accomplish the goals of cleanup and cost reimbursement and subsequently allocated all royalty revenue generated after this date according to the Mineral Leasing Act. which establishes that Colorado receive a proportionate share. However. considerably more revenue accrued than was necessary to accomplish the cleanup and cost reimbursement goals. This bill would direct that this additional royalty revenue be allocated to Colorado according to the formulas and processes established for the disbursement of federal mineral royalties under the Mineral Leasing Act. The bill also directs that the Colorado share of this remaining royalty revenue be allocated to the two Counties directly impacted by oil and gas leasing on the Naval Oil Shale Reserve landsspecifically. Garfield and Rio Blanco Counties. The bill further requires that the royalties be used to address these impacts through activities such as land and water restoration. road repair. and other capital improvement projects. Based on figures provided by the BLM. there remains approximately $17 million in these accounts for Colorados royalty revenue share. This bill would make Colorado whole and provide it with its rightful share of the remaining royalty revenue to address critical local needs and impacts from the very leasing that produced the royalty revenue.

I want to congratulate the gentleman from Missouri on his leadership in initiating this discussion and in proposing some time ago that our national manpower situation be investigated by a Joint Committee To Study the Facts Relating to the Draft. As a member of the Committee on Armed Services. which has periodically recommended the extension of the peacetime draft since I have been in the House. as former Reserve officer of more than 30 years duty and as a commanding officer of thousands of draftees during World War II. I have had a long and continuing interest in military conscription. At the outset I would grant that conscription is not popular. it is something we tolerate during times of emergency. In times of peace. even a cold war peace. if it is more distasteful to require military service of our young men. Yet we have recognized the necessity of such service because of the continuing threat of Communist aggression. I for one believe that our determination to remain strong and prepared has done much to prevent aggression and hostilities since the end of World War II. We have come now to the point where we are suggesting that it is time that our whole concept of the draft be reviewed. We need not make any prejudgments as to what such a study will show. It is enough to recognize that the present system is far from ideal. It may be the best we can do. but in the national interest a thorough review is worthwhile. This session was planned weeks ago. as you may imagine. It was heartening to those of us who have had this subject on our minds for some time to hear the Presidents statement over the weekend. for it indicates that he. too. has realized the need for a review of our manpower utilization problems. Looking at the present draft system strictly in terms of national security. many questions arise: Does this system provide the services with the skilled technicians they require? Does it help or hinder the services in keeping skilled men? Does the morale and motivation of men who have been drafted or who have volunteered under the pressure of the draft suffer to a significant degree? Do the present regulations allow some needed men to escape service? Are there more equitable ways of distributing the burdens of service which would eliminate some of the present feelings of resentment caused by seeming favoritism? Do the short terms of service and the constant turnover in personnel substantially effect service strength and efficiency? Are most draftees brought into service at an age higher than the services would prefer? Is the time of the men while in service used intelligently? What would be the effect on the enlistment rate of the services if the threat of draft induction were completely removed from our young men? How can other factors which affect our overall national wellbeingsuch as education. family stability. career planning. and trainingbe weighed against the direct needs of the services? There are many. many such questions and we would do well to set about seeking answers to them. By increasing efficiency in the services. and by making them more attractive to voluntary enlistment. we have succeeded in greatly reducing the draft needs. I am not at all certain that the draft can be done away with in the foreseeable future. but I believe it is incumbent upon us to improve its operation. its standards and regulations so as to give maximum benefit to our national security. and to safeguard maximum freedom and opportunity to our young men. It is with this in mind that I urge this study be authorized as soon as possible.\n',want congratulate gentleman leadership initiate discussion propose time national manpower situation investigate study fact relate member recommend extension peacetime draft former officer more year duty command officer thousand draftee long continue interest military conscription outset grant conscription popular tolerate time emergency time peace cold war peace distasteful require military service young man recognize necessity such service continue threat communist_aggression believe determination remain strong prepared do prevent aggression hostility end come point suggest time whole concept draft review need make prejudgment study show enough recognize present system ideal good national interest thorough review worthwhile session plan week imagine hearten subject mind time hear statement weekend indicate realize need review manpower utilization problem look present draft system term national security many question arise system provide service skilled_technician require help hinder service keep skilled man morale motivation man draft volunteer pressure draft suffer significant degree present regulation allow need man escape service equitable way distribute burden service eliminate present feeling resentment cause seem favoritism short term service constant turnover personnel effect service strength efficiency most draftee bring service age high service prefer time man service use effect enlistment rate service threat draft induction remove young man other factor affect overall national wellbeingsuch education family stability career planning trainingbe weigh direct need service many many such question set seek answer increase efficiency service make attractive voluntary_enlistment succeed reduce draft need certain draft do foreseeable_future believe incumbent improve operation standard regulation give maximum benefit national security safeguard maximum freedom opportunity young man mind urge study authorize possible.\n,88.0,bound,1,0

I want to offer a few observations against the caucus rule and caucus control on legislative propositions. I believe that we have had illustrations here during this Congress that exemplify the proposition that in a legislative assembly such as this there should never be a caucus on any concrete proposition of legislation. From the very nature of our duties it Is. it seems to me. contrary to their conscientious fulfillment. We are elected as Members of the House of Representatives. The law provides for an open discussion. the Constitution provides even for a record vote when onefifth of the Members present shall demand It. It is intended that our work should be open and aboveboard before all our countrymen. But what Is the practice at the present time? We find the majority party meeting in caucus. taking up a bill that. if understood and intelligently considered. should tdfke a week and deciding upon that important measure in all its details at one sitting in one evening. The doors are closed. the curtains are drawn. the public is excluded. and everything is done in secret. Then these men take the measure that they have considered in this secret caucus. bring it before the country. and go through the silly formula of permitting men to offer amendments. and the Members who are pledged by that secret caucus vote down every proposition regardless of whether it appeals to them favorably or otherwise. Thus has the caucus been able to control the action of officials of the Government. An unofficial organization in secret controlling the official action of official men! I want to say to you. gentlemen. that this is wrong in principle and the American people will not stand for it indefinitely. When they realize and understand that their Representatives! hands are tied and their Representatives votes are controlled by a secret caucus. by unofficial action of that caucus. they will rise in their might and condemn any party that stands for it. You have said that you want to get rid of the czar. You have renounced the czar and sworn allegiance to a king. You have jumped out of the frying pan into the fire. Hold up your manacled. wounded. bleeding. shackled hands and let the cotintry see your parliamentary slavery ! Why do you not renounce your allegiance to king caucus and give your consciences an opportunity to act? We have in this House a membership of 391.

950199138,H,19771215,356,Mr. YOUNG of Florida,Unknown,YOUNG,Florida,M,24056,24226,12151977.txt,5945,426,95117310,YOUNG,C.,H,FL,M,R,6.0,voting,"Mr. Speaker. today we will vote on the conference report to accompanying H.R. 9346. the Social Security Financing Amendments of 1977. There are several provisions contained in the conference renort which would bring about changes in present law which I have actively sought to correct. As originally passed by the House. this legislation would have phased out the present limitations on outside earnings by 1982. Although the conferees did not agree to this language. they have agreed to increasing allowable earnings to: First. $4.000 in 1978. second. $4.500 in 1979. third. $5.000 in 1980. fourth. $5.500 in 1981. and fifth. $6.000 in 1982 with further increases determined by the state of inflation. The conferees have also agreed that in 1982 the age for those persons subject to the earnings limits will be reduced from 72 to 70. Although this action may not appear to be of great importance to some. for many persons living on a fixed income it will be of great assistance. This legislation will also prevent a reduction in benefits for widows or widowers aged 60 and over who remarry. Many of our senior citizens were hesitant to remarry after loosing their spouse because they were faced with a reduction or complete termination of their surviving spouse benefits. I am sure that you have all heard of cases where elderly people were faced with living their remaining years alone or ""living in sin"" as some call it. because they simply could not survive without the income they would lose by remarrying. We are all aware that the growing problem with the social security system is that as the average life scan increases and as benefits of retired workers continue to rise. outgo from the social security trust fund is exceeding income. According to the 1977 annual report of the social security systems Board of Trustees. the disability insurance fund will exhaust its backup reserves in 1979. and the retirement and survivors fund in 1983. unless Congress makes the necessary financial improvements. Because of this predicament. it is clear that Congress has to make some hard decisions as to the future direction of the social security system so that income to the trust fund will be adequate to meet benefits for recipients. In view of this. the Congress really has only two options. Either to provide additional income to the social security trust fund or allow the trust fund to be depleted and fail to meet the financial obligation to the millions of Americans now on social security as well as those who have been paying into the program but have not yet reached retirement age. Incidentally. in Pinellas County. Fla.. which is my home there are 230.000 people receiving social security benefits. and for many of them this check is their only source of income. As a consequence. this money is kept in circulation. Most of these senior citizens do not hoard their money or hide it away. They spend it. Pinellas Countys economy is strengthened by the $50 million in social security benefits received in our county each month. These social security checks are cashed and spent with local merchants for the purchase of those services and items necessary to meet ones daily needs. If the $50 million put into the Pinellas County economy every month. via the distribution of social security checks. were to all of a sudden stop because there were no longer any funds in the social security trust fund. the businessman and his employees would be severely affected. as well as those social security beneficiaries whose income would stop. The basic decision which we have to make is this. ""Is the social security program important enough to warrant imrosing additional taxes to keep it sound?"" I share the concern expressed by many over the fact that the Federal Government has placed the burden of bailing out the ailing social security trust fund on businesses and working people. but actually. who else is there? These are the very same people who have always paid for every governmentsponsored program in the past and who will continue to do so in the futureeven those programs which are excessive and wasteful. At least there is little fraud and abuse in the social security program when comoared with many other Government programs and the program benefits those with no other sources of income. We should never ignore the fact that those persons who are now receiving social security benefits were at one time the very same individuals who paid for the educational benefits enjoyed by the current work force and also contributed to the social security benefits of those who retired before they did. As for those of us now working and paying into the social security program. one day we will be the recipientrather than the financerof the program and it will be our children and grandchildren who will be supporting the program. There is no doubt that this. bill increases social security taxes. but early in 1978 it is planned to give the American workers and businesses a general tax reduction that will more than offset this .social security tax increase. There are several strong arguments I could use to justify a ""no"" vote on this conference report. When the original bill was before the House. I voted ""aye"" on final passage which establishes my support for strengthening the social security trust fund. However. the conference committee has agreed to several nongermane amendments and under the rule providing for consideration of this report we were denied any opportunity to reject those nongermane amendments. Some of these nongermane amendments relate to the welfare program and should not be attached to a social security bill. Social security is not a welfare program and I object to making a social security bill a hostage vehicle for welfare legislation. However. since the bill will have no effect for more than a year. that is sufficient time to attempt to correct those problems and I intend to support this bill.\n'",today vote conference report accompany several provision contain conference_renort bring change present law seek correct pass legislation phase present limitation outside earning conferee agree language agree increase allowable earning third fourth_fifth further increase determine state inflation conferee agree age person subject earning limit reduce action appear great importance many person live fix income great assistance legislation prevent reduction benefit widow_widower age remarry many senior citizen hesitant remarry loose spouse face reduction complete termination surviving_spouse benefit sure hear case elderly people face live remain year live sin call survive income lose remarry aware grow problem social_security system average life scan increase benefit retire worker continue rise outgo social_security trust fund exceed income accord annual report social_security system disability insurance fund exhaust backup reserve retirement survivor fund make necessary financial improvement predicament clear make hard decision future direction social_security system income trust fund adequate meet benefit recipient view option provide additional income social_security trust fund allow trust fund deplete fail meet financial obligation million social_security pay program reach retirement age home people receive social_security benefit many check only source income consequence money keep circulation most senior citizen hoard money hide spend economy strengthen social_security benefit receive county month social_security check cash spend local merchant purchase service item necessary meet one daily need put economy month distribution social_security check sudden stop fund social_security trust fund businessman employee affect social_security beneficiary income stop basic decision make social_security program important warrant imrose additional taxis keep sound share concern express many fact place burden bail ail social_security trust fund business work people same people pay governmentsponsore program past continue futureeven program excessive wasteful least little fraud_abuse social_security program comoare many other government program program benefit other source income ignore fact person receive social_security benefit time same individual pay educational benefit enjoy current work force contribute social_security benefit retire work pay social_security program day recipientrather financerof program child_grandchild support program doubt bill increase social_security taxis plan give american worker business general tax reduction offset .social_security tax increase several strong argument use justify vote conference report original bill vote aye final_passage establish support strengthen social_security trust fund conference committee agree several nongermane amendment rule provide consideration report deny opportunity reject nongermane amendment nongermane amendment relate welfare program attach social_security bill social_security welfare program object make social_security bill hostage vehicle welfare legislation bill effect more year sufficient time attempt correct problem intend support bill.\n,95.0,bound,1,0

Mr. Speaker. as other speakers have already noted. this year marks the 100th anniversary of the first flying of the American flag over the island of Guam. Over the past 100 years. a lot of things have changed. but Guams loyalty to the United States has remained steadfast. To the best of my knowledge. Guam remains the only populated U.S. territory to have been captured and occupied by enemy forces during World War II. Despite the repressive tactics of the Japanese during their threeyear occupation of the Island of Guam. the people of Guam remained loyal to the United States. and lost many lives and suffered inhumane treatment simply because they retained this strong loyalty. The citizens of Guam have in the past and continue to support our military services with high enlistment rates and the loss of local land given up for military based in support of their island and the rest of our nation. Even today. Guam hosts significant naval and air force bases which frequently are the staging point for national military operations in the Pacific. As foreign countries have dictated the removal of our operational stations in the western Pa. cific. Guams location in the central Pacific has increased in importance. and today is considered to be of strategic importance. Despite the support of the U.S. citizens in Guam of the United States over the past century. their desire for increased autonomy has met with resistance in Washington. D.C. I wish to commend Congressman UNDERWOOD for his efforts to fight for increased automy for the people of Guam and for his efforts to move this legislation to the floor today. I also want to recognize Congressman DON YOUNG. Chairman of the Committee on Resources. and Congressman GEORGE MILLER.

Mr. President. the main objection I had to this amendment was. as has been stated by the Senator from California. that it singled out the President of the United States and said to him in plain words. ""We believe that the salary as fixed by law for your office is too great. but as we cannot repeal it until the close of the present term. we will enact that after 1877 the salary of the President of the United States shall be $25.000. and you shall be hung up for three years and challenged to take the salary now providedby law. or to take simply $25.000 according to the salary as it was hefore. and as it will be after your term expires."" It was placing the President in a most embarrassing position. it was. in my judgment. an insultto the President. Although not so intended. I have no doubt but the effect of it was to humiliate him and put him in a position where he would be most embarrassed. and for that reason I voted against that amendment. Now. sir. this morning we have another amendment proposed looking in the same direction as the one offered by the Senator from Iudiana. only going farther and providing that the employ6s of the Senate and House of Representatives shall also pay back out of their salary what they have received additional since the 4th of March last. That amendment was voted down. as was the other offered by the Senator from Indiana. Now. sir. the bill stands before the Senate with the amendment offered by the Senator from Maryland. and I am not disposed to join with those who criticise the chairman of the committee for voting for that amendment. because I think he was attached to it. It was only a choice with him between firstborn and the secondborn. and he chose the first. That is human nature. and we should not question too closely his motives in this matter. but I will join with those who say that he made a mistake. I think so.

The Dreyfus anproachas the Journal accurately describes itis to cut taxes first and then force the budget to fit what is left. Mr. President. there are loud groans of pain in my State as this agonizing process of shrinking State government goes on. It may or may not sacceed in Wisconsin. But it does. as the Wall Street Journal points out. indeed offer a neat and timely case history in whatgiven the willwe could accomplish in Washington. Of course. the Wall Street Journal does overlook a critical differene. It is this: Once the State cuts taxes. as the Democratic Wisconsin Legislature has done. the die is cast. Revenues shrink and spending must be cut because our State constitution prohibits a State debt. The only grim alternative available to Governor and legislature is to increase taxes and. politically. that is a very fat political no no these days. But here Democratic and Republican administrations have been getting around that little obstacle like German panzers racing around the maginot line. We cut taxesand we could do it againenact KempRoth all the way. And we still would not cut spending. because we can and will do just what we have been doing for 19 of the last 20 yearsrun a bigger. fatter deficit than ever. If Reagan is going to follow Dreyfus. if Washington is to take a pointer from Wisconsin. then we must find a way. a sure and certain way. to balance the budget. Then and only then will the Wisconsin experience have any real relevance. The formula for fiscal sanity and the basis of a genuine antiinflation policy is clear. Yes. cut taxes. Yes. index the tax system so revenues do not automatically increase with inflation. Follow this Wisconsin State government lead. But in addition. balance the budget. I hope and pray that balancing the budget will not take the rigidity of a constitutional amendment. But. Mr. President. in both 1979 and again this year. this body rejected Proxmire amendments that would have balanced the budget by simply cutting revenues to meet expenditures and the votes were overwhelming. So I am. with great reluctance. wavering in my opposition to riveting into the Constitution a requirement that we balance the budget. except in periods of such serious emergency that twothirds ox each House of Congress votes for a deficit. One more serious caveat: This situation. reducing State and local taxes and matching State budgets to lower expenditure levels. bears with it a hidden danger. There is an overwhelming temptation to substitute Federal dollars for the displaced State dollars. TIhe cry for Federal revenue sharing will increase in proportion to the reduction in State revenues and my Wisconsin State government friends are right in the middle of this cry. Countercyclical revenue sharing. State revenue sharing. general revenue sharing. phony disaster assistanceall of these easymoney solutions will be eyed with increasing attention by State elected leaders as a financial solution to their lower revenue ceilings. As this substituton occurs. and it increases every day. then the entire purpose of State budget balancing is lost. Uncle Sugar becomes the fall guy and a balanced budget at the Federal level is even more unlikely. So. let us keep a full and wary eye on Mayors and Governors to see if they balance their budgets by looking to Washington for a financial bailout after the tough State and local decisions have been made. At any rate. our Republican Wisconsin Governor. Lee Dreyfus. and our Democratic Wisconsin Legislature deserve kudos for giving us a very helpful start in the right direction. Mr. President.

This has not always been the case. In 1945 there were less than 200.000 registered motorcycles and the ranks of American motorcycle manufacturers could claim only two from a field with a one tinie high of over 200. Owner enthusiasm has been the one trait that has made the industry and sport so popular. Ask any motorcyclist why motorcycling is so popular and the one thread that runs through all replies will be the exhilerating sense of freedom that motorcycling gives the rider. The desire to capture that sense of freedom Is evident with the first signs of spring. Motorcyclists are fond of saying they have a desire to ""get in the wind."" As the days get warmer Im sure that many of us have looked with envy at a passing motorcyclists and thought ""it would sure be nice to trade places with him."" As easy as it looks. riding a motorcycle is more than just getting on and heading down the road. The desire to rideregardless of how much fun It appears to beis often coupled with apprehension. As motorists we simply get in our vehicle and because we were trained as children to ""watch for cars"" that is exactly what we do. The apprehension a motorcyclist feels stems from the knowledge every motorcyclist rides withmotorcycles are often overlooked by other motorists. In fact. the first words an errant driver usually utters after colliding with a motorcycle are. ""but officer. I didnt see the motorcycle."" A well documented statistic shows that in over 65 percent of the motorcycle/other vehicle accidents. the responsibility of the accident can be attributed to the driver of the other vehicle. Those statistics are seldom if ever comforting to the motorcyclists or the errant driver. Motorcycle enthusiast groups have long realized that safety equipment alone is not enough to decrease the number of motorcyclists injured or killed. These groups have lobbied State legislatures for programs to train the riders to pass stricter licensing requirements and educate the driver to be more aware of motorcycles and to share the roadway. In Nevada the Motorcycle Dealers Association and the Modified Motorcycle Association of Nevada donated to every high school in the State the motorcycle safety foundation film. ""A Drivers View of Motorcycling."" Since 1983 these two organizations have been successful in obtaining a proclamation from Gov. Richard Bryan declaring May. ""Motorcycle Safety and Awareness Month."" Enthusiast groups throughout the United States have duplicated the efforts witnessed in Nevada. In State after State it has been the motorcyclist who has led the efforts to strengthen licensing requirements. educate the nonmotorcycling public about sharing the roadway. and implement motorcycle training programs. To my knowledge. this is the first request to have May proclaimed ""National Motorcycle Safety and Awareness Month."" Again It is the motorcyclists who have brought this request to me. This request is part of a national effort. Motorcyclists. through their State organizations. will be using this proclamation to promote a series of local.

Casimir Pulaski. Pulaski is often referred to as ""Count Pulaski"" in historical works. He was born in Podolia. Poland. at a time when that nation was undergoing a severe internal political battle. With rapacious neighbors beginning to conspire against the freedom of his people. the boy Pulaski was consumed with an early desire to ward off danger. and evinced a keen interest in military affairs at a very young age. Long before he reached his majority Pulaski joined in the guard of Duke Charles. and thus gained a rigorous and practical experience in the art of warfare. In 1769 he joined his father. Joseph Pulaski. in what was termed ""The Confederation of Bar."" this confederation being a conjointure of Polish noblemen. each one of whom pledged his time. his fortune. and his life to the salvation of Poland. Casimir Pulaski and his brother. Francis. became the active leaders in the movement. The older leaders were soon dispersed. some going abroad. others were confined in dungeons. Pulaskis father was one of those confined in a dungeon prison. where he later died. But despite this Casimir carried on. and at the head of a small force of cavalry he performed heroic feats. With his brother he became a constant terror to the Russians. who were trying to capture him. Against overwhelming odds for 4 years this great patriotic organization under this great leader fought to oust the enemies of Poland from his country. But all their -efforts proved fruitless. During this time one of General Pulaskis brothers was killed before his eyes. the youngest brother taken into captivity. and many of his countrymen were doomed to misery. Gen. Casimir Pulaski was the leading spirit of his countrymen In this unequal struggle to preserve the country intact. Although but 25 years of age. he was the acknowledged leader and the hero of his countrymen. Heedless of his foe. which was much more powerful. he fought with a zeal and tenacity that made him renowned as a cavalry leader throughout the Continent of Europe. General Pulaski not only lost his father and brother in this glorious attempt to save Poland from the first of her ignoble partitions. but his estates were confiscated and he was proscribed by King Stanislaus and had to travel to Turkey. Soon thereafter. in 1772. Count Casimir Pulaski issued his memorable manifesto. In which he said in part: I am not astonished that the enemies of my country resolved on her ruin. should direct their shares against those who most firmly resist their impetuosity. and that they should regard as such the brave Poles whom they have sacrificed and who are still repelling their most cruel attacks. * * * My destiny was clear. when at the age of 21. far from yielding to the amusements of youth. I regarded every moment as lost which was not employed in repelling the enemies of my country. * * * I have endeavored to mark my course by an invincible fortitude. Neither the blood of one of my brothers. which was shed by the enemy before my eyes. nor the cruel servitude of another. nor the sad fate of so many of my relations and compatriots has shaken my patriotism. Perhaps no better insight Into the sturdy character of Pulaski. who is revered both in Europe and America. could be given than the above excerpt from his manifesto. He traveled to Turkey. but. repelled with the feeble notions of liberty entertained by the Sultan. he journeyed on to Marseilles. France. and from there to Paris. It was in the French capital that he made the acquaintance of Benjamin Franklin and young Americas struggle for independence. Benjamin Franklin. writing from Paris to General Washington on May 29. 1777. said: Count Pulaski. of Poland. an officer famous throughout Europe for his bravery and conduct in defense of the liberties of his country against the three great invading powers of Russia. Austria. and Prussia. will have the honor of delivering this into Your Excellencys hands. General Pulaski landed in America the middle of July 1777.- and. after presenting his letters to Washington and Congress. waited for Congress to take action. In the meantime. Washingtons army passed through the streets of Philadelphia. Spurred by the sight of marching soldiers. Pulaski. restless and eager to aid our cause. decided not to waib for his commission. but to follow the army as a volunteer. In Europe a member of the nobility. an officer of distinguished prestige. in America a private in the ranks. Such was Pulaski. Not self. but service. was his lifes motto. The night of September 8. 1777. Washigton assembled a council of war to decide which position the army should take in defense of Philadelphia. The upland. across the brook of Brandywine. was chosen. The army moved to this position atdawn. The enemys attack was expected on the llth and about 9. oclock of that day the red uniforms appeared. The battle started. The vanguard. under General Maxwell. retreated under heavy pressure. The rest of the army was stretched out lengthwise for a considerable distance along the brook. The right wing was under the command of General Sullivan. and the left wing. to the south. was under the command of General Armstrong. General Wayne and General Proctor commanded the cannon and the artillery. Washington remained with the reserve. which was commanded by General Greene. and Pulaski was stationed by the side of Washington. Upon the withdrawal of General Maxwell the British kept up fire. but did not attempt crossing the creek. Washington was about ready to strike a blow at the enemy. but first wanted to be convinced that the opponents main forces were not circumventing him for an attack at the rear. To that end. a detachment was sent out to explore the region. About 2 oclock an orderly dispatched the news that the enemy could not be seen on any of the roads on the opposite side of the creek. An order of attack was about to be issued when a man in a cart was noticed waving his hat and striving to reach headquarters. The man turned out to be Squire Cheney. with the startling news that the main forces of the enemy had crossed the Brandywine to the north and were fast approaching the armys rear. . Washington immediately directed the division of Sullivan. together with the brigades of Conway. Stirling. and Stephans to meet the enemy. They hurriedly arrayed themselves for battle. just as the British were spied on the road. Thereupon the British vanguard showed itself. on the plain. The American artillery opened fire. Hessian riflemen were playing havoc with the American front ranks. At the same time a column of infantry rushed to the upland occupied by the Americans. The center was holding up under the bombardment but both wings were fleeing. The enemy then concentrated on the- center which soon wavered. Chaos reigned. At this juncture Pulaski secured Washingtons permission to use his bodyguard. some 30 horse. and launched a furious attack at the pursuers. With great skill he wedged into the side of the pursuing column. Swinging their sabers from left to right. this small detachment brought confusion to the ranks of the enemy. The pursuit was momentarily checked. Pulaskis forces took shelter with General Greenes army and together they held the enemy while the rear of the American Army retreated to Dillworth. There the road narrowed and the Americans gained a vantage point where they could withstand the onslaught of the enemy. Thus Washingtons army was saved. Within 2 months after his arrival. on September 15. 1777. Congress elected Pulaski ""commander of the horse. with the rank of brigadier."" General Washingtons letter to Congress recommending the appointment of Pulaski read as follows: This gentleman has been. like us. engaged in defending the liberty and independence of his country and has sacrificed his fortune and his zeal for these objects. He derives from hence a title to our respect that ought to operate in his favor as far as the good of the service will permit. Shortly afterward. Washingtons army was saved from an almost inevitable destruction at Warren Tavern. near Philadelphia. only by the war craft of Pulaski. He also engaged in the Battle of Germantown. On the day of the Battle of Germantown he was sorely disappointed and mortified. There were but four regiments of cavalry raised and not one of them completed. Three of them only. such as they were. had joined General Washingtons army. and on the day of the battle. guards were furnished out of those regiments to attend on the commander in chief and on other generals. This was a matter of deep regret and bitter chagrin. . When General Washington had taken his winter quarters at Valley Forge. the cavalry were sent over into New Jersey on account of forage and for other service .on that side of the Delaware. Pulaski made his headquarters in Trenton. Weary of the lapse in activity subsequent to these previous battles and dampened by the pettiness of the commander under whom he was stationed. as well as the tardy tactics of Congress in carrying out his suggestions for the improvement of the Infantry. Pulaski .expressed a wish to return to Europe. Washington persuaded him to remain. however. In March 1778 he asked permission from General Washington and Congress to organize an independent corps. later to be known throughout the Colonies as the ""Polish Legion."" In equipping it he is said to have spent $50.000 of his own funds. These horsemen. among other arms. bore the famous Polish lances. a new weapon on this continent. Rated as the most expert horseman in the American Cavalry. his service in leading and inspiring the Cavalry was of inestimable value. From the time Pulaski took command it became a notable weapon of offense and defense. It is entirely possible that without it the cause of independence would"" not have been won. Then followed the battle of Charleston. S. C.. when the city was sieged by 900 British troops from General Prevosts army. Although not altogether successful in his assault. Pulaski held the city 2 days until the arrival of reinforcements. Probably Pulaskis most distinguished service was rendered in the siege of Savannah. Ga.. although this move was made contrary to the sound advice of Pulaski. who pleaded a delay of a number of days due to their unpreparedness. Pulaski was here made commander of the entire cavalry. both French and American. During the battle their scheme failed. The French became entangled and their Admiral DEstaing was wounded. Chaos resulted in the ranks. Hoping to rally the men and regain order. Pulaski rushed into the thick of the battle. Leading his men in a desperate charge. he received a wound in his right thigh and was carried from the field of battle fatally wounded. Pulaski died 2 days later while on board the brig Wasp. leaving Savannah Harbor on the way to Charleston. According to his friend and companion in arms. Capt. Paul Bentalou. he was buried at sea. and funeral services were held afterward in the city of Charleston. In this manner. at the age of 31 years. ended the life of one of the most active and greatest patriots of his time. A man well born. of handsome* physique and liberal education. who abandoned a life of ease and complacency for a career of unnumbered. hardships and much bitterness. His was a proud and magnanimous personality. but he had to contend with petty men and the crudeness of a nation in its genesis. His corps of lancers and light infantry. which were recruited mostly in Baltimore. has since become famous under the name of Pulaskis Legion. He is known as the founder of the American Cavalry. Pulaski. like Washington. could have.chosen the easy course. They were both men of large means. But they recognized the responsibility of wealth and rank. An equestrian statue. which stands between Thirteenth and Fourteenth Streets on Pennsylvania Avenue. Washington. commemorates this hero of two hemispheres. The splendid funeral honors paid by the citizens of Charleston to the memory of the brave Pulaskithe united regrets of the people and of the Army at the loss of an officer no less beloved than he was usefuland the last tribute of respect offered to his memory by Congress have already evinced the sensibilities and gratitude of our Nation. The gallant son of Poland had enthusiastically espoused the cause of America. He served that cause with zeal. ardor. and fidelity. Pulaski died as he had liveda hero. but an enemy of kings. Since the time of Pulaski others have come from his native land to mix their blood with the blood of other peoples to make one common country and to build a single destiny. Many Americans of Polish extraction have offered their lives in defense of this country on many battlefieldsin the Civil War. the SpanishAmerican War. and in the great World Wars. The blood of Pulaski still flows in the blood of his countrymen. To the memory of Pulaski. William K. Palmer dedicated these beautiful words: Columbiai He died for thee Cheerfully. and for liberty Honored forever more On this Atlantic shore Since the American Revolution. many Poles immigrated to the United States. They haite given their lives and contributed their sinews and toil for the freedom and development of this great cbuntry. They have become an integral part of America. they fought as soldiers of the United States on all battle fronts. as workers in the factories and in essential industries. and as farmers. miners. and lumberjacks. They shared the task if. th. war production. and as full citizens they hold all kinds of positions in the civic. social. political. cultural life in America. These American citizens of Polish extraction understand the plight of the Polish people. they resent Russian interference in Polish politics. they resent Russian domination or dictatorship over the Polish Nation and the Polish people. Polands record as a fighting member of the Allied Nations during the war is unassailable. Poland was the first to take up the fight with whatever weapons were available against the GermanNazi aggression for world domination. During the whole war she fought bravely and actively. and did not shrink from any sacrifice. Poland will not voluntarily give up her independence. freedom. and liberty. Poland fought at a time when other powers were conciliating and making overtures to Hitler. Yes. Poland experienced more misery and devastation in human lives and material wealth than any other European nation. She lived through a literal inferno of Nazi occupation. To indicate the immensity of the problem facing the Polish people at the time of liberation from the Nazis. here are some figures on Polands wartime losses: 6.104.990 Polish citizens killed. 10.000 factories and industrial plants destroyed. 300.000 buildings. hundreds of thousands of homes. and 400.000 farms totally or partly left in ruins. 100 percent of the machinetool industry wiped out. 6.399 damaged schools. 15.900.000 books destroyed. approximately 6.500.000 children in need of medical care. homes. and food. But. in face of these seemingly unsurmountable problems. the Polish people willingly turned to the enormous task of rebuilding their destroyed cities. renovating their factories. resowing their farmlands. reestablishing their transportation and communication lines. and countless other tasks. The accomplishments of the Polish people are nothing short of remarkable. Emerging from the dark chaos of war. the Polish people. through their undying love for their motherland. have instilled new life in their warravaged country. The reconstruction of their ruined capital. Warsaw. is symbolic of the Polish peoples achievements. The Germans had wantonly destroyed this once glorious city. burning its buildings and killing off the populace. Rising from the burning embers the few remaining Poles proceeded with the work of resurrecting Warsaw. A Supreme Council of Reconstruction. comprised of representatives of social. artistic. technical. and professional groups.- was formed. Its task was to mobilize all the spiritual and material resources of the nation for the work of rebuilding the city. During the past 2 years great strides have been made in rebuilding Warsaw. Electric plants have been rebuilt. the water system has been repaired. radio station reconstructed. surface transportation has been restored. and many other improvements have been instituted. Warsaw is unlike other ruined cities of Europe. There is a spirit that transcends the sorrow and destruction. On the top of a heap of rubble. where a beautiful edifice once stood. there is now a flower shop. Farther down the street. on tops of similar heaps of crumbled stone. one will find a clothing store. a book mart. or other temporary shops. All over the city people are rebuilding and renovating. The Polish people do not believe in waiting for machinery. equipment. and so forth. they are rebuilding with their hearts and hands. Warsaw will live again. because the people believe in the inherent value of reconstruction. because the people love her dearly. and because the people are enthusiastic about the future of Poland and are willing to sacrifice to achieve a better life. But. the spirit in Warsaw is not unlike the feeling of all Poland. People are working. learning. creating. They have faith and courage in what they are doing. They will succeed. One of Polands greatest achievements to date has been the reconstruction of its transportation and conmunication system. Before the war Poland had a wellorganized railroad system. Tuke Germans did their best during the occupation to change that. They confiscated railroad cars. locomotives. and engines. They destroyed about 30 percent of Polands railway tracks10.000 miles. 42 percent of her engines. 92 percent of her passenger cars. and 92 percent of her freight cars. At the end of the war Poland was left with 30 locomotives. 100 passenger cars. and 2.000 freight cars. These. without exception. were antiquated German cars. minus windows and doors. and locomotives which could not travel 100 miles without stopping for repairs. Such was the legacy of German destruction which the Poles took over in the spring of 1945. Perhaps the most striking example of the rapidity with which Poland is rebuilding her industries is her coal production. The losses sustained by the Polish coal mines during the war are estimated to be as high as $700.000.000. Despite this. the Polish people at the beginning of 1946 undertook the gigantic job of rebuilding their coalproducing industry. So successful have they been that today Poland stands out as the No. 1 supplier of coal in Europe. Her total production for 1947 was 60.000.000 tons. of which 27.000.000 tons were exported. as against 45.000.000 tons produced in 1946. of which 13.487.934 tons were exported. These figures have tremendous signifir cance for the economic recovery of the continent. Europes most urgent need today is coal. Poland. with its mounting coal production. is becoming the one shining light in an otherwise bleak coal picture in Europe. One reason offered by many people for the increased coal production in Poland as compared to other countries is the high productivity and enthusiasm of the Polish minerthis. despite the fact that the Polish worker receives fewer calories than the German worker. Polands coal production would increase many more times if she could receive more modern mining equipment. Patriotic Americans of Polish extraction request that the Polish nation and the Polish people receive a square deal. They cannot understand why billions of dollars are being appropriated as outright -gifts to nations and people who have been our enemies. and the Polish nation and the Polish people. who have always been on our side In every struggle. are being ignored and discriminated against. They request specifically that the Polish nation and the Polish people receive loans and credits on a business basis. and some relief aid for the needy and destitute. We must not drop -the iron curtain on th6 Polish people who have always been our loyal friends.- We should not shunt them aside and deny them even com-. mercial loans that they desperately need. in their struggle for reconstruction. Poland today has trade agreements with practically every nation in Europe. To make factories run. you must have energy. Europes source of energy -is coal. The two greatest suppliers of coal for Europe are the United States of America and Poland. The Ruhr should be No. 1 source of supply. But Ruhr coal Is being hoarded for Germany. Only about 5.000.000 tons of this coal was made available for other nations. Seventyfive percent of Polish export coal went to western European nations. such as Austria. eastern Germany. Italy. France. Sweden. Norway. Denmark. Belgium. Holland. England. Czechoslovakia. Polands request for $60.000.000 to modernize her coalmining equipment has not been acted upon. Why? Are they just interested in rebuilding Germany?\n'",today birthday refer historical work bear time nation undergo severe internal political battle rapacious_neighbor begin conspire freedom people boy

I introduced S. 2959. the Emergency Labor Disputes Act of 1971. Unlike some other proposals which have been made to curb national emergency strikes. my approach was not limited solely to the transportation industry. While I would support such legislation. I believe that those who would limit this legislation to transportation disputes are only tackling part of the problem. If the advocates of such narrow legislation woula only look to the current coal strike in Great Britain. they will be able to see how an entire nation is being crippled by a nontransportation strike. On February 14. the New York Times reported that the British Government has ordered 20.000 large- and mediumsize companies to cut back to a 3day week and slash power consumption by 50 percent. Official predictions are that by midweek the number of men laid off as a result of the British coal strike will run between 5 and 8 million. The situation in Great Britain is deteriorating. and it is predicted that up to 20 million workers will have to be laid off very shortly. This type of calamity can occur in this country just as easily as it can occur in Great Britain. In fact. since the coal industry is nationalized in Great Britain. it would appear that such a crisis could occur even more readily in this country. Rather than lock the barn door after the horse is gone. I think that we should recognize that legislation is needed now to give the Secretary of Labor additional tools with which to deal with these crippling strikes. There is nothing in this legislation that would require the Secretary of Labor to act if he did not wish to do so. but it would be foolhardy. in my judgment. not to have these tools available if this country is to avert the kind of economic crisis which has now overtaken Great Britain. I ask unanimous consent that the article to which I have referred entitled. ""Britons Warned on Power Crisis."" published in the New York Times of February 14. be printed in the RECORD.

When it is made into clothing which hangs in the store it looks all right. but when the purchaser wears it a short time he finds that there is a vast difference between it and real wool. The passage of this bill will protect the highclass manufacturer of woolen clothes. it will protect the manufacturer who produces real woolen clothes against the man who buys up old junk and then chops it up and converts it into cloth. The use of such cloth is not a good thing from a health standpoint and it is not desirable from any other standpoint. I agree when the Senator says that this bill will affect all the consumers of the United States. If they want shoddy. if they want choppedup wool. very well. but the purchaser ought to know what he is buying and whether he is buying shoddy or real wool. If a man desires to purchase a garment made of virgin wool he ought to know that he is getting cloth made from virgin wool. There is a vast difference. as everyone is aware who knows anything about the manufacture of woolen goodsand I know something about it. for I happened to live in a community at one time. in my early life. where woolen goods were manufacturedbetween shoddy or choppedup wool and virgin wool.\n'",take case camel_hair label wool buy camelshair coat know difference real wool camel_hair bill seek protect consumer present time buy suit_clothe sell wool make material old suit_clothe old rag junk chop reprocess sell wool person buy realize buy choppedup_wool mark wool tell difference choppedup_wool shoddyand isand real wool make suit come wear see sample show difference real wool_choppedup wool_choppedup wool wear pick piece finger short period use make clothing hang store look right purchaser wear short time find vast difference real wool passage bill protect highclass manufacturer woolen_clothe protect manufacturer produce real woolen_clothe man buy old junk chop convert cloth use such cloth good thing health standpoint desirable other standpoint agree say bill affect consumer want shoddy want choppedup_wool purchaser know buy buy shoddy real wool man desire purchase garment make virgin_wool know get cloth make wool vast difference aware know manufacture goodsand know happen live community time early life woolen good manufacturedbetween shoddy_choppedup wool,76.0,bound,0,1

I discuss a rare strain of HIV that is highly resistant to most antiretroviral drugs and causes a rapid onset of AIDS that was recently discovered in a patient in New York City. The strain. identified as 3DCR HIV. is resistant to 3 of the 4 classes of antiretroviral drugs. which means that 19 of the 20 available antiretroviral drug combinations would be ineffective for a person with this HIV strain. Although drugresistant HIV strains are common in patients who have been treated with antiretroviral drugs. multipledrugresistant HIV is extremely rare in patients who are newly diagnosed and previously untreated. Moreover. while HIV infection usually takes about 10 years to progress to AIDS. this patient apparently progressed to AIDS in a matter of months. Combination of a highly drug resistant HIV infection and rapid disease progression has the potential to become a very serious public health problem with global health implications. The ultimate significance of the new strain is still unknown. Only time will tell whether this was an isolated case or part of an outbreak of similar cases. It is imperative. however. that we take action to identify and halt the spread of aggressive. multiresistant HIV/AIDS strains. We must continue to build upon and fund existing prevention programs and to strengthen our infectious disease monitoring systems. The CDC. in collaboration with community. state. national. governmental and nongovernmental partners. employs a number of programs designed to prevent HIV infection and reduce the incidence of HIVrelated illness and death. By providing financial and technical support for disease surveillance. riskreduction counseling. street and community outreach. schoolbased education on AIDS. prevention case management. and prevention and treatment of other sexually transmitted diseases that can increase risks for HIV transmission. such programs have played a key role in reducing HIV transmission. Stopping the spread of this strain is also critical in order to preserve the effectiveness of existing HIV/AIDS therapies. Not only do such therapies prolong and improve the quality of life of those affected by HIV/AIDS. but they also play a vital role in preventing the spread of the disease. A recent study found that HIV therapies reduce infectiousness by 60 percent. Consequently. that is why I recently reintroduced... 311. the Early Treatment for HIV Act. ETHA. Supported by a bipartisan group of 31 Senators. ETHA redresses a fundamental flaw under the current Medicaid system that provides access to care only after individuals have developed full blown AIDS. ETHA brings Medicaid eligibility rules in line with Federal Government guidelines on the standard of care for treating HIV. ETHA helps address the fact that increasingly. in many parts of the country. there are growing waiting lists for access to lifesaving medications and limited access to comprehensive health care. Access to HIV therapies reduces the amount of HIV virus present in a persons bloodstream. viral load. a key factor in curbing infectiousness and reducing the ability to transmit HIV. Early access to HIV therapies as provided under ETHA would not only delay disease progression and increase life expectancy. but it would also reduce the need for more expensive treatment and costly hospital stays. According to a study conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers. ETHA would reduce gross Medicaid costs by 70 percent. saving the Federal Government approximately $1.5 billion over 10 years. With the administration looking for ways to reduce Medicaid costs. passing ETHA would be a good start. Its also the right thing to do.""\n'",discuss rare strain_resistant most antiretroviral_drug cause rapid onset discover patient strain identify 3dcr resistant class antiretroviral_drug mean available antiretroviral_drug combination ineffective person strain_drugresistant strain common patient treat antiretroviral_drug multipledrugresistant rare patient diagnose untreated_infection take year progress patient progress matter month combination drug resistant_infection rapid disease progression potential become serious public health problem global health implication ultimate significance new strain unknown only time tell isolated case part outbreak similar case imperative take action identify halt spread aggressive multiresistant strain continue build fund exist prevention program strengthen infectious_disease monitoring system collaboration community state national governmental_nongovernmental partner employ number program design prevent infection reduce incidence hivrelate_illness death provide financial technical support disease surveillance riskreduction counseling street community outreach schoolbase education prevention case management prevention treatment other transmit disease increase risk transmission such program play key role reduce transmission stop spread strain critical order preserve effectiveness exist therapy such therapy prolong improve quality life affect play vital role prevent spread disease recent study find therapy reduce infectiousness percent reintroduce support bipartisan group senator redress fundamental_flaw current system provide access care individual develop full_blown bring eligibility rule line guideline standard care treat help address fact many part country grow waiting_list access_lifesave medication limited access comprehensive health_care access therapy reduce amount virus present person bloodstream viral load key factor curb_infectiousness reduce ability transmit early access therapy provide delay disease progression increase life_expectancy reduce need expensive treatment costly hospital stay accord study conduct reduce gross cost percent save year administration look way reduce cost pass good start right thing,109.0,daily,1,0

I yield myself 5 minutes. Mr. Chairman. this bill really for the first time enacts into law the fundamental and unAmerican principle of blaming the victim. That is what this bill is all about. We essentially have seen over the course of the last several years. politician after politician walk before every housing monstrosity in the United States. point to public housing. time and time againi. and say. ""This is an example of liberal Democratic politics at its worst. This is an eyesore. an acute demonstration of why the Johnson era of liberal Democratic spending on Government programs simply has been outmoded."" The truth of the matter is that public housing policy in this country is the greatest unfulfilled dream that has ever been encompassed by this body. What we have said is that we are going to house poor people. But then we never gave the housing authorities anything close to the resources that were necessary to provide the housing they were asked to give to the people that are of such low income. Then what we do is. after we starve those public housing authorities and the individual public housing projects. we come along. take a picture of. ourselves in front of them. and say. ""This is a terrible example of Government spending."" What do we do? What is our solution to this problem? It is to cut the funding. Last year without a single hearing we cut. in order to solve the problem of public housing. 25 percent of the budget of public housing. Now what we are doing in this bill is coming back and saying. ""Look. public housing does not work. so what we are going to do is essentially allow and enact into law provisions which allow us to jack up the rents on the people that exist in public housing. thereby throwing a lot of poor people out of public housing. and. I might add. working families out of public housing."" This bill. more than anything else. hurts working families. the working poor. People that earn the minimum wage are going to be displaced by the actions taken in this bill. What we are saying is that when you are in public housing. we are going to knock you out. if you are in assisted housing. we are going to knock you out. if you are elderly or disabled. you are at risk. Those are the provisions that are hidden in the sneaky language that we are not going to hear by the other side of the aisle. What is important for us to recognize. Mr. Chairman. is yes. there need to be changes in how we handle public housing. I think Secretary Cisneros and President Clinton deserve credit. as I want to provide credit to Chairman LAZIO. for the portions of this bill that allow us to cut out badly run public housing authorities. to cut out badly run public housing agencies. to get rid of the oneforone public housing criteria that was included in past bills. to deal with the Federal preferences which have gotten us far too concentrated on serving just the very. very poor. Maintaining the drug elimination grants. maintaining the Hope 6 program. these are all the positive aspects which I think Chairman LAZIO should be proud of and that I am proud to associate myself with. But the trouble is that the bill goes too far. We end up eliminating the Brooke amendment. which has been the most fundamental protection for poor people in this country. We say as a protection to the poor that we will not ask them to pay anything more than 30 percent of their income in rent. Thirty percent of their income in rent is a lot of money for ordinary families. So by eliminating that. certainly it protects the housing authorities because they can jack up the rent. So the poor people in the housing authorities have no place to go. so we send them out on the street. Then what do we do? We turn around and say that we are going to cut the homeless programs in this country by another 25 percent. So not only do we go about actually creating homelessness in this program. we then go and cut the very program that is supposed to take care of them. The people that we do not hear from in this bill are the people that are going to be displaced by this bill. We have two amendments that we need. that if we can see this body pass them today. I will recommend that we vote in support of this bill. First and foremost is BARNEY FRANKs amendment to protect the Brooke amendment. If we protect the Brooke amendment and do that with the necessary targeting. so that we do not just throw out the poor and that we do not throw out the working families. the working poor of this country. then I tell Chairman LAZIO right now that I would recommerid that the Democrats of this House of Representatives support the bill. Without those fundamental protections. this is essentially flawed and bad legislation. It will hurt working families. It will hurt the poor. It will hurt senior citizens. and it will hurt the disabled. Let us stand up for principle in this body. Let us stand up for what is right in terms of not only public housing policy but the moral fiber and the moral value that is associated with the United States of America. Mr. Chairman.

We remember that President Johnson proudly asserted ""one man. one vote"" as the principle to be followed by the rulers of the Saigon government. which we were and still are supporting with our Armed Forces. In that election. Truong Dinh Dzu. the peace candidate. ran second of some seven candidates. The ticket headed by Thieu and Ky received but 34 percent of the vote. We now know that this election was rigged. We know that Thieu and Ky denied the right to vote to many thousands of men and women they termed neutralists. They denied the right to vote to all men and women they termed Communists. They denied a place on the presidential ticket to ""Big Minh"" the popular former President of South Vietnam. His civilian government was overthrown by the midnight coup in June 1965 led by 10 generals. nine of whom. including Thieu and Air Marshal Ky. were born in North Vietnam. and these men. including Ky. fought along with the French Armed Forces against their fellow countrymen seeking national liberation. They arrested Big Minh. and he was exiled to Thailand. Fearing his popularity. they barred him from becoming a candidate in the 1967 election. The regime in Saigon is a military dictatorship maintained in office by our Armed Forces and CIA. and despised by 80 percent of the people of South Vietnam. It is notoriously corrupt. Freedom of speech is suppressed. The number of political prisoners languishing in Saigon jails is unknown. but is certainly In the thousands. It includes many of South Vietnams leading intellectuals. religious leaders. lawyers. students. newspaper editors. and anyone who has dared to advocate measures to end the war. The militarist leaders of the Saigon government represent an old and vanished order. It is a certainty that they will be ousted the moment the South Vietnamese people again regain control of their own affairs. We Americans support a militarist dictatorial government in South Vietnam where the runnerup for president lands in jail. Truong Dinh Dzu advocated negotiations with leaders of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam to form a coalition government in Saigon. For this ""crime"" he was arrested. After a trial of 5 hours. he was immediately found guilty by the military judges and sentenced to 5 years at hard labor in an island prison. Now ""generous"" leaders of the Saigon government our GIs are maintaining in power have transferred him from that island prison to the Saigon jail as he had suffered a severe heart attack and no doctor was available there to treat a prisoner seriously ill with heart disease.

The Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund consists of a group of Vietnam and Vietnamera veterans who are employed in professional positions in the Washington. D.C..area. They have begun a nonpartisan effort to build an extensive and artistically sound memorial to those who fought and died in the Vietnam war. and I am proud to lend my own support to their effort. I should point out that they are not asking for any funding whatsoever from our Government. They have developed sufficient funding resources from the people of this country. They merely desire a parcel of land on which to build the monument. The site they propose. and which I endorse. would constitute 2 acres in Constitutional Gardens. on the mall. The monument. which would be built subject to the approval of the National Commission on Fine Arts. would blend in with existing landscaping in the gardens. and would enhance. rather than detract from. that portion of our national capitol. We have been struggling. as a Nation. to resolve the many remaining divisions from the Vietnam war. I do not need to catalog for you. Mr. Speaker. or for my colleagues. the enormous emotional and political complexities that come into play every time anything even tangential to that era is discussed. But I have always maintained that the key to resolving Vietnam. to our assimilating that experience into our national mindset. is for us to accord the Vietnam veteran the dignity of his experience. Of all the elements in this country who were involved with Vietnam. he suffered most. And of all the elements. he has received the least amount of benefit for his suffering. We have only to look right here in the halls of Congress to verify that notion. Mr. Speaker. After World War II. the Congress filled with returning veterans. It is now 7 years since the last American fired a shot in anger in Vietnam. Where are the veterans? The resolution I introduce today represents a major step in showing those veterans that we. as a Nation. sincerely appreciate their service. It will give every man and woman who served in Vietnam something tangible in our Nations Capitol. a memorial to their service and to their comrades who gave this country the ultimate gift. their lives. It is only fitting that such a memorial should be erected on the mall. as outlined in the resolution. Nine and 10 years ago our media brought great attention and dignity to the notion of dissent when others in the Vietnamera age group gathered on the mall to protest the war. even as our soldiers and sailors and airmen and marines were dying unheralded in combat. It is now up to the Congress to bring a longdeserved dignity to those who answered the call. at great personal cost. It is their turn to gather on the mall. Mr. Speaker. and when I notice that one portion of this memorial will contain the names of every man who died in Vietnam. I cannot think of a more appropriate group to be permanently enshrined there. I hope that all of my colleagues will join me in this most deserving effort.\n',today pleasure introduce resolution hope receive quick unanimous support entire body consist group veteran employ professional position area begin nonpartisan effort build extensive sound memorial fight die war proud lend own support effort point ask funding develop sufficient funding resource people country desire parcel land build monument site propose endorse constitute acre mall monument build subject approval blend exist landscaping garden enhance detract portion national capitol struggle nation resolve many remain division war need catalog colleague enormous emotional political complexity come play time tangential era discuss maintain key resolve assimilate experience national mindset accord veteran dignity experience element country involve suffer element receive least amount benefit suffering look hall verify notion fill return veteran year last fire_shot anger veteran resolution introduce today represent major step show veteran nation appreciate service give man woman serve tangible memorial service comrade give country ultimate gift life fitting_memorial erect mall outline resolution year medium bring great attention dignity notion dissent other age group gather mall protest war soldier_sailor airman_marine die unheralded combat bring longdeserve dignity answer call great personal cost turn gather mall notice portion memorial contain name man die think appropriate group enshrine hope colleague join deserving effort.\n,96.0,bound,1,0

I rise today to introduce legislation that will give preschool children the chance they deserve to enter school ready to learn by giving parents the tools they need to prepare their children to succeed educationally. A Better Chance [ABC] To Learn Act addresses the first and most compelling national education goalthat by the year 2000. all children will start school ready to learnby harnessing the energies of parents as their childrens first and most influential teachers. Schools today are called upon to cure a vast array of societys ills. and many Government dollars are spent in remediating educational and other deficiencies hampering the development of children from their earliest years in school. The bill I am introducing today will not cure all of those ills or remedy all of those deficiencies. What It will do Is provide knowledge and support to parents and inspire them to help ensure the educational readiness and progress of their children. It will ena hance the role of parents in building an ethic of learning at home and in easing the transition of children from preschool to kindergarten and beyond. Education reform is high on our national agenda these days--as well it should be--and we are all striving to ensure that our public schools offer education of the highest quality. What we must remember. however. Is that even the best school in the world cannot carry the entire burden of educatIng a child. Children must learn from their parentsor In some families. from their grandparents or other relatives--how to learn in school. and parents must reinforce at home what their children learn at school. Schools cannot replace parents. In a recent column. William Raspberry urged communities to establish programs to teach parents of young children techniques for preparing their youngsters to enter school. He cited one simple and pragmatic reason: ""If parents dont value learning and show their children that they do. schools are hard put to make up the difference."" This bill authorizes Federal matching grants to encourage and assist communities to establish. expand. or operate innovative. homebased parent and early childhood education programs that provide guidance and actively involve parents in preparng their children to begin school and in fostering positive attitudes toward education and learning. I cannot think of a more worthwhile longterm Investment in our educational system and our future. An alarming number of children in this country begin school unprepared for formal education. Seven thousand kindergarten teachers surveyed by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching in 1991 found that 35 percent of the Nations children were not ready for school. When asked to assess the readiness of students compared to those enrolled 5 years earlier. 42 percent of the teachers responded that the situation was getting worse. In response to the question ""What would most improve the school readiness of children."" 64 percent responded. ""Parent education."" In his address to a joint session of Congress on February 17. President Clinton challenged us to use the ""authority and the influence and the funding of the Education Department to promote strategies that really work in learning."" Research shows that engaging parents in the deduction of their children Is one strategy that really works. It makes a big difference in how much and how well children learn. We need only take a leaf from the book of the Japanese whose educational system. while not perfect. is extraordinarily successful. The Japanese stress the importance of partnerships among parents. teachers. and students and the value of parental involvement In education beginning in the preschool years. In particular. they place a high priority on providing a rich environment for learning at home aS a foundation for the entry of their children into elementary school. Of course. parents In this country want the very best for their children. too. Nonetheless. lack of time. support. and knowledge. loss of community. and competing pressures often prevent parents from preparing their children adequately to begin school. Oneparent families are increasing. and the demands on all parents can sometimes be overwhelming. In fact. children from many different backgrounds and from all income levels were among those 35 percent of children found unprepared for school In the Carnegie survey. Certainly severe poverty and extreme educational disadvantage in families account for many of the school readiness deficiencies found among young children. But many children of working poor and near poor parents and parents who have had limited. and often unsuccessful. schooling themselves also begin school without a solid foundation. Think of yourself as a parent with small children. Of course you want to provide the very best start in life for your children. Of course you want them to have an even better chance to succeed than you may have had. And. of course. you are willing to help and work with your children yourself. You look at the children and wonder what they will be 25 years from now. But. what do you do--and how? Will what you do be effective? You are not trained as a teacher. have no materials and are not sure where to begin. If you yourself have not been able to finish or succeed in school. you may have even more questions. You may not have the resources or the support of your family or community to find the answers. Millions of parents across the country face the same dilemma. I support Head Start and early childhood education programs funded under chapter 1 and believe that these programs should be expanded to serve all those eligible. Head Start and chapter 1. however. are targeted primarily at communities with the highest percentage of educationally and/or economically disadvantaged. For example. 90 percent of the children in each Head Start Program must be from families whose incomes fall below the official Federal poverty guidelinein 1993. $14.350 for a family of four--or who are receiving public assistance. The workIng poor and near poor generally do not qualify for these programs. And even if Head Start and chapter 1 were to be fully funded today. these families would not be eligible to receive services that they often need and seek. In authorizing grants. A Better Chance to Learn Act gives special consideration to those families who fall through the cracks in our current educational system and whose numbers are increasing in my State of Ohio as they are in other States around the country. They are: First. working poor and near poor families who do not qualify for Head Start or chapter 1 early childhood programs. Second. families who qualify for Head Start and chapter 1 programs but who are not served by them. Head Start currently serves only about 30 percent of the eligible children. and the preschool programs funded through chapter 1 are relatively small in number. and Third. children of parents with limited and/or successful formal schooling. The model for the innovative. homebased parent and early childhood education programs in this bill is the Home Instruction Program for Preschool Youngsters. known as HIPPY. HIPPY was developed in Israel in the late 1960s and is now operating in nine countries. including Germany. The Netherlands. New Zealand. Israel. and the United States. HIPPY currently serves over 10.000 families in 61 programs in 18 States in the United States. including 31 sites and a regional training center in Arkansas. Since Its inception In 1989. a very successful HIPPY in Warrensville. OH. has served nearly 140 disadvantaged children in a community which previously had no other public preschool program or social services. The Warrensville program attends to the needs of families such as those this bill targets. HIPPY ellgibdlity factors focus on the educational background of the pwrtictpating parent and the economic status of the family. but. in. the words of the Warrensville program director. ""* * there remain parents wha need what is offered. but who may not be eligible for enrollment. in other programs with much stricter and inflexible guidelines."" Warreneville and other local HIPPY programs are struggling to survive and. in fact. see a need to expand. other communities around Ohio and the country are seeking support to establish HIPPY programs of their own. Parents participating in HIPPY learn how to work with their children for 15 to 2D minutes per day. 5 days a week. using educational materials specially designed and structured to enhance school readiness. This approach is wholly consistent with the first national education goal. which states as its objective that ""every parent in America will be a childs first teacher and devote time elch day to helping his or her preschool child learn. and that parents will have access to the training and support they need."" I believe such innovative. homebased parent and early childhood education programs will work because: They demand the direct and active involvement of parents in the education of their children and foster a positive parentchild relationship. They are particularly cost effective. requiring no capital investments of classrooms or transportation. the average annual cost nationwide for HIPPY is approximately $1.000 per child. Their eligibility guidelines are focused but not rigid. local coordinators are given the flexibility tor make decisions regarding community needs. They are relatively small in size. can be tailored to individual communities. and work well in both urban and rural setting& Through home visits and group meetings. they serve the needs of hardtoreach families. helping them to connect with their communities and. their childrens schools. I would like to see such- programs replicated in DEyton. Akron. Cincinnati. Columbus. and other communities in need in Ohio and the rest of the country. I believe that parents want to give their children a better chance to succeed in school and to develop a love and excitement for learning. Many parents need and are seeking guidance and support to ensure that their children reach that goal. We must assist communities in extending services to them so that they might realize their full potential as their childrens first and most important teachers--and we can do so. without budgetbusting new expenditures. To quote William Raspberry again. ""* * * if we are serious about education. weve- got to look at more than schools. Mr. President.

I am talking about matters Which are matters of record. I am talking about figures which are official. and if gentlemen who have asked me on the other side whether I disagree with the message of the President. whether I disagree with the distinguished chaiman of the Committee on Appropriations of this House. being. as they are. such able gentlemen themselves. would follow these figures. I should be glad to have them contradict what I am saying if it be not true. The truth is that all agitation about the failure of the Dingley law to produce revenue has been an absurdity from start to finish. It is impossible from the nature of things to have the receipts of the Government absolutely square with the expenditures of the Government for any given year. It is impossible because. in the first place. nobody can by any possibility tell just what the receipts will be. and in the next place nobody can by any possibility tell exactly what the expenditures will be. Every year our Government incurs ex.739 penses which nobody could have dreamed ofthree or four million dollars a few years ago on account of the San Francisco disaster. I but mention that as an illustration to show you how utterly impossible it is to have any very accurate notion -of what the expenditures of the Government will be. It is equally impossible to tell what the revenues. the receipts of the Government. will be. Now. a good tariff law. a good revenueraising law. is one that will do exactly what the Dingley law has donesome years raise more revenue than needed. and some years raise less revenue than needed for -current expenses. but always keeping a safe. satisfactory amount in the Treasury of the United States. I tried to make this same point. for it was applicable then. on the 15th day of February. 1905. At that session of Congress everybody will remember that every time a member of the Appropriations Committee talked about expending anything the gentleman from Maine. the distinguished gentleman then -a Representative in this House. Mr. Littlefield. kept asking what we were going to do with reference to the state of the Treasury. asserting that we were running behind all the time. The available cash balance in the Treasury then was $141.000.000. Whenever the Treasury. under the Republican party. gets down to $140.000.000between that and $150.000.000I have observed that a cry of alarm goes up all over the country. The administration. the tendency to spend money. everything begins to be a subject of criticism from the Democratic side. Then. unfortunately. that alarm spread to the Republicans and alarmed the country. while we sit quiet and do not sufficiently answer -their criticism. I called attention in that speech in 1905 to this remarkable fact. that while the Democratic party was criticising us because we did not have then. with $140.000.000 in the Treasury. enough revenue. and was criticising us with such vigor that some Re.publicans. even so able as the one I have mentioned. were alarmed. there was actually more money in the Treasury of the United States than there was in 1888. when Grover Cleveland alarmed the country. because he said that under the iniquitous tariff laws of the Republican party we were piling up a dangerous surplus in the Treasury. When Grover Cleveland alarmed the country because the tariff policy of the Republican party was piling up a dangerous surplus we had $3.000.000 less in the Treasury of the United States than there is in the Treasury of the United States today.\n',gentleman correct glad information matter spread other side talk matter matter record talk figure official gentleman ask other side disagree message disagree distinguished chaiman such able gentleman follow figure glad contradict say be true truth agitation failure law produce revenue absurdity start finish impossible nature thing receipt square expenditure give year impossible first place possibility tell receipt next place possibility tell expenditure year government incur pense dream ofthree dollar few year account disaster mention illustration show impossible accurate notion expenditure government impossible tell revenue receipt good tariff law good revenueraising law law donesome year raise more revenue need year raise less revenue need -current expense keep safe satisfactory amount try make same point applicable 15th day session remember time member talk expend gentleman distinguished gentleman keep ask go reference state assert run time available cash balance republican party get observe cry alarm go country administration tendency spend money begin subject criticism democratic side alarm spread alarm country sit quiet answer -their criticism call attention speech remarkable fact democratic party criticise enough revenue criticise such vigor re.publican able one mention alarm more money alarm country say iniquitous tariff law republican party pile dangerous surplus alarm country tariff policy republican party pile dangerous surplus less today.\n,61.0,bound,1,0

I maintain that while the Government of the United States holds this ground by deed or conveyance as any other. proprietor holds land. there is a condition annexed which we require of the States. that no tax or burden shallbe laid by the State upon theground which is owned by the United States for this purpose. There is no disagreement between the gentleman from Pennsylvania and myself with reference tothepower of States ormunicipalities to tax or burden this property of the United States. I hold. and so does he. as I understand. that itis not within thepowerof the States or municipalities to tax or burden this property in such a way that it may be sold as the property of private individuals may he for the nonpayment of taxes. But I hold. that as the Government of the United States has accepted this property as an owner and as all citizens whose property abuts upon the streets adjacent to these public buildings can be compelled by the State or municipality to pay for improving the streets to the center. subject to the penalty of having their property sold for the tax if they refuse to pay it. the Government of the United States ought not as a proprietor to insist that because of the stipulation that the property of the Government shall not be subjected to any tax or burden by State authority therefore thd Government will not pay for paving to the center of the streets in front of its property. In other words. having forced the citizens who owned private property to submit to an assessment to pay the cost of paving to- the center of the street. the great Government of this country should not set itself up and say. ""We refuse to bear any part of the expense of paving the streets upon which our property abuts."" I admit that under the law the Government can not be compelled to bear any part of this expense. but I say the Government should pay its fair share as a matter of right and justice. The private owner whose property abuts upon the streets can be compelled to pay for paving to thecenter. and the Government. although it can not be compelled to pay in the same way. should step in and say. ""We require nothing of the private citizen that we are not ready and willing to do ourselves."" That is my proposition. there is where I stand. I say that in justice. in fair dealing and honesty. in common decency we should do this. If the Government stands out and says. "" We will pay no part of the expense of making pavements or building sewers."" then you may have onehalf the streets upon which the Government property abuts dnpaved. you may have no sewerage. you may have your buildings isolated entirely from the improvements of the cities where they are located. I wish to add that in many cases -I have not a statement of them in detail. but I believe the gentlemen from Missouri bas a statement in regard to a number of cases--the Government has borne its share of these expenses.

We have diligently studied the many complex decontrol and deregulation proposals but have reached no solution for energy independence. We have most recently shifted our hopes toward synthetic fuels and advanced recovery techniques in our quest for the magic formula. But in fact. we have had trouble identifying the real issue. The key to our fight against OPEC. and the key to the door which leads down the path of energy independence. is not simply decontrol. deregulation. or synthetic fuel development but is clearly dependent on discipline. sacrifice. and conservation. On August 3. 1979. I introduced S. 1704. the Highway and Public Transportation Improvement Act of 1979. Although this legislation is by no means the solution to our energy problems. it represents the recognition of a simple fact: we consume too much gasoline. In short. S. 1704 would reduce our consumption of gasoline in two ways. First. it is well understood that more roads generate more cars and that more cars consume a greater amount of gasoline. S. 1704 would abolish the Highway Trust Fund effective September 30. 1980. and therefore. remove the existing bias toward highways in Federal transportation funding. Second. by abolishing the fund. we will allow greater flexibility to States and localities to evaluate their specific transportation needs and thereby encourage the use of Federal funds for mass transit alternatives where appropriate. The Highway Trust Fund outlived its purpose long ago. A splendid interstate highway system has been substantially completed. the billions in the fund should not be locked in when other transportation needs are evident. It is important that Congress begin to recognize the need to weigh our many naional needs and seek a better balance in the use of our limited financial resources. Mr. President. this is not the first time I have addressed the issue of conservation. nor will it be the last. If we really want to move out of the grasp of OPEC. and if we really want to move toward eventual energy independence. we must focus on the small steps. the disciplined steps. that will lead us to our goal. We simply must reduce our gas consumption and building new roads Is not consistent with this end. I ask that the bill and an executive summary be printed in the RECORD.

The legislation. known as the Euratom Cooperation Act of 1958. instituted a cooperative program between the United States and a group of six European nations to develop the peaceful uses of nuclear power. We were outstandingly successful in attaining the objective of encouraging the peaceful uses of nuclear power as a review of the situation in Europe will disclose. The degree of success we attained is indicated by the title of an article in the July 1977 issue of Nuclear Engineering International. The title of the article to which I refer is ""Europe Outpacing U.S."" I would like to include the article at the conclusion of my remarks for the information of all of those interested in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. I would like to highlight a few of the accomplishments in this successful inlernational cooperation program. Under the program. the first system for safeguarding nuclear material from diversion for other than peaceful purposes was developed. Of course. such safeguards only have meaning when they are applied on an international basis. Under the Euratom program. the technology for the safe use of nuclear energy in the civilian economy was advanced both in Europe and the United States. Our industry was advanced a great deal under the program while at the same time. the benefits of the peaceful atom were brought to our foreign friends. The group of nations who worked with on this program are now advancing at a faster rate than we are in realizing the benefits of nuclear energy. The nine nations that comprise what is now known as the European Economic Community. have made the financing of electricity producing facilities. especially nuclear. a priority goal in their energy program. As indicated in the article which follows. the European Community is now expanding their nuclear capacity at a faster rate than we are. The importance which the Europeans attach to this prime energy source is also indicated in the buildup of the equipment industry in Europe to supply the increased nuclear generating capacities. This increased industrial capacity. of course. is taking over from American industry. The American share of the European market has. in fact. dropped from 64.5 percent in 1967 to 54 percent at the beginning of 1977.

In these last years. weve seen the answer. and it is no surprise. Wall Street serves Wall Street. It could care less about the lives they ruin while seeking profits and bonuses. The Bush administration allowed Wall Street banks to chase profit by building their growth on a weak foundation of risky debt. Their scheme collapsed. They held Americas savings hostage. Congress could not afford to let them fail. so they couldnt lose. Of course. they didnt. America lost. The International Monetary Fund estimates these gambles have destroyed nearly $3 trillion of economic value. Recently. economists have estimated the entire cost of World War II to be. roughly. the same. In other words. Wall Street banks devised a way to make billions in profits and bonuses while wiping out the savings of millions of Americans. They cannot be allowed to do that again.

I simply want to express my hearty concurrence in what has been said by the distinguished. Senator from Kentucky and the able Senator from Michigan . It strikes me as rather singular that whenever a question of this character comes up in the Senate for considerationa question involving certain property interests. especially when the interests of that class of our people who are best able to bear the hurden of taxationthe matter assumes at once a very abstruse and diflicult form. and in order that eternal justice shall be (lone it becomes necessary to have the whole matter passed ipon by a conmission composed of mien possessing expert knowledge. Tere seems to be a growing disposition on the part of certain Members of this body that the Congress is incapable of dealing with any question affecting the profits of the rich folk without first referring the question to .I commission. Senators discuss this question with a Delphic air. as though It were shrouded. in inscrutable mystery. Now. I do not think this a very healthy sign. Personally I am opposed to legislation by commission. I believe the further we get away from the people the more inclined the officer is to neglect the public interests. Congress was created by the Constitution charged with tile duty and power of makinglawslevying taxes and otherwise legislating for the public good. And I am il favor of Congress performing that function and not delegating it to aly other power. If not the purpose. the effect of this reference will be to defeat taxation on this particular form of propertya form of property which is best able to bear the burden of government. whose strong arm it always promptly invokes for its protection. You may lay the hand of taxation upon the widow. you can tax the orplian to pauperization. you can pile up mountain high on the aching stoop of the laboring man every form of taxation. and nobody raises a question or seems disturbed about it. Congress is -mply able. offhand. without special deliberation to levy a tax upon the toilers and wealth producers of this Republic. but when you propose to tax money. levy tribute upon invisible wealth. which is possessed by that class of our population who get more out of the Government and do less for it than anybody else. then Senators insist upon taking it under consideration to give Congress an opportunity to pray over it lest some injustice be done to the innocent. helpless. patriotic rich. I sincerely hope that the amendment proposed by the Senator from South Dakota may be agreed to. and if it is not altogether perfect in every detail. if there is the slightest injustice that may result from it. there is no doubt about Congress correcting the mistake at once.

The bill carries money for meeting the amount of tax that for years had been levied on the Coos Bay Wagon Road grant lands. Many years ago the Coos Bay Wagon Road project. as well as railroad projects. was aided by the Federal Government through the gift of lands under certain conditions. one of which was that the lands should be sold at not more than a certain price. The recipients of some of these grants violated the terms of the grant. and suit was instituted by the Government for their recovery. These suits were successful. and the Government recovered a large amount of the land. In the meantime. however. counties in which the lands were located had acted upon the assumption that the lands were private lands. Counties were bonded. and these lands in common with other privately owned property were responsible through taxation for interest and for sinking fund. But when cancellation occurred. at once these lands were swept from the tax rolls. Counties were defaulting in their bonds and interest in obligations that had been incurred in good faith. To meet the situation. a few years ago the Congress passed an act providing that certain proceeds from these lands should be paid in lieu of taxes and should go to these counties until the lands should again pass to private ownership.\n',think explain item bill carry money meet amount tax year levy grant land many year project railroad project aid gift land certain condition land sell more certain price recipient grant violate term grant suit institute recovery suit successful recover large amount land meantime county land locate act assumption land private land county bond land common other own property responsible taxation interest sink fund cancellation occur land sweep tax roll county default bond interest obligation incur good faith meet situation few year pass act provide certain proceed land pay lieu taxis go county land pass private_ownership.\n,72.0,bound,1,0

Now. from these figures it appears that at Pensacola. Fla.. the receipts for pilotage from foreign tonnage in the year ended June 30. 1895. was $49.221. to be divided among 41 men. This would amount to $1.200 and upward for each man. That. you will observe. relates to the pilotage fees on foreign vessels. without taking into any account the steam or sailing vessels in the coastwise trade that paid pilotage fees at that port. Mr. OBrien. a very intelligent pilot. who appeared before the committee. stated that there had been 19 or 20 steam vessels engaged in the coastwise American trade entering that port during the year. and that they had all taken on a pilot and paid pilotage fees. and that they did it voluntarily. The amount of fees paid by these vessels the committee has no means of knowing. Mr. OBrien stated frther that the pilotage association were at some considerable expense. He said the pilot boat cost some ten or twelve thousand dollars to build. and that every two or three years it would require some repairs. new sails. etc. He did not say what the expense of the repairs would be. but if out of the $49.000 received from foreign tonnage they paid $8.000 a year in repairs. these 41 pilots would clear an income of upward of a thousand dollars a year. and evidently they would not starve under that system in the port of Pensacola. What further do they say of this port of Pensacola? Why. that even if the compulsory system of pilotage were abolished. no sailing vessel could be sailed in by a sailing master even though skillful as a pilot. that the sand and the shoals shifted so much that the master of the vessel could not sail his vessel in. as he could not be familiar with the shifting currents and the changing conditions of the entrance to the harbor. or. in other words. that he would be compelled to employ the services of some pilot even if this bill passed. Evidently if that be true these gentlemen in Pensacola will not be cut down below the $1.500 a year which they are now receiving41 of themto pilot in and out of that harbor these vessels that may come there each year. At Tampa there were but four pilots. and the fees were excessively large. The income was so great that the board of pilot commissioners of the State of Florida cut the fees down onehalf. they having that power under the statute. And still these gentlemen must receive a very comfortable income. because the pilotage fees paid on foreign vessels alone in Tampa amount to over $6.000 a year. to be divided between four pilots. making $1.500 each. even if they did not receive a dollar from the American coastwise vessels. But. Mr. Speaker. it is evident that the American sailing master can get his own vessel into the port of Charleston. he can get it into the ports of Virginia. the ports of Georgia or Alabama or Texas. without the aid of a licensed pilot. because their legislatures have solemnly declared that such was the fact. That being the case. we say that this tax. for it is nothing more or less than a tax. should be removed from the vesselsthe small vessel ownersand that there should be some chance afforded to the American sailors as well as to the American pilots. But what are the objections urged against the passage of the bill? They say it will deprive some of the pilots of their comfortable living. that it will cut down their salaries or cut down the number of pilots. Well. Mr. Speaker. if that is true. are we to tax the commerce of the country for the support of individuals? Are we to tax the American carrying trade to support comfortably some gentlemen who. under the laws of the State. constitute the pilots of that port or the pilots association? They say that it will destroy the value of a million dollars worth of boats owned by these pilot associations throughout the United States. Why. they come to us from Pensacola. Fla.. and say that they have already themselves destroyed the value of six pilot boats. because a few years ago they had eight boats. but they have consolidated. ""Now. do not think this is a trust."" says a pilot from Pensacola. ""because we have consolidated. but we found that with eight boats we were eating each other up. and now we use only two boats and have an association."" Fortyone pilots standing in each others way in two boats. And what are these associations? Why. Mr. Chairman. I have a letter from Fernandina. Fla.. which says: Now. I want to give you a little idea of the condition of things here and the close corporation that our Florida laws make for these associations. You will sec by consulting our Florida law on this subject that the business of bar pilots is turned over to the association at each bar. and that business is transmitted to the heirs and family and kindred of those in position with the certainty and regularity of an English land estate. No one can be a pilot without apprenticeship of four years. and so no one but a relative in some degree of the active pilots can get into the circle. I have been familiar with the workings of the pilot business here for twenty years. and I know of nothing short of Tammany that equals it as an organization for power and plunder. The board of pilot commissioners are changed with considerable regularity. and always at the dictation of the pilots association. That association is the most efficieit for political management and influence of any or all the forces in any locality where they operate. I can well believe this from what I have seen of it since this bill has been before our committee. There are 13 pilots now combined in one organization in this place. They divide amona them not less than J).000 per annum. as I am assured. Some of these arooys just out of their apprenticeship. who could not in any of the other associations of life for which their education would fit them command S40 per month. They are all of the younger descendants of the old pilots. or in some way descended from them or the relatives.\n'",paper hand committee deriye source refer figure appear receipt pilotage foreign tonnage year end divide man amount man observe relate pilotage_fee foreign vessel take account steam_sailing vessel coastwise_trade pay pilotage_fee port intelligent pilot appear committee state steam vessel engage_coastwise american trade enter port year take pilot pay pilotage_fee amount fee pay vessel committee mean know state frther pilotage association considerable expense say pilot boat cost dollar build year require repair new sail say expense repair receive foreign tonnage pay year repair pilot clear income dollar year starve system port say port compulsory system pilotage abolish sailing_vessel sail sailing master skillful pilot sand shoal shift master vessel sail vessel familiar shift current change condition entrance harbor other word compel employ service pilot bill pass be true gentleman cut year receiving41 pilot harbor vessel come year pilot fee large income great board pilot commissioner cut fee onehalf have power statute gentleman receive comfortable income pilotage_fee pay foreign vessel amount year divide pilot make receive dollar american coastwise_vessel evident american sailing master get own vessel port get port port aid licensed_pilot legislature declare such fact case say tax more less tax remove small vessel ownersand chance afford american sailor american pilot objection urge passage bill say deprive pilot comfortable living cut salary cut number pilot true tax commerce country support individual tax carry trade support gentleman law constitute pilot port pilot association say destroy value dollar worth boat own pilot association come say destroy value pilot boat few year boat consolidate think trust say pilot consolidate find boat eat other use boat association fortyone pilot stand other boat association letter say want give little idea condition thing close corporation law make association sec consult law subject business bar pilot turn association bar business transmit heir family kindre position certainty regularity english land estate one pilot apprenticeship year one relative degree active pilot get circle familiar working pilot business year know short equal organization power plunder board pilot commissioner change considerable regularity dictation pilot association association most efficieit political management influence force locality operate believe see bill committee pilot combine organization place divide amona less annum assure arooy apprenticeship other association life education fit command month young descendant old pilot way descend relatives.\n,54.0,bound,1,0

I introduce for myself and my distinguished colleague. Senator DENTON. a bill to rename the Jones Bluff Lock and Dam on the Alabama River in honor of the late Dr. Robert F. Henry of Montgomery. Ala.. who died on August 14. 1981. Dr. Henry was an outstanding Alabamian. He was a civic leader. churchman. and educator. He also served as president of BirminghamSouthern College. Although Dr. Henry served the people of his State and his Nation in many civic and charitable ways. he is better remembered for his yeoman efforts in behalf of the full and comprehensive development of the CoosaAlabama River system. The development of this mighty river system has been the quest of farsighted men such as Dr. Henry for many years. The improvement of the CoosaAlabama River system for flood control. power production. navigation. and other purposes was authorized in 1945 and subsequently modified in the River and Harbor Act of 1954. In 1956. the moving force behind this proposal. namely. the CoosaAlabama River Improvement Association. elected Dr. Henry as its president and Dr. Henry served continuously as the chief executive officer of the association until his death. Funds for the construction of locks and dams on the river system did not come easy. As a matter of fact. it was not until 1961 that the first planning moneys were approved for the locks and dams. During this time Dr. Henry would head up large delegations of citizens in presenting the case for this river system before the Senate and House Appropriations Committees here in Washington. His leadership and persistence paid dividends. Today the Alabama River is fully developed for power production. flood control. and navigation. At the time of his death. Dr. Henry was working diligently in behalf of improving the Coosa River for navigation from Montgomery to Gadsden. Ala.. thence to Rome. Ga. One of the most imposing structures on the CoosaAlabama is the Jones Bluff Lock and Dam on the Alabama River between Lowndes and Autauga Counties. It was one of the first projects targeted by Dr. Henry in his quest to develop the river system. The naming of this majestic dam in honor of Dr. Henry would be most fitting and appropriate recognition of his tireless efforts in behalf of the development of the river system. as well as his commitment to a bigger and better economic day for the citizens of his State.

I want to congratulate the gentleman particularly on his foresight in bringing to this Congress the resolution calling for the establishment of the Captive Nations Committee. I think it is extremely important that this committee be established at once. Such a committee would be a factfinding group. It would. by the process of hearings and studies. permit a continuous and systematic study of all the captive nations of Europe and Asia. Such a committee could make available to our Ambassador at the United Nations information that would present forcefully and accurately the situation with reference to these Russianoccupied and Russiansubmerged nations. I think that when the true facts are properly disseminated it will advance the cause of peace and freedom.

I wish to speak to the proceedings that have just taken place this evening and try to put them in some context. What we have had before this Chamber is a bill that is very important to putting the American economy back on track. Lots of folks have looked at the various chokepoints in our economy. and so many have found that one of the critical issues is the access to lending by small businesses. That is a key provision in the bill before usthe ability to capitalize healthy community banks so they can make funds available to small businesses so small businesses can seize opportunities and put Americans back to work. There are many other terrific provisions in this small business jobs bill. They include. for example. a capital gains tax holiday that will assist small businesses. It includes a whole number of provisions. in fact. that stack up to $12 billion in tax reductions for small businesses. This bill came to this floor in a bipartisan way. with many provisions that were Republican provisions. some that were Democratic provisions. bipartisan support out of committee. It is before us now. and the question throughout this day has been this: Are the Republicans blocking this support for small businesses because they are opposed to helping small businesses and want to drive this economy back into a doubledip recession or do they have a legitimate concern that they should get a chance to offer amendments on the floor of the Senate? To put that issue to rest. our majority leader made the following proposal: Our colleagues across the aisle would get three amendments. The Democrats on this side of the aisle would get three amendments. Both sides get to choose the amendments they want to bring forward. That is a legitimate debate about small business. That gives everybody a chance to weigh in. That certainly addresses any procedural issue. What was the response of the Republican leadership? The Republican leadership responded and said: No. we want four amendments. and we also want to control what the Democratic amendments are. In other words. we want to have the say on eight amendments while the Democrats choose none. Of course. it becomes very clear: The Republican intent is not to have a debate about taking our Nation forward and getting out of recession. it is to block bills that will help our small businesses and put this economy back on track. I say to my colleagues across the aisle. there is too much at stake for this sort of outrageous political competition. Put your November thoughts aside. I say to my friends. and focus on what is right for the economy of this Nation. what is right for the small businesses of this Nation. Lets have the three amendments on each side as each side would choose. Lets get it done. and then lets go home and know we are working together in a problemsolving. bipartisan fashion to make our communities stronger. to create employment opportunities for our working families. and to strengthen our economy as a whole.\n',wish speak proceeding take place evening try put context bill important put american economy track lot folk look various chokepoint economy many find critical issue access lending small business key provision bill usthe ability capitalize healthy community bank make fund available small business small business seize opportunity put work many other terrific provision small business job bill include example capital_gain tax holiday assist small business include whole number provision fact stack tax reduction small business bill come floor bipartisan way many provision republican provision democratic provision bipartisan support committee question day block support small business opposed help small business want drive economy doubledip_recession legitimate concern get chance offer amendment floor put issue rest majority_leader make follow proposal colleague aisle get amendment side_aisle get amendment side get choose amendment want bring legitimate debate small business give chance weigh address procedural issue response republican leadership republican leadership respond say want amendment want control democratic amendment other word want say amendment choose none become clear republican intent debate take nation get recession block bill help small business put economy track say colleague aisle much stake sort outrageous political competition put thought say friend focus right economy nation right small business nation let amendment side side choose get do let go know work problemsolving bipartisan_fashion make community strong create employment opportunity work family strengthen economy whole.\n,111.0,daily,0,1

I believe it is a godsend for us. It is called ""A Nuclear Black Market."" and it was a report issued under the auspices of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. It is very significant. because many of the participants in this study have great credibility with many Senators with reference to issues of this type. Arnaud De Borchgrave. who many know as former editor of the Washington Times. was the project director of this report. I am not going to make it a part of the RECORD. I am merely going to suggest to those who wonder whether this amendment moves us in the right direction. I suggest if they want the recommendations of this group. headed by the person that I just talked about. under the auspices of a very reliable thinktank group and containing the following prognosisand if this does not sound something like the speeches just given by Senators NUNN and LUGARlet me share it with you. The prognosis says--and that is all I will read and urge that Senators or their staffs interested should read itthe prognosis says: In the near term. several key variables in the nuclear smuggling equation appear likely to remain bad or may even worsen. Barring an unlikely economic turnaround in the former Soviet Union. struggling nuclear workers will continue to be tempted to steal material. Disarray in the Russian military is apt to worsen in the near term. threatening security at nuclear weapons storage sites. The current trafficking situation shows a disturbing upward trend. Substantial quantities of materials are likely to remain at large. and the potential for an accident or use of smuggled nuclear materials probably is increasing. partly as a result of dismantling. By contrast. certain trends are favorable. Improvements in the materials protection and controlled accounting in the former Soviet Union are progressing slowly. The number of deployed warheads and assembled weapons is shrinking and facilities are consolidating. Transit states are beginning to deploy technical detectors and are acquiring needed training and experience. Meanwhile. the international community is starting to respond to this severe challenge. Although any prediction is tenuous. the situation seems likely to get worse over the near term and will not improve unless immediate security enhancements are made. Then one might be surprised to read the recommendations. The recommendations begin to sound like this bill. For that. I am very pleased. because the three of us and our staffs and an assemblage of experts. not including those who put this report together. have worked very hard in an effort to bring a comprehensive bill before the U.S. Senate tonight. So. Mr. President. after yesterdays bombing in Saudi Arabia. my colleagues do not need to be reminded of the devastation of a conventional bomb. I am not aware of any of my colleagues who had the opportunity to observe an aboveground nuclear blast. but I believe my colleagues recognize the devastation that such an explosion would have if a nuclear weapon were to explode in New York City or in Indianapolis or in Atlanta or in Chicago. We are less familiar. however. with the threat of chemical weapons. although we do have some experience from the Tokyo subway incident. which has been discussed thoroughly here tonight. from observing the use of chemical weapons in the IranIraq war. and from dealing with accidental chemical leaks in events such as railroad car derailments. I think very few of us are aware of what could happen if a rogue nation or group attacked the United States with a biological device. The device could very well be made in a laboratory the size of a kitchen. My colleagues recognize all the equipment necessary to culture a biological agent. Most of it can be found in a high school or college chemistry laboratory. or ordered. I might say. from a number of mailorder houses in the United States and around the world. In that kitchen laboratory. the first drop of an agent would be cultured until it multiplied billions of times. To turn those germs into a weapon would be very straightforward. The biological agent would be placed in a container designed to open and disperse the material into the air. possibly with a small fan. The device would be most effective placed in locations of which significant airflows interact. And when that interacts with large numbers of people. they have almost a special place for this kind of destruction: A metro station. the airconditioning system of a large building. an airport. People passing through would breathe the agent into their lungs. where it would continue to multiply with every breath. The unknowing transporter would exhale some of the agent. to be breathed in by others. The first illness might not occur for several days. First. those directly exposed would start to die. Then their coworkers. their families. their friends would start to die. Initially hospitals would be overwhelmed. like we found when we have had viruses before. including the Ebola virus. The virus would flourish at the hospitals. turning them into killing grounds. I could go on. I do this because I truly think it is imperative that somehow we get the message to the policymakers of this country and ultimately to the people of this Nation that just as we amassed in the Manhattan project the greatest of our scientists with a mission. a mission to save America by developing the atomic bomb. it is imperative that we coordinate our best efforts and resources. our best scientists and technicians to lodge an attack on the impending potential disasters that can come from biological and chemical destruction and the forces that can be set forth and lay millions of people to waste. There are no easy answers.) But there were not easy answers to some of these gigantic technical and scientific problems that we have faced in the past. The longer we sit by and assume it will all be taken care of because a lot of people are working on these kinds of issues. the longer we are being fooled. So we have put together a bill that addresses these issues on many fronts. Clearly. it addresses the issue of the nuclear black market. That has already been discussed in great detail. I merely want to say to Senators who might wonder whether it is in Americas interests to negate this black market or whether it is in somebody elses interest. there can be no question. it is in our interest. the whole notion of a black market coming out of the Soviet Union. because they are dismantling. are in a state of disarray. building down their nuclear weapons. all of which contributes an enormous potential for the dissemination of those kinds of things from whence nuclear bombs can be made. It is in our interest that we continue. as difficult as it is. to put some resources into trying to tame that which is being loosed on the world through individual conduct in the Soviet Union and in some cases through organized conduct. The genie is out of the bottle there. but it behooves us to try to make that as small as humanly possible. And we can do better. If we adopt this amendment. and find the resources to fund it. it will be just another very positive stride in the direction of doing what is prudent for our people in reference to this very. very serious threat. It is kind of amazing and somewhat ironic that as we end the cold war. we turn loose a new hot substance. It is no longer necessarily the fleet of rockets aimed at us. but it is the tremendous inventory from plutonium to enriched uranium and everything in between that can be turned loose because a country cannot control its people and does not have the money to pay its scientists to keep working and do productive things. What a tremendous. difficult situation we are confronted with. difficult enough to do something serious about. . This bill clearly takes some giant steps in the right direction. It directs the Department of Defense to create an emergency response team similar to the Department of Energys nuclear emergency search team. This team could be called upon to locate and deactivate chemical or biological devices or try to contain them once detonated. The amendment directs the Departments of Energy and Defense to develop new technologies to detect the production and transportation of these agents. Just think of how tough this one is. But if we do not tell our scientists to try to find ways- to detect these devices and the places of their origin. then what chance do we have to make any real strides in inhibiting the. devastating potential. a little piece of which I described in my early remarks. Metro medical strike teams are established. I will not go into great detail. Joint exercises are provided for. and an effort to help our local law enforcement. not take over. but to help them become more proficient in this potential and thus more able to be of help and be part of prevention rather than wait until something happens and then have the clamor that nobody knew what to do. nobody was trained. We are smart enough to know that these things can happen. Tonight my two colleagues have already explained how they have already happened and how close we have come in our own country to a majorto a majorbiological disaster in New York City. There is much more I could say tonight. Most of my remaining remarks would have to do with the former Soviet Union and certain programs that are working fairly well. some that we ought to enhance and make better. But I will not do that because between Senators NUNN and LUGAR. they have touched on it. I am sure when Senator NUNN finishes his remarks tonight.. since he has started in this arena in the former Soviet Union. he will make additional remarks about what we ought to be doing. I merely want to say that I got some very good education about this from some of our national laboratories. I participated in two national seminars hosted by Los Alamos National Laboratory. and in the last case by them and Harvard University. when they brought the best thinkers together to tell us about the reality of this situation. Are we pipe dreaming or is it real? If it is real. what should we be doing about it? From those kinds of contacts. I have arrived at the conclusion that if one is going to leave a legacy around here. one ought to leave a legacy in this area of calling this kind of problem to the attention of the policymakers and then doing something about it. If one would have been part of originating the Manhattan project. one might have been very proud of having a part in assembling this massive talent. managed in an appropriate way. to bring America the first atomic bomb. The same thing might be happening here. for our great scientists might permit us to evolve from this legislation into something that might really preserve and save literally millions of people and literally millions of Americans now and in the future. Now. let me turn to the threat of nuclear weapons. At its peak in 1992. the Soviet Union possessed approximately 45.000 nuclear warheads and weapons grade nuclear material to fabricate thousandsmore. The Soviet Union also produced an unknown amount of highly enriched uranium for reactors and for their nuclear navy. That material is also weapons -usable.. While we will never know for certain how much of this material exists. the number 1.200 metric tons of weaponsusable material is frequently used. If one considers that a simple nuclear weapon requires 15 kilograms of highly enriched uranium and 4 kilograms wof plutonium. there is enough weapons usable nuclear material in Russia to build more than 63.000 nuclear. weapons. each of which could fit in a briefcase. That material cannot be accounted .forthe best concrete example we have is Project Sapphire. Project Sapphire occurred when the Government of Kazakhstan found 600 kilograms--enough material for 32 nuclear weaponsof highly enriched uranium that had been. inadvertently left in Kazakhstan when the Soviets left. Not only was 600 kilograms left behind. but the inventory of that material conducted according to Soviet measuring techniques was off by 4 per-> centenough to make almost two nuclear weapons. In the Sapphire case. the Department of Energy secured ithat material and transported it to the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. But. that case demonstrates how lacking inventory control systems. are in the formerSoviet Union. Even when the material is in dedicated storage facilities it represents a threat. At Chelyabinsk65. bulk plutonium is stored in a warehouse with glass windows and. a padlock on the door. Inside the facility are over 10.000 ingots of separated plutonium stored in thermossized : containersperfect for picking up and walking out. If the terrorists who tried to blow up the World Trade Center had used a nuclear weapon made of that weapons usable nuclear material. Manhattanall the way up to Gramercy Park. would have disappeared. If such a device had been set off in Oklahoma City. most of Oklahoma City would have disappeared. The examples I have given are using a simple weapon design that is available over the Internet. If a rogue nation were to hire a Russian weapons designer and have access to the necessary material. that designer could build a sophisticated. multiplestage weapon many times more powerful. My colleagues need to understand that the weapons used in Nagasaki and Hiroshima were much cruder designs than are easily available today. If a terrorist or rogue nation gains control of weapons usable nuclear materialthey immediately become a nuclear power more advanced than the United States was when we bombed Hiroshima and Nagasaki. We cannot let that happen. For the past 5 years. under the leadership of Senators NUNN and LUGAR. Congress has provided. $300400 million per year to address this problem. Unfortunately. when. the original legislation authorizing that work was enacted in 1991. it included numerous restrictions on its use. I understand why those restrictions were put in placewhen NunnLugar was first enacted. the hammer and sickle of the Soviet Empire still flew over Red Square. But there have been some real successesa lot of which resulted from the less formal interactions of the Department of Energy with their counterparts in the. Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy. It turns out that these scientists. ours at Los Alamos. Lawrence Livermore. and Sandia. and theirs at Arzamas. Tomsk. and Chelyabinsk. think alike. They have been following each others work for years and have tremendous respect for one another. So when the Cold War ended. they started getting together and found they have a great deal in common. Out of those informal relationships have developed some very important programs.\n'",last day interesting report forthcoming believe godsend call report issue auspex significant many participant study

880192301,S,19640406,541,Mr. KEATING,Unknown,KEATING,Unknown,M,23300,23559,04061964.txt,8821,529,88096631,KEATING,KENNETH,S,NY,M,R,,voting,"Mr. President. I am very grateful to my friend from Connecticut for allowing me to proceed at this time. due to the fact that the Subcommittee on the Aging is holding hearings today on an important subject.. I shall not be long. One of the arguments made against the pending civil rights bill is that it will interfere with States rights. It will be of interest. therefore. to consider the manner in which at least one of the States of the Union is exercising its responsibility to enforce the commands of equal protection and due process in the Constitution. In the last 4 weeks. while the Senate has been engaged in leisurely debate first on the question of whether to debate civil rights. and more recently on the bill itself. at least one State legislature. unencumbered by the filibuster rule and other such limitations on prompt action. has been considering a series of measures designed to turn the clock back on human freedom. These include: First. A bill to repeal the charter of Tougaloo University. a Negro college in Mississippi. The extended debate on civil rights frequently is defended by opponents of the measure as an educational campaign. But educating the people at home apparently involves too many perils. Second. A bill. reminiscent of the Black Codes adopted after the Civil War. which would grant municipalities the right to ""enhance the general welfare of the community by restricting the movements of the citizens or a group thereof. of such municipalities when there is imminent danger to the public safety because of freedom of movement thereof."" Third. A bill making it a felony. punishable by a fine of $5.000 or up to 5 years in prison. to threaten. intimidate. or coerce another person from lawfully trading or carrying on business. Another bill. making it a felony punishable by 5 years in prison and a $1.000 fine. to print or circulate any matter which would encourage economic boycotts has also been introduced. Those behind these measures evidently believe that selfhelp is as dangerous as new Federal laws to protect civil rights. but they have not yet suggested any other alternatives for enforcing the Constitution. Fourth. A bill to prohibit the distribution of Federal surplus food to needy persons without the authorization of county officials has also been offered. This is apparently aimed at an incident which occurred a few years ago. at which time the distribution of surplus foodlargely to Negroeswas halted on the order of local county officials. When national welfare organizations went to the State and distributed the food without authorization. the plans of the officials were thwarted and the legislature now wants to close this loophole. Fifth. A series of bills to perpetuate one party rule by making it as difficult as possible for any minority party candidates to get on the ballot. This law apparently is designed to supplement intimidation and the most restrictive voting procedures and laws in the Nation. as a means of perpetuating control by those now in power. It appears obvious that the sole purpose of these proposals is to stifle dissent and to make it almost impossible for any minority party or dissenting group to influence the state of affairs in this State of the Union. Aside from the laws which are being proposed. consider how some of the laws already on the books are being enforced. or disregarded. As a graphic example of the rule of law let us consider recent events in the town of Greenwood. Miss. Greenwood is the county seat of Leflore County. 64.6 percent of the population of the county is Negro. Of the 13.567 Negro citizens of voting age 258 were registered to vote in 1963. In 1955. 400 Negroes had been registered to vote. so it is evident that absolutely no progress has been made in terms of registering Negroes. under the 1957 and 1960 acts. In the summer of 1962. the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee began a voter registration drive in Lefiore County. The following is a list of Incidents which have occurred since that drive began: On August 26. 1962. four Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee staffers were forced to jump from a second story window to escape a mob carrying chains. In October 1962. the Leflore County Board of Supervisors voted to drop a surplus food program which had helped to sustain some 22.000 Negroes. mostly seasonal workers and sharecroppers. On February 20. 1963. three Negro businesses near the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee office were burned to the ground. Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee worker Sam Block said he thought the fires were ""an attempt to burn us out."" On February 22. 1963. Block was arrested and charged with ""making statements calculated to breach the peace."" On February 28. 1963. Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee worker James Travis was machinegunned by three men 7 miles from Greenwood. On March 5. 1963. two white men were arrested and charged with the Travis shooting. Their trial has been continued three times. On March 6. 1963. three Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee workers were shot at while sitting in a car outside the office. No one was injured. On March 24. 1963. the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee office was set on fire. On March 26. 1963. shotgun blasts were fired into a Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee workers home. On March 27. 1963. 10 Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee workers were arrested for inciting to riot after they escorted 100 Negroes to the courthouse to register. On March 30. 1963. the U.S. Department of Justice moved for a temporary restraining order. enjoining intimidation of voters and further detention and prosecution of those arrested on March On April 2. 1963. Greenwood police arrested a Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee worker and forcibly ejected Negro comedian Dick Gregory from the courthouse lawn. On April 4. 1963. the Justice Department withdrew its request for a temporary restraining order and Greenwood officials released those in jail. On May 17. 1963. Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee worker Milton Hancock was held under technical arrest after he was allegedly beaten in the jail. On June 18. 1963. in nearby Itta Bena. 45 Negroes were arrested after a voter registration meeting in a church was smokebombed. On June 25 and 26. 1963. 22 Negroes were arrested outside the Leflore County Courthouse as they tried to register to vote. On July 7. 1963. a tear gas bomb was thrown at a Negro cafe. On October 25. 1963. police arrested 10 Negroes on the courthouse steps. The 10 had been waiting to register to vote. November 2. 1963. five voter registration workers arrested for obstructing the sidewalk after they set up a mock polling booth in Greenwood. March 24. 1964. three crossesone a block from the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee office. one on the courthouse stepswere burned in Greenwood. March 26. 1964. George Davis was fired from his job after him employer said his picture. picketing. had been shown at a citizens council meeting. March 27. 1964. five students from Iowa State University were arrested. fingerprinted. photographed. and released. A Leflore County sharecropper and mother of nine. Mrs. Elizabeth Carter. was evicted because she tried to register to vote. March 30. 1964. a white volunteer worker was arrested. fingerprinted. photographed. and released. An integrated group tried to integrate the white restroom at the courthouseboth mens and womens Negro restrooms had been closedand were thrown out. A Negro woman who entered the white restroom was locked inside. Police Chief Curtis Lary told the demonstrators they could only picket the rear of the courthouse. These events which have occurred over the last 20 months bring home most forcefully the total atmosphere of repression which exists. Leflore County is not some faraway place. some alien culture. some backward society. It is part of the United States of America. and all Americans are. in a sense. responsible for what goes on there. These events and actions demonstrate that there are States wrongs as well as States rights. and it is just such wrongs that this bill is directed against. We are a union of people as well as States and no American can stand idly by in the face of a calculated campaign in any part of our Nation to deny a substantial group of citizens their rights under the Federal Constitution.

630125430,S,19140123,256,Mr. MARTINE of New Jersey,Unknown,MARTINE,New Jersey,M,2241,2344,01231914.txt,5979,385,63069481,MARTINE,JAMES,S,NJ,M,D,,voting,"Mr. President. it is with gratification. at least to myself. that I announce that I shall vote for the passage of the pending bill. For many years. both by pen and by voice. I have advocated measures of this character. A few years ago advocates of this policy and of kindred policies were termed dreamers with illbalanced minds and like terms. but it remained until this day for the Senator from North Dakota [Mr. McCuBInER1 to endeavor to arraign those who advocate Government ownership as socialists. Why. Mr. President. seine of our friends do not seem to have realized that this world has moved in the last 25 years. Te arguments used by the Senator from North Dakota today are the same threadbare arguments that were heard 25 years ago. Danger of the Government going into business! Why. Mr. President. this Government is in business now in a hundred ways. all to the advantage and the blessing of the people. All the arguments used against the passage of this bill can be used. and were used. against the establishment of the Postal System. they were used against the parcel post. they were used against tl construction of the Panama Canal and the great irrigation projects built by our Government. I hold that it is not only tile right but that it is the duty of our Government to conserve and control the question of transportation and also to mine the great deposits of coal In our country for the use of the whole people. The Senator from North Dakota. however. said a day or two ago that Governnent ownership of railroads meant ultimately the Government working the coal deposits. God knows I mast devoutly pray for that result. T feel that a repetition of the late unhappy strife in the coal fields of West Virginia can only be averted by such action on the part of the Government. It is well established in many instances that the owners of the coal nilines and the railroad companies are in collusion in fomenting strikes and disturbances for their own profit. as was the result in the anthracite region of Pennsylvania a few years ago. when the price of coal was forced up to $12. $15. and even to $18 a ton. yet at that very time great pyramids of coal fairly lined the railroads reaching Into the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. for which the railroad companies demanded the most extortionate rates. as high as $12. $15. and $18 a ton. Mr. President. I insist that Government ownership of those deposits the land over and the control of the great means of transportation is the only solution of this problem. It is asserted that the employees would be a powerful political arm of the party in power. Possibly so. but I feel that no Senator today will charge that the great number of letter carriers are a serious menace or danger to our country or to our liberties. Let us have a secret ballotone absolutely secretand I care not how many emlployees the Government may have on its pay roll. Mr. President. I feel that there is another sile to this question. which is the humanitarian side. We pass laws regulating and safeguarding the lives of miners. and yet the fact is that. under private ownership. last year there were 1.141 miners lives. which were the toll given to private ownership. A political power. you tell me! Why. Mr. President. the railroads of this country today are contrlled by private ownership. and it is safe to say that every one of them is in politics up to its very eyes. I know how it was in my State. Private ownership of railroads led to scandals. until we were known not as the Commonwealth of New Jersey. but "" the State of Camden and Amboy."" the natural and legitimate legatee of the Camden & Amboy Railroad of the great Pennsylvania Railroad. In my State the Delaware. Lackawanna & Western Railroad. the New Jersey Central. and the Reading were up to their eyes in politics. For 25 years of my life I have come in close contact with their opposition in instances where I have been a candidate or where our party has presented a candidate for office. We were met by. in the first instance. and had to combat with the powers of the great railroad corporations. It was the common thing to ask. ""How does he stand with us?"" Let me say for myself that 35 years ago. when a candidate for the lower house of the Legislature of the Commonwealth of New Jersey. I was asked by one of the great railroad corporations from their office in New York. on Liberty Street. to come .there. I was young then. They wanted to talk with me. I went. I will not mention the mans name who was then the head of that great railroad. He is now dead. His first question to ine was. ""Young man. how do you stand for our legislation? "" I said to himand I ain proud to rehearse it today-"" I want to be elected. I realize the potency and force of your great corporation. For all things that are decent. fair. and honorable I will be an advocate. but for you to own me and carry me around is your chattel. never. so help me Heaven."" Sufficient to say. I was defeated in that and in Many other battles. The same railroad powers confronted us in nearly all our political contests. So that the railroads today are as much a power under socalled private ownership as they can possibly beunder Government ownership. I heard my friend from North Dakota brand us as Socialists. Webster says popular usage of that term is to indicate lawlessness and revolutionary means. What. Mr. President. I ask has the Senator to say with the definition in mind of the looting. l1undering. and robbing of the New Haven Railroad? That has been done under private monopoly. not under public control or public ownership. I vote for this measure because I believe in the principle it embodies. Whether or not it will pay does not worry me a particle. I simply want that it shall benefit the country and advance the general wellbeing of our people. Whether it shall pay or not. it will bring a better day. a brighter dawn. clener progress. and better advantages to those who may come after us.\n'",gratification least announce vote passage pende bill many year pen voice advocate measure character few year advocate policy kindre policy term dreamer illbalance mind term remain day endeavor arraign advocate ownership socialist seine friend seem realize world move last year te argument use today same threadbare argument hear year go business business way advantage blessing people argument use passage bill use use establishment use parcel_post use tl construction great irrigation project build hold tile duty conserve control question transportation mine great deposit coal country use whole people say day ownership railroad mean work coal deposit know mast pray result t feel repetition late unhappy strife coal field avert such action part establish many instance owner coal niline railroad company collusion foment strike disturbance own profit result anthracite_region few year price coal force ton very time great pyramid coal line railroad reach railroad company demand extortionate rate high ton insist government ownership deposit land control great mean transportation only solution problem assert employee powerful political arm party power feel today charge great number letter carrier serious menace danger country liberty let secret ballotone care many emlployee pay roll feel sile question humanitarian side pass law regulate safeguard life miner fact private ownership last year miner life toll give private ownership political power tell railroad country today contrlle private ownership safe say politic very eye know private ownership railroad lead scandal know natural legitimate legatee great reading eye politic year life come close contact opposition instance candidate party present candidate office meet first instance combat power great railroad corporation common thing ask stand let say year candidate low house ask great railroad corporation office come young want talk go mention name head great railroad dead first question ine young man stand legislation say himand ain proud rehearse want elect realize potency force great corporation thing decent fair honorable advocate own carry chattel help sufficient say defeat many other battle same railroad power confront political contest railroad today much power socalled private ownership beunder ownership hear friend brand say popular usage term indicate lawlessness revolutionary mean ask say definition mind looting l1undering robbing do private monopoly public control public ownership vote measure believe principle embody pay worry particle want benefit country advance general wellbeing people pay bring well day bright dawn clener well advantage come us.\n,63.0,bound,0,1

This will be my last speech of the year. As I said yesterday in another speech. it has been an extraordinary honor and privilege to serve in the Senate. I look forward to the next 5 years of doing that. God willing. It is a phenomenal institution and I am proud to be a part of it. even though some days make you scratch your head. I am here on two things before we close out the year. I have a specific interest on items that impact the Western Hemisphere. I wish to take this opportunity to say that one of the real treats of the last year is being able to work with Senator MENENDEZ on the Western Hemispheric Committee. We share a lot of views in common. and even on the ones we dont we have a very cooperative working relationship. It has been a great experience working with him on that. and I look forward to more of that next year on that committee and with everyone on Foreign Relations. I know there are a lot of big domestic issues happening. but the things around the world matter. They matter a lot to us. I know when times are tough economically. sometimes we wonder: Why should we care what is happening halfway around the world? We are not Luxembourg. with all due respect to Luxembourg. We are the United States of America. What that means is that virtually every aspect of our life is directly impacted by things that are happening sometimes halfway around the world. One of the things that is always in our interest is the promotion of freedom and democracy. It is one of the things that sets us apart from other nations. Our greatest export is the American example. the fact that people look to this country and see it is possible for people to have selfgovernment. I know selfgovernment and this Republic sometimes look messy from the outside looking in. As I tell people often. if you saw the way some of your food is made. you wouldnt eat it. I think sometimes when you look at the political process and the lights that shine on it. there are some things about it and the process that I dont like and you dont like. But it is still better than virtually any other form of government that has ever existed on the Earth. We are all privileged and blessed to be able to live in this Republic. Any time we have the opportunity to speak out on behalf of democracy and freedom. we should. I had. this week. the opportunity to engage on that issue. and I wish to publicly acknowledge the work of Under Secretary Sherman. who has spent a lot of time talking to me this week about Nicaragua and about elections in Nicaragua that were. in my opinion. fraudulent and unfortunate because the rest of the hemisphere is moving toward democracy. the rest of the hemisphere is moving toward free and fair elections. In Latin America. sometimes people whom we dont agree with win elections. people who dont like us. who believe the national interests of their country are contrary to ours. But the people chose them. Unfortunately. what happened in Nicaragua is grotesque. This person Daniel Ortega. who was a Sandinista. who was once a dictator of that country. basically has ignored the Constitution and ran for office again. There were extraordinary irregularities. The Carter Center. for example. wasnt allowed to come in and observe it. The OAS has already talked about real problems with that election and we hope to see their report soon. Let me publicly acknowledge the time and effort the Department of State spent talking to me on the phone about ensuring that the United States is a forceful voice on behalf of democracy and freedom in Nicaragua and in the hemisphere. I appreciate their work on that behalf. and I know we are looking forward to the OASs report fairly soon. Senator MENENDEZ and I have filed a resolution in this institution that I hope we will pass that recognizes the need for this country to stand firmly on the side of the Nicaraguan people on behalf of freedom and democracy. There is another topic I touched upon the other day. that is. the peopletopeople travel to Cuba. I kind of went through these itineraries a couple days ago that show basically what these trips are all about is nothing more than tourismjust tourism. It is just people going to Cuba. The reason why this is problematic is because it gives money to the Castro government. Today in the Miami Herald is a very disturbing article. The article is from Juan Tamayo. who is a reporter who writes for the El Nuevo Herald and Miami Herald: Cuban dissidents have sent out photos and videos of a large police crackdown in the eastern town of Palma Soriano that left at least five government opponents with head wounds. black eyes and other injuries. One photo of the Dec. 2 roundup of 46 dissidents shows Henry Perales with two wounds on his shaved head that required nine stitches to close. Another shows AbrahanCQ Cabrera with one stitch on his forehead. ""That wound bled a lot because it was on a blood vessel. but it was a kick to the ribs on the right side that made me fall to the ground .... It still hurts."" Cabrera told El Nuevo Herald by phone from Palma Soriano. The images were sent to the newspaper by Luis Enrique Ferrer Garcia. U.S. representative of the dissident Cuban Patriotic Union. His brother. former political prisoner Jose Daniel Ferrer Garcia. heads the Union and was one of the men arrested in the Palma Soriano crackdown. Union members and supporters took two weeks to smuggle out the photos and the videos. via emails. because they had to work slowly and carefully to avoid police agents who were trying to find and seize the images. Luis Enrique said. The Palma Soriano roundup was one of the largest and harshest police crackdowns on dissidents in recent years. All were freed hours or days later one of them 12 days later without charges. Fortysix men had gathered in a Palma Soriano house starting on Nov. 30 with plans to stage a street protest two days later to demand the release of all political prisoners and respect for human rights. Those sound like pretty reasonable requests to me. release of political prisoners and respect of human rights. This is what they were going to protest on behalf of. Cell phone videos shot inside the house showed many of the dissidents saying they wanted to show they were not U.S. paid ""mercenaries."" as the government brands them. but rather ""defenders of human rights."" The unidentified narrator of some of the videos referred to the police already deployed outside ""and the repression that awaits us."" So these protesters knew what was about to happen. They have seen this before. This is what happens in Cuba when you speak out in favor of human rights and against political prisoners. You get your head cracked open. These guys knew this was going to happen. but yet they had the bravery to go forward with it. Police indeed arrested the dissidents as they left the house in groups of four and five. and a video taken from a secondstory balcony showed them punching some of the protesters and forcing them onto a U.S.-styled yellow school bus parked at the end of the block. Cabrera said the bus driver. dressed in civilian clothes. hit him as well as Perales and several other dissidents with a wrench once inside the bus. The bus driver hit them with a wrench once they got inside the bus. Other photos show dissidents Misael Valdes Diaz and Alexis Yanch OiCQ with black eyes and Emilio Dinza with a large bump on his forehead. Other dissidents reported black and blues from police strikes. Angel Moya. a former political prisoner who was reported beaten in a police station after his arrest in Palma Soriano Dec. 2. said police punched him on the way from the house to the school bus but not afterwards. How nice of them not to punch him afterwards. Moya said Friday that he spent 12 days in a police lockup. in a cell that was smelly and had no water or lights and that he shared with common criminals. This is Cuba. I doubt this experience is something these tourists traveling on U.S. licenses are going to get to see on their next visit to Cuba. The other day I talked about one of these visits that the United States has licensed called Ethics and the Cuban Revolution. How interestingEthics and the Cuban Revolution. I wonder if part of that ethics course will be a part about schoolbus drivers dressed as civilians hitting protesters with a wrench. I wonder if that is part of their itinerary. I wonder if the part about cracking peoples heads open because they are going to peacefully protest in the street is part of the itinerary in this Ethics and the Cuban Revolution. Why do I bring this up again? No. 1. it is outrageous. It should be denounced. and this is a great forum to do it because the world needs to know what happens 90 miles from our shores. It is one of the most repressive regimes in the Western Hemispheres history. It is still in place. It is still ongoing. But here is No. 2. Where do they get the money to pay these people? Dont you think those guys are getting paid. the civilian busdriver is getting paid to hit people with a wrench or do you think he is doing it for free? How are they paying these police officers? How do you get people to do this stuff? You have to pay them. Where do they get their money to pay them? Their government is a fiasco. They dont know anything about the economy. Do you want to know why the Cuban economy is in the tank? It is because the people who run Cuba are incompetent. They have no idea about what a modern economy looks like or how to create one. apart from the fact that they cling to a broken ideology. So where do they get the money to pay for all these things? Sadly. where they are getting a lot of the money to pay for these things is from us. It is from people who live in this country who are curious about what happens in Cuba. who are curiousand some who outright sympathize with this idea that somehow Cuba is this socialist paradiseand they travel there and they leave money there. All these trips. Cuba gets a huge take. and they use it to fund this repressive apparatus. As I said the other day. I understand and I dont have any false illusions that the President is going to change his travel policy toward Cuba or this peopletopeople program. But at least make sure these programs are furthering what you say you are trying to further. which is bringing freedom and democracy to Cuba. instead of being a source of hard currency and hard revenue. A few days ago. I denounced two specific itineraries. I didnt denounce 5 or 10. I pointed out 2 of the most outrageous ones on this floor in a speech I gave. Then I sent that to the State Department and said: Would you look at this for me? They responded that they would. They told me they would send me a letter. In fact. in conversations I had. they gave me great hope that in fact they too were troubled by these itineraries and that they would start to look at these more seriously. Sadly. as a result of what they told mebecause one of the things that has been going on around here is I had placed a hold on two nominations in the Western Hemisphere as a result of their inaction on this issue. After I spoke to them on the phone. I was hopeful about it and I lifted those holds. We were going to vote on those today. Then I got this letter today that. to summarize. basically says: Thank you for your letter. but we cant talk to you about it. That is not what I expected to get. and so we are going to hold those nominations again until we take this seriously. This is a problem. This is a problem. We have these companies in America that are advertising tourism to Cubatourism that is not just a source of irritation. it is a source of hard currency. It is the money this regime is using to crack peoples heads. to pay socalled busdrivers to beat people with wrenches. It is the money they are using to stick people in jails with common criminals. with no access to food or water for 12 days. without charges. We are funding a repressive regime through these practices. and it has to stop. Someone better take this seriously. When they take this seriously. then we can talk. I hope where we are headed here in the coming year is that we will stand not just on the side of the Cuban peoples desire for freedom and democracyno political prisoners. respect for human rightsbut stand for that in the hemisphere and the world. because our voice still matters. and I hope this country will always stand firm on those issues. Before I left today. I wanted to stand on the floor and talk about this because it is something very important to me and should be important to our country. I hope in the coming year we will have the opportunity in our Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere and in this body and in our conversations with the White House and State Department to bring these programs into focus. This peopletopeople program is a sham. Maybe they are very well intentioned but some of these trips are nothing more than tourism that plows millions of dollars into the hands of one of the most disgusting and grotesque. repressive apparatuses this hemisphere has ever seen. and it has to stop. Someone has to start cracking down on these people. someone has to start cracking down on these agencies. someone has to start cracking down on these trips. and make sure they do what they are intended to do. and that is real access to the ways of freedom. to the ways of opportunity. to opening the eyes of the Cuban people to the fact that the rest of the world does not live under what they live undereven though most of the Cuban people already know that. It is time we start holding these people accountable. If they are filing these licenses under false pretenses. they need to be prosecuted. their licenses need to be suspended. They have to be barred from having these trips. We have to have people actively monitoring these itineraries that are being sold. We need to match their applications for these licenses. and we need to stop approving licenses for these tourist trips. I hope we will make progress on that in 2012 and I hope that is what we will focus on in the year to come. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n'",pleasure last speech year say yesterday speech extraordinary honor privilege serve look next year do willing phenomenal institution proud part day make

890209997,H,19660511,37,Mr. HALL,Unknown,HALL,Unknown,M,1099,1161,05111966.txt,2299,157,89101430,HALL,DURWARD,H,MO,M,R,7.0,voting,Mr. Chairman. I rise in support of these amendments. First. I am particularly interested in that portion which will provide better outservice care to dependents of the active duty uniformed personnel. There have been many occasions arising wherein the mother of several dependents. with the husband overseas. has had to travel an undue distance in order to receive prescription servicefor corrective measures for Vision- -or be it for drugs or other things. This is expensive and often requires hiring a car. and/or babysitters. This will take care of this according to the original intent of the true medicare bill. This is the true medicare bill before the name was purloined for the general hospital care of the elderly or the aging. over 65 under the social security tax. It has worked beautifully. and has well demonstratedwith the Army as the action agency for the Department of Defensethe complete cooperation of organized medicine and ancillary agencies of health with Government services. Second. I am of course. Mr. Chairman. vitally interested in that portion that guarantees the departmental care on a spaceavailable basis. and under the new civilian medicare for the aged. now the law of the land. which goes into effect July 1. 1966and other portions properly implemented by January 1967for retirees and their dependents. This is a bill for equity and justice in the best known medical care. such as the people of America demand based on both moral and legal obligations. for those who have served our country so long and honorably. It is a benefit that a grateful Nation gives to its People who have served with devotion and dedication in times of war and in times of peace in the armed services. The third portion of the bill pertains to the care of medically handicapped dependents of those now on active duty in the uniformed services. It is really as important as the others. but I personally have had more experience in the previously discussed fields.

860099812,S,19590724,65,Mr. NEUBERGER,Unknown,NEUBERGER,Unknown,M,5321,5514,07241959.txt,6332,467,86095161,NEUBERGER,RICHARD,S,OR,M,D,,voting,"Mr. President. shortly I hope that the Senate will be taking up Senate bill 812 to create a Youth Conservation Corps. This bill draws upon the experience of the Civil. ian Conservation Corps. I am disappointed that the Secretaries of Agriculture and Interior. our two basic conservation Departments. are opposed to this billas in fact is the Eisenhower administration. The Department of Agriculture says we do not need the corps now. The Department of Interior says that the acceleration of existing conservation programs is neither necessary nor desirable. These are disturbing views. especially when measured against the known conservation needs of our Nation. It becomes increasingly difficult to understand the rationale of an administration which simply declares that we cannot make the sacrifices necessary to pass on to the future a resource on which we have repaired the ravages of the past. I devoutly believe we can do this. The bill the Labor and Public Welfare Committee has reported permits the recreation of the CCC program on a gradually increasing. soundly conceived basis. Today I wish to outline for the Senate a few of the accomplishments of the old CCC program and to define what I believe are the signal conservation contributions that the Youth Conservation Corps can make. During its history the CCC boys made this record: First. Planted 2 billion trees. Second. Did rodent and predator control work on 40 million acres. Third. Treated 21 million acres for tree and plant diseases and insect pest control. Fourth. Pruned. thinned. and otherwise improved 4 million forested acres. Fifth. Spent 6 million mandays on fireprevention work. Sixth. Spent 6 million mandays putting out forest and range fires. Seventh. Constructed 6 million erosion check dams. Eighth. Developed 24.000 new water holes for livestock on the range. Ninth. Constructed 82.000 miles of livestock range fence. Tenth. Put 85.000 miles of telephone lines through the forest. Eleventh. Aided in constructing 122.000 miles of minor protection roads and trails plus 38.000 small bridges. Twelfth. Constructed numerous public forest campgrounds with rustic picnic tables. fireplaces. sanitary facilities. water and swimming facilities. This is a record of real accomplishment. but it only did part of the conservation job. In addition. the paucity of appropriations during the war years permitted many of these sound investments to deteriorate due to lack of maintenance. In the case of others time and use has taken its toll. The accomplishments of the past are typical of the work that still needs to be done. This list of jobs gives an idea of the range and real conservation needs. I do not desire to have this listing be interpreted as a priority list. First. Plant 4 billion trees. Second. Thin young forest stands to improve growth. Third. Clean up old logging slash. Fourth. Remove logging debris from clogged streams. Fifth. Construct small erosion check dams in the headwaters of streams. Sixth. Check sheet erosion and stabilize forest road cuts. Seventh. Engage in fire prevention work. Eighth. Serve on firefighting crews. Ninth. Help control white pine blister rust and other forest and insect pests and diseases. Tenth. Revegetate and restore overgrazed range land. Eleventh. Construct range fences. Twelfth. Construct stub watering facilities. Thirteenth. Improve wildlife habitat. Fourteenth. Construct forest trails. Fifteenth. Construct telephone lines. Sixteenth. Construct waterholes in forest areas to provide firefighting water supplies. Seventeenth. Assist In land surveys and boundary marking on public lands. Eighteenth. Develop recreational facilities for outdoor recreation: (a) Picnic areas. (b) tables. (c) fireplaces. (d) drinking water. (e) sanitary facilities. (f) swimming and boating opportunities. (g) simple shelters. (h) parking and trailer facilities. I submit that each and every one of these jobs is a conservation job which needs to be done. I ask any who wish to speak in opposition to this bill to define any one of these conservation jobs that is unnecessary. If anyone can successfully do so I. for one. will join with him in seeking a floor amendment to vote on whether this work is of the ""leaf raking"" type. I point out that each and every job is one now being done in various but sometimes extremely limited amounts on our forests. parks and public lands. If the work is not essential perhaps we will want to consider eliminating it from the regular programs of our conservation agencies. Mr. President. I have studied the hearings on the Youth Conservation Corps. Except for administration opposition. the testimony is virtually unanimously in favor of it. What. then. leads the administration to oppose this legislation? At a charitable best. I can only conclude that their position reflects a difference over the quantity of conservation work which should be done on publicly owned lands. The bill provides that the number of enrollees shall not exceed 50.000 in the first year. 100.000 in the second year. and 150.000 in the third year. Certainly. then. it cannot be argued that there is a floor on the number of enrollees and that 50.000 is a first year minimum. It is the maximum. The administration can start out with 10.000 boys if it wants. or even 1.000 boys. It can invite the States to submit estimates of the number of boys it can productively use on State lands and thereby provide the benefits to 50.000 boys at the cost of putting 25.000 on Federal land. This bill not only permits conservation work to go forward but as its title suggestsyouth conservation to be promoted. The bill is flexible as to the level of enrollment thus the cost can be tailored to the most exacting budgetary criteria. As an initial cosponsor of this bill I commend the Labor and Welfare Committee and in particular the Senator from Alabama . and the Senator from West Virginia for the constructive and. if I may say. with all the meaning of this wordthe conservative job they have done. With this bill they have given the administration an opportunity to reflect on better ways to meet problems we face as a Nation. I hope when the bill is before us--and when the bill reaches the Presidentthose who now are in opposition will reflect and consider what the Congress has done to improve on a good idea.\n'",hope take bill create bill draw experience disappoint basic conservation department oppose billa fact administration say need corps say acceleration exist conservation program necessary desirable disturb view measure know conservation need nation become difficult understand rationale administration declare make sacrifice necessary pass future resource repair ravage past believe bill report permit recreation program increase conceive basis today wish outline few accomplishment old program define believe signal conservation contribution make history boy make record plant tree rodent predator control work acre third treat acre tree plant disease insect_pest control fourth thin improve forested acre spend manday fireprevention work sixth spend manday put forest range fire seventh construct erosion check dam develop new water hole livestock range ninth construct mile livestock range fence tenth put mile telephone line forest eleventh aid construct mile minor protection road_trail small bridge construct numerous public forest campground_rustic picnic table fireplace sanitary facility water swimming facility record real accomplishment part conservation job addition paucity appropriation war year permit many sound investment deteriorate lack maintenance case other time use take toll accomplishment past typical work need do list job give idea range real conservation need desire listing interpret priority list plant tree thin young forest stand improve growth clean old log slash fourth remove log debris_clogged stream construct small erosion check dam headwater_stream sixth check sheet erosion stabilize forest road cut seventh fire prevention work eighth serve firefighting crew ninth help control white blister_rust other forest insect_pest disease tenth revegetate restore_overgrazed range land eleventh construct range fence twelfth construct stub watering facility thirteenth improve wildlife_habitat fourteenth construct forest trail construct telephone line construct waterhole forest area provide firefighting water supply seventeenth land survey boundary mark public land develop recreational_facility outdoor_recreation picnic area table c fireplace drinking_water e sanitary facility swimming_boat opportunity simple shelter h parking trailer facility submit job conservation job need do ask wish speak opposition bill define conservation job unnecessary join seek floor amendment vote work leaf_rake type point job do various limited amount forest park public land work essential want consider eliminate regular program conservation agency study hearing administration opposition testimony favor lead administration oppose legislation charitable good conclude position reflect difference quantity conservation work do own land bill provide number enrollee exceed first year second year third year argue floor number enrollee first year minimum maximum administration start boy want boy invite submit estimate number boy use land provide benefit boy cost put federal land bill permit conservation work go title suggestsyouth conservation promote bill flexible level enrollment cost tailor exacting budgetary criterion initial cosponsor bill commend particular constructive say meaning wordthe conservative job do bill give administration opportunity reflect well way meet problem face nation hope bill bill reach opposition reflect consider do improve good idea.\n,86.0,bound,0,1

For those of my colleagues who are not familiar with the Board. this body was established in 1897 to make certain that impure and unwholesome tea products were not imported into the United States. The Board. which sets standards for Imported tea. is composed of a panel of outside experts. and is staffed by three Food and Drug Administration employees. There is absolutely no controversy over the function of the Board. the only concern that has been expressed is over Federal support for the Board. At present. the Board receives an appropriation of $130.000. and industry contributes $70.000 in user fees. The legislation I am introducing today provides for total industry support of the Board of Tea Experts through a fee on imported tea or tea merchandise.

MissisWDpi. and Missouri Basins. and not .. h the Bureau of Reclamation. which by definition includes only Western States. Additionally. we had problems such as the Senator from Vermont described. We need coal ports. The Senator from West Virginia I know cares about coal ports. We have spent 5 or 6 years working on this matter of deep water. 55foot ports for export of coal. There are three major coal exporters in the world: Australia. South Africa. and the United States. Europe and Japanmajor importershave built 60foot harbors for super colliers. Australia and South Africa have done the same. .Surprisingly enough. I discovered -that we built one in Seward. Alaska. This Alaskan port is being used by super colliers designed to go back and forth from Japan under 30year contracts. Under the system we had in placehere I am going to revise an estimate of the Senator from Vermont. and I have given long and serious attention to thIsI think by the year 2020 we would have had 15 60foot ports. But that would be too late. That Is 35 years from now. What we need is three in the 1980s. and maybe one in the 1990s. We have gotten one in. Alaska now. We can only build projects of this magnitude If we have projects that meet market tests. If we want nothing. nothing is what we are getting now. If we want nothing we should plod along as in past years. We found we can get nothing very readily. For example. take the case of Lock and Dam 26. There was no problem not to get that done. We need to expand it. obviously. The cost of expanding it in 10 years will be twice what we can do today with timediscounted money. So we have put in cost sharing along with a market test to determine if these projects should go forward. As I noted earlier in this debate. last year. in 1985. the Corps of Engineers did more construction work in Saudi Arabia than it did in the United States. So we put in the costsharing provision. but with respect to flood control. Thereare very few big harbors that cannot afford to pay the costsharing on port projects. If they cannot pay. then they can do without a 60foot harbor. But floods can rush down the tiny hollows in my part of New York State. which is part of Appalachia and geographically part of the Appalachian Regional Commission. This is where I live. and have lived for a quarter of a century. We know what the floods are like In those hollows. They can hit and devastate .communities just like they can in Vermont.

Some of the problems. such as the frozen Chesapeake Bay which has put watermen in my district out of work. are natural disasters which could not have been avoided save by the providence of the Almighty. The other critical problem is the shortage of natural gas. This is not a natural disaster but a manmade problem. the result of Government policy. Most particularly the result of poor judgment by this Congress. The small businessmen forced to close. the millions of workers forced off the job and the school closings are due to a shortage of natural gas caused by a Government mandated price structure which we as a legislative body have refused to decontrol several times in the last 3 years. For a family that must begin living off its savings because Government policy has forced factory shutdowns or a small businessman who must shut down his shop or a home that may be left without heat. it must be difficult to understand why this has happened. But indeed this Congress is responsible for the policy that put those people out of work. Good people of both parties in this House have tried to end the control policies that have brought this crisis and in the process to help formulate a rational energy policy for the Nation. Time and again these good people have been stopped by the legislative and parliamentary acts of those who favor Government control at the expense of longrange policy and human liberty. Again today we face the prospect of ignoring a solution to the energy crisis by firmly pasting bandaids on the wound and praying for warm weather. Rather than abdicate our. responsibility once again. let us examine the problem. do what we can to heal the wound. and provide a longrange policy which will save Americans from the pain of another Governmentcaused natural gas crisis next winter. President Carter has suggested an emergency measure to reallocate the shortages and. if reports hold true. increase by no more than 2 percent the natural gas available for interstate pipelines. Granted. it is necessary for the new administration to take a high profile during this early crisis. but in addition to helping the administration cope with the problem Congress created. we ought to dedicate ourselves to a permanent solution to the problem. It was 1 year ago this week that the House chose political opportunism instead of an energy policy. Passing the Smith amendment was a vote to continue our headlong pursuit of a natural gas shortage. The facts were clearly put before the House last year and now this wrongheaded policy has reached its fruition in crisis proportions. Nobel laureate. Dr. Milton Friedman. explains how the policy works: Economists may not know much. But we do know one thing very well: how to produce shortages and surpluses. Do you want to produce a shortage of any product? Simply have government fix and enforce a legal maximum price on the product which is less than the price that otherwise would prevail. This bit of economic illiteracy that we call natural gas regulation was confirmed by the Supreme Court in 1954. It was determined that controls on the price of natural gas were legal. This was reaffirmed by the Supreme Court in 1968. when the interstate price regulations of the FPC were upheld. The experts were quick to predict the future under such rigid controls. Back in 1969. the FPCs own staff issued a report warning that on a nationwide basis. the ratio of natural gas reserves to production. which then stood at 14.6less than a 15year supply. or roughly twothirds what it was in the midfifties. when the Supreme Court ordered the agency to regulate natural gas priceswould decline to 10.2 by the end of 1973. If anything the reserve to production ratio has fallen even faster. The reasons for this trend are obvious to anyone with an ounce of economic sense. As natural gas becomes more difficult to find and thus expensive to produce. if businessmen are unable to make a profit because of price controls.. they will only take a risk on the exploration for and production of that gas which is profitable. This is no nefarious scheme. but simply the free market system at work. Those politicians who attribute evil intentions to the businessmen might do well to contemplate their own purpose. Business. unlike government. cannot operate as a leech on society. It must produce a profit or it will perish. Private business has no printing machine to paper over its losses. The facts are clear: In 1961 it cost $17.60 per foot to drill for natural gas. today it costs $34.11. Because of inflation and because wells must go deeper to get to oil and gas. and because they make fewer strikes. the result has been that completed costs of a well have skyrocketed. In 1971. a well cost $116.000. 3 years later it cost $189.000. Contrast the shortage of controlledprice interstate gas with the supply of marketpriced intrastate gas. The Carter emergency program is based on this undeniable economic fact: If a profit is possible. producers will search for gas. Opponents of adequate gas supply have built up several strawmen which they insist require governmental control of the market. The first argument made is that the consumer must be protected from the increased costs which result from a decontrol of natural gas prices. However. studies conducted by the GAO and the American Enterprise Institute conclude that an initial price increase to the consumer is probable. But deregulation offers the only hope for longrun sufficiency and ultimately only a $30 per year difference in the total gas bill for the homeowner. The alternative is to spend an extra $30 to heat your home or save the money and freeze while temporarily unemployed. Certainly the policy this Congress has continued by its votes has carefully avoided all reference to fact. And it has caused some rather strange and to me inexplicable arrangements. For example. last year while natural gas sold interstate in the United States was held to 52 cents per 1.000 cubic feet. people in the northern tier States paid over $1 per 1.000 cubic feet for Canadian gas in order to retain adequate supplies. The eastern seaboard has solved its problem by increasing its imports of even higher priced Middle East liquefied natural gas. It seems less than prudent to increase our dependency on foreign energy sources because some politician needs a soapbox. Yes. it is a difficult decision to make but the tradeoff is clear. Prices for natural gas may increase after decontrol. But the alternative is loss of ones job. business. schooling and perhaps even the heat in ones home. And millions will continue to suffer. The FPC has done everything within its power to alleviate the crisis caused by Congress. Last summer they raised the price of interstate natural gas to $1.42 per 1.000 cubic feet. Instantly the nogrowth. nojobs bleeding hearts did their part to help bring about the present crisis and took the FPC to court. As the situation stands at the moment. interstate gas can be sold at $1.42. but if someday in the future the court decides it does not approve of this the gas producers will have to refund the money paid for the higher priced gas. Obviously no one will take a risk under those conditions. As this recordcold winter progressed. the FPC removed the $1.42 control price and allowed 60day emergency purchases at higher prices. But they have come to the end of their legal rope. and other emergency measures are needed. President Carters program supposedly is to provide for these. It is necessary that some emergency action be taken to alleviate the immediate suffering. But let us not stop there. Hearings have been held on this question in the past three Congresses. We must now admit that those who came here to warn us of a possible crisis have been proven right. It would behoove this body to put away its political prejudices and do what is right for the Nation. The solution to this problem is deregulation of prices. With the severe drain on natural gas reserves due to the vastly expanded use of gas during this freeze. next years crisis will be worse than this years if prices are not decontrolled. If natural gas producers are to take the costly risks of the search for additional gas. they must be certain that the gas they find can be sold at a market price. Only natural gas deregulation in the form of the KruegerBroyhill bill can provide such assurances and can thus provide a longrange solution to the problem. Mr. Speaker. let us provide for the emergency of the moment. let us encourage conservation. but more importantly let us take the first step toward a rational national energy policy.

I have always felt that this was not the best approach to try to control the Government. The administration of the Department of Agriculture. as I see it. is for the purpose of service to the people. To cut the number of workers but still leave them where they can spend the money I think is not good economy. You cannot continue to reduce the number of employees and then let them spend the money on travel or something else where you do not get anything for the tax dollar. What the limit is as to how far you can reduce I do not know. It has been pointed out there are duplication in the services. These are fixed by law. and you have to follow that law. The cure is in the legislative committees and the Congress in passing different legislation. In 1941 the actual number of employees on the rolls of the Department of Agriculture was 108.000 people. In December 1951 the number was 65.000. Since 1941 we have reduced from 108.000 to 65.000. Last year we had 64.668. In the bill this year we have reduced that to 62.568. This amendment would cut that some more. Somewhere along the line there is a limit.

When a matter of this kind comes up for consideration. it seems that those opposing this remedial legislation appear in the greatest force and the greatest number.

900047401,S,19670427,457,Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware,Unknown,WILLIAMS,Delaware,M,20495,20923,04271967.txt,14966,927,90099801,WILLIAMS,JOHN,S,DE,M,R,,voting,Mr. President. I want the floor in my own right. I am going to propose that the bill be limited to post offices costing not more than $250.000. That would eliminate the leasing authority for all of the big Federal post office buildings which is the area in which we have found abuse. The reason I object to the bill in its present form is that it is unnecessarily expensive to the Government. It must be recognized that these post office buildings are onepurpose buildings. That is made clear in the committee bill and in the committee report. When one builds a onepurpose building and the Government leases it for 30 years the contractor will automaticallyand I would. tooinclude in the rent a sufficient amount to amortize that building and its cost over a 30year period. He has no basis of knowing whether at the end of that time the Government will renew the lease. If the Government does not renew the lease it would be extremely expensive for the owner of the building to convert such a onepurpose building to. let us say. an office building or an apartment house. The Government. on the other hand. knows that the postal facility will be operating 30 years. 60 years. or 100 years from now. and it. as the owner. can amortize the cost over the full life of the building. The Government knows that at the end of 30 years the building will not be worn out. It knows that the building must be maintained over the 30year period and that it will need the facilities after that period. In many of the contracts the Government has written into the contract a provision that it is responsible for not only the rent but also for all costs of maintenance. It is assumed in the contract that the Government will return the building to the owner in good rentable condition. painted. and with all equipment in good shape. Therefore the ownerthe man leasing the property to the Government=would have a good building. fully amortized. to take over at the end of the lease period. I do not think there is any possible way for the Government to lease to advantage one of these $5 million. $10 million. or $20 million buildings. on. say. a 30year basis. It is not practicable. The owner of the building must recover all of his investment during that period of time. According to my tabulationand I want to make sure that I quote the most recent information from the Post Office Department since its figures seem to vary from day to daythe last report from the Post Office Department showed. there were 287 post offices that had been built on a 20- or 30year lease basis at a cost of more than $250.000. The remainder of the post office buildings were built at a cost of less than that figure. I have tried to obtain from the Department a list of all these offices costing $250.000 or over and the rents that are paid. I asked for the cost of the building. who built it. the date of construction. and the basic terms of the lease. and so forth. I have that report and had intended to put that information in the RECORD today. However. when I started to assemble this information I discovered that it does not coincide with the other information I have received as to costs. and so forth. I think it is Indefensible that the Post Office Department does not know the amount of rent it pays for some of the offices. If it does know why do they not give the committee or me the right answer? At the time I asked for the reports I made the suggestion that it would be all right with me if a copy of the reports and the information being sent to me was also sent to the committee. Then we would have the same reports. I cite one example of inconsistency. In the report received by me under date of September 29. 1966. from the Department. the annual rent for the post office at Buffalo. N.Y.. is listed as $683.479. That building is leased for 30 years. I have every right to expect the information to be correct. However. I had a report at the same time from the Comptroller General with reference to the same post office building in Buffalo. According to the report of the Comptroller General the Post Office Department leased the same building from the same man for an annual rent of $958.479.76. How can anyone explain this discrepancy? The Department sent to me and the committee this report which I have here. which indicates that it would require 391t/_. years to recover his investment costs. I assume that the 391/2year period is computed on the basis of the report which accompanied the information. showing that the particular office is being leased by the Government at an annual rent of $683.479. However. the Comptroller General states that the annual rental for this building is $958.479.76 instead of $683.479. Over the 30year period that is around a $9 million difference. Perhaps the Department is computing its rentals on the basis of this new math. if so they had better convert back to the old formula. In fact. I have in my file a letter from the Post Office dated approximately a year earlier wherein the Post Office Department gave $958.479 as the annual rent being paid. Those inconsistencies are indefensible. I have here another example. This information is also contained in the letter which I received from the Post Office Department. The letter is signed by Amos J. Coffman. Acting Assistant Postmaster General. under date of September 28. 1966. In listing the Detroit Post Office the estimated construction cost is given as $22.755.000 and the land cost. $689.000. The total cost is $23.444.000. The annual rent Is $1.801.474 per year. This is the last report. In the Comptroller Generals report on this same office he lists the cost of the facilities at around $15.807.000. However. they did not include in that $15.807.000 certain other costs. such as insurance premiums and general administration expenses. which account for some variation. but those items would not account for a $6 or $8 million variation. I cite those two examples. but there are other errors. I desire to be frank about the matter. I found only three or four examples of such errors since I started to put this report together. but I do not have the Comptroller Generals report on all of them for comparison. But when you find three or four inconsistencies out of about 10 that is a high percentage. When they tell the committee that the building costs $24 million and that the rent was computed on the basis of amortizing it over x period of years and then you find it only cost about $16 million. questions are in order. Somebody does not know what he is talking about. When you find that they report to the committee and to me how economically feasible this proposition is on the basis that they are renting this building for sixhundredandsomethousand dollars when in reality they are paying nine hundred and some thousand dollars. how do we know how to vote on it? I cite another instance where they leased the post office building. This time they awarded a competitive bid contract to build this building on the basis that the man whose bid was accepted was to build the building. furnish all maintenance. the air conditioning. the heating. the lights. and so forth. and keep it painted and in a complete state of repairs. That is the way the bid was accepted. After this building was constructed and the Post Office Department practically ready to move in they negotiated a change in the lease. and the Government assumed 100 percent of the maintenance costs over the entire life of the lease with just a minimal reduction in rent. The Comptroller General audited that change of contract and the estimate was that it would cost the Government $2.800.000 more over the life of the lease than it would have cost if it had kept its original lease. That is indefensible. No one operating his own business would make such a decision. We have any number of examples where they have changed these leases to the disadvantage of the Government. where the extra cost is going to be half a million dollars or $300.000 or $400.000. In nearly every instance when the Comptroller General checked with the Post Office Department the latter stated that the papers with which they negotiated and figured this out were misplaced or lost. In two instances. they said it was done by an unidentified man in the Post Office Department who has left the Department. and they do not know exactly who did it. How do they know he has resigned or retired if they do not know who did it? I quote: The Department advised us that the officials who handled the negotiations were no longer with the Department and apparently no other information is available in POD. These are the words of the Comptroller General. Why do they not know? The Comptroller General has been highly critical of the fact that exceptionally elaborate office space is being built for a postmaster. far more elaborate than he needs. The Comptroller General was very critical of this waste. and I shall read from his reports on some of these offices: When questioned as to the need for providing postmasters with private offices of such size. the Post Office Department officials informed us that a large office is necessary to impress visiting representatives of labor. industry. and public organizations with the importance and dignity of the postmasters position. We respect the postmaster in our town as an individual. not because of the size of his office. Continuing. the Comptroller General points out: Under Post Office Department standards. Postmasters in the top three grades of the postal field service are allowed private offices containing more space than is provided in the Senate and House Office Buildings for private offices of Senators and Representatives. It is nice to impress upon people the importance of postmasters. but I do not believe you enhance a mans importance by putting him in an auditorium. It is just a waste of money. If we are going to impress people in that way. put them in Yankee Stadium. In this program we are pouring millions of dollars down a rat hole. I have not found such abuse in smaller post offices which are being constructed on a lease basis. Perhaps the same problem would be found to exist if the situation were examined. but I have not found it. When a contract is awarded for a post office that is going to cost $100.000 or $200.000 there is a vast number of builders who can compete for that particular building or investors who would like to have it as an investment. There is real competition. But. with respect to these large buildings. if one goes over this list he finds that half a dozen or so groups are building practically all of them. Competition is less keen. Significantly it is in the larger buildings that these expensive change orders and added costs are found. I have cited the change order In the Detroit facility. where. according to the Comptroller General. they upgraded the contract. and over the life of the contract gave $2.800.000 more than had to be paid. They already had the building built and under a cheaper contract. The Comptroller General pointed out a series of cases in this report. but I just cite two of them. I quote from the report: The low bids for annual rental under a 30year lease for one postal facility were $1.884.000 with lessor maintenance and $1.780.000 without maintenance. a difference of $104.000. The Post Office Department estimated that annual Government maintenance cost would be $142.110. I shall not read all of the report. but on the basis of the Post Office Departments estimates of maintenance costs. the changed contract resulted in an additional cost of $19.000 per year. That is $19.110 per year that the Government automatically assumed on a negotiated change in its first contract. As a result the Comptroller General said that over the 30year lease period of this one office the Government will pay out $573.300 more than Is necessary. We find another instance where. after they had built and leased the building some additional parking space was needed. The Government itself negotiated with an adjoining property owner. obtaining an option to purchase this property at $87.441 and made a $10.000 downpayment. The Government turned this option over to the lessor. and the lessor then spent an estimated $30.000 to blacktop and to put in lightinga total cost of $117.000 on this parking lot. After deciding on the purchase price the Government negotiated the lease to pay $10.000 a year on a 30year lease. which means they will pay $300.000 for this parking lot over the 30 years. The man will still own it at the end of the 30 years. This program has reached the stage of ridiculousness. I realize we have a poverty program under this Great Society. but the poor fellows negotiating these contracts upward by millions are not in poverty. Surely we should not be doling the money out with a scoop shovel in $2 or $3 million amounts. I will be willing to go along with this bill if they will accept an amendment limiting it to facilities costing not over $250.000. Let the Government. if it needs a post office. build it on a competitive bid basis and own it. Mr. President. I point out again that these are onepurpose buildings. Their leases on a 20- or 30year basis could not be economically feasible. no matter how the contract is written. I shall cite an example of a onepurpose building. The example is extreme. But suppose we were to take the case of this building. our Nations Capitol. Should It have been constructed and then leased on a 30year term. the full cost would have to be amortized over that period. but we are going to have a Government not just for 30 years. I hope. but for centuries. Whenever there is a onepurpose facility. I do not care how the contract Is negotiated. it Is better for the Government to construct and own the building. The Post Office Department does not have that much money to throw away Let us get some efficiency in this agency. Much has been said about turning the Post Office Into a private corporation and operating it as a business. I am one Senator who does not discount that proposal. It might not be the whole answer. but it does deserve careful consideration. The time is long past when some sensible business arrangements should be put into this massive agency. There is not a business in America that would take a onepurpose plant and put it on a 30year lease. I shall not delay the Senate tonight by referring to any more of these reports. I shall at a later date put them in the RECORD. I am first going to have them rechecked. They should not be printed in the RECORD today with the inconsistencies that exist. I would be willing to permit the Senate to proceed with the bill if we can have an agreement on the amendment to limit this authority to construct on a lease basis post office facilities costing less than $225.000. Based upon the historical record of this program there have been less than 300 such larger offices built over the past 15 years.\n',want floor own right go propose bill limit post_office cost more

Any measure that assumes to meet this situation and assumes to meet it only pending the ratification of the treaty of peace is wholly inadequate and will not answer the purpose. I will not use the word "" camouflage."" but some expression akin to that would well fit this bill. Profiteering will not cease with the ratification of the treaty. it will go on as long as conditions will permit it. We must legislate so as to deal with the situation. We have had a great deal said in the papers. we have had moaning and groaning on the part of this great committee. and now we find that they have brought forth with much acclaim the veritable mouse we read about in the fable. Now. it may be that some gentlemen think that Congress has not the constitutional power to deal with this situation. I had that idea myself at one time in the past. Perhaps if I had the rewriting of the Constitution I would fix it so that Congress would not have the power. but I can not do that. The Constitution is here. As construed by the Supreme Court it gives Congress the power to pass a law that will have effect long enough after the coming of peace to cure this system of profiteering. to remedy the high cost of living. There are several decisions of the court to that effect. I imagine there are a good many gentlemen in the 1louse who hold to the opinion I held until I had investigated the subject. I want to refer those gentlemen to several cases decided by the Supreme Court of the United States. Perhaps the leading case is the case of Steward v. Kahn (11 Wallace. 4V ). where the court undertook to construe a ""stay "" law passed by Congress during the Civil War. It was passed as a war measure and in exercise of the war powers of Congress. By its terms the law had operation for a period after the warafter the war period had passed. The court said. on pag. .506 of the report: The Constitution gives to Congress ihe power to declare war. to raise and support armies and navies. Congress is authorized to make all laws necessary and proper to carry into effect granted lowers. The measures to be taken in carrying oil war and to suppress insurrectionti are not defined. The decision rests fully in the discretion of those to whom the powers involved are confided by the Constitu1ion. In the latter case the power is not limited to victory in the field aind the dispersion of the insurgent forces. ft carries with it the power to guard against the immediate renewal of the conflict and to remedy the evils which have arisen dlurin g its rise and progress. This act falls within the latter category. The i power to pass it Is really implid from its power to make war and suppress itisurrection. It is a beneficent exercise of this authority. The case of The United States r. (Iettysburg Eleetri( Railway Co. (160 U. S.. 668) decided that the act of Congress approved March 3. 1893. reating the military park at (.ettysburg. and the act approved June 4. 1894. granting the power of condemnnation forthe purposes of such park. were valid under the war power of Congress. These acts were passed 28 years after the close of the Civil War. Justice Peckham. for a unanimous court. stated. at page 681: Upon the question whether the proposed use of this land is a public one. we think there can lie no wellfounded doubt. also in oar judgment the Government has the constitutional power to condemn land for the proposed use. * - * Congress has power to declare war and to create and equip armies and navies. It has the great power of taxation to be exercised for the common defense and general welfare. flaving such powers. It has soch other and implied ones as are necessary and appropriate for the purpose of carrying the powers expressly given into effect. Any act of Congress which directly tends to enhance the respect and love of a citizen for the institutions of his country and to quicken and strengthen his motives to defend them. and which is germane to and intimately connected with and appropriate to the exereise of some one or all of the powers granted by Congress. must be valid. This proposed use conies within such description. The provision comes within the rule laid down by Chief Justice Marshall in McCulloch v. Maryland (4 Wheat.. 316). in these words: ""Let the end be legitimate and within the scope of the Constitution. and all mean which are appropriate. which are plainly adequate to that end. which are not prohibited or inconsistent with the letter and spirit of the Consiltation. are constitutional.""

The estimated revenues of the Department for the next fiscal year are $42.741.722.05. leaving a doficicncy to be taken out of the general fund of $787.577.95. It will be observed that this is the lowest deficiency that has been reached in the PostOffice Department for a great number of years. The amount appropriated from the general fund for the current year was $2.571.868. The estimated revenues for the next fiscal year will exceed the estimated revenues for the present year by $3.896.548.05. We are satisfied that the PostmasterGeneral has curtailed the expenses of the Department and of the service throughout the whole country in every possible way in which it could be done. even almost to the extent of crippling the service. and for that reasonwe have in a fewinstances only cut down the estimates which were submitted by the Department. We fully believe. and indeed it seems inevitable. that in the principal items of the bill. making appropriations for the salaries of postmasters. for the railway mail service. and for starroute service. there must be a deficiency which will follow. Hence we have allowed for these several itemsthe full amount estimated. The largest reduction which we have made in any instance was $100.000 which was estimated and submitted by the Department for the purpose of extending the freedelivery system in cities where it does not now exist. We had dohbt about the propriety of this extension. because in nearly all the cities where the system now exists a heavy drain is made upon the Treasury to maintain the service. for the revenue is far below the expenses. hence the estimate of $100.000 for extending the freedelivery system to new cities was not recommended by the committee. but a clause is added to the bill which will permit a reasonable expenditure for that purpose in the discretion of the PostmasterGeneral. We have reduced the estimate for miscellaneous expenses in First Assistants department $10.000. for the reason that some of the expenses which have heretofore been charged to that fund will hereafter be charged to the transportation fund. and we placed in the bill the same amount that was appropriated last year. In making up this bill we cannot fail to see the growing prosperity of the country and take that into consideration. as well. as the steady increase of revenues which results therefrom. As a basis of estimates in providing for the service we will find the increase in the revenues as well as the service is about 10 per cent. per annum. Now. having that in mind. we can readily see why there should be a steady increase in the expense and amounts to be appropriated from year to year. We must recognize the increase and make provision therefor. if we would have the service effectual. In most cases and for the minor items that are submitted in the bill we have allowed the same amounts appropriated for the current year. The principal increase over the appropriation for the current year arises in the larger items. for the railway clerks. ronte agents and messengers. also for postmasters salaries. There were 1.500 mere postmasters at the close of the last fiscal year than in the year 1880. An additional allowance is also made for the carrier system. These are the principal items of increase over the current year which are found in the bill. Wereadily vree that the appropriation made for the present year seemed to be literal when it was made. but it is easy now to be seen that owing to the growth of the service which results from the very prosperous condition of the country there will be deficiencies which will follow the present year. Hence. we have not felt at liberty to reduce these estimates. but have in the main adhered to them and recommended them in this bill. Now. Mr. Chairman. for the information of the committee. I have submitted witli my report and had printed a large number of statistics in detail which every gentleman will find to be useful. Inmost eases I trust these items will bear scrutiny. and that it will be ascertained that the sums named are absolutely necessary if we continue the postal service and expect to make it effectual.\n',bill consideration appropriate less amount estimate estimate revenue next fiscal year leave doficicncy take general fund observe low deficiency reach great number year amount appropriate general fund current year estimate revenue next fiscal year exceed estimate revenue present year satisfied curtail expense service whole country possible way do extent cripple service reasonwe fewinstance cut estimate submit believe seem inevitable principal item bill make appropriation salary postmaster railway_mail service starroute service deficiency follow allow several itemsthe full amount estimate large reduction make instance estimate submit purpose extend freedelivery system city exist dohbt propriety extension city system exist heavy drain make maintain service revenue expense estimate extend freedelivery system new city recommend committee clause add bill permit reasonable expenditure purpose discretion reduce estimate miscellaneous expense department reason expense charge fund charge transportation fund place bill same amount appropriate last year make bill fail see grow prosperity country take consideration steady increase revenue result basis estimate provide service find increase revenue service cent annum have mind see steady increase expense amount appropriate year year recognize increase make provision therefor service effectual most case minor item submit bill allow same amount appropriate current year principal increase appropriation current year arise large item railway clerk ronte agent messenger postmaster salary mere postmaster close last fiscal year year additional allowance make carrier system principal item increase current year find bill vree appropriation make present year seem literal make easy see owe growth service result prosperous condition country deficiency follow present year feel liberty reduce estimate main adhere recommend bill information committee submit report print large number statistic detail gentleman find useful inmost ease trust item bear scrutiny ascertain sum name necessary continue postal service expect make,47.0,bound,1,0

Under existing law we have issued approximately twentyfive and onehalf of the twentyeight billions authorized. leaving approximately two and onehalf billions which still may be issued. Yet only thirteen and onehalf billions worth of these bonds are now outstanding. and practically eleven and onehalf billions have been retired which. under existing law. cannot be replaced. The bill also amends existing law with respect to Treasury notes. certificates. and other forms of Government obligations. Under existing law $20.000.000.000 can be issued in Treasury notes. certificates of indebtedness. bills. and so forth. but the law is so written that not more than $10.000.000.000 can be issued in Treasury notes and $10.000.000.000 in certificates of indebtedness and Treasury bills. The purpose of this is to consolidate these two authorizations. so that if it is to the advantage of the Government to issue more of one form than another. it would have the privilege of doing so. One form of indebtedness is sometimes more favorable at a low rate of interest than another form. and this bill is intended to make the authorization more flexible. and not to increase the amount that may be issued for Treasury notes. bills. and so forth. It is the purpose to consolidate so that at the option of the Government the Treasury Department can issue more of one form than another. The bill also provides for the issuing of a new form of bonds known as "" Government savings bonds ""1. that can be purchased by small investors who wish to invest their earnings in Government securities. These bonds. under the provisions of this bill. may be issued in denominations as low as $25. They are intended ultimately to replace the issuing of Postal Savings bonds. In other words. there are about 88 million dollars of Postal Savings bonds now out. and it is the purpose of the Treasury Department to discontinue issuance of those bonds. and issue these United States savings bonds which may be purchased by people of small means who desire to invest their savings in governmental bonds. At the present time Liberty Loan bonds and other forms of bonds may be used as surety bonds. but bonds issued by the Home Owners Loan Corporation and other forms of bonds are not usable In that way. This bill provides that any bonds. the principal and interest of which are guaranteed by the Government. may be used as surety bonds. If it is necessary for one to give a bond to the Government. and he has these bonds that are not now usable as surety bonds. he will not be forced to go into the market and purchase surety bonds. but can use these bonds in lieu of a bond sold by some bonding company. It is thought the adoption of these amendments will enable the Secretary of the. Treasury to issue the type of securities which. in his judgment. are best suited to meet the conditions of the market and the needs of the Government. In addition it will allow a further refunding of outstanding obligations. There are at the present time some $5.000.000.000 of Liberty bonds bearing high interest rates which could be called in and refunded if the Treasury now had the authorization which is provided in this bill. The benefits that would be derived are best shown by what has been accomplished since January 31. 1933. at which time the annual interest rate on the interestbearing debt was 3.407 percent. whereas on December 31. 1934. the average rate was reduced to 2.96 percent. In other words if the average rate of 3.407 percent on January 31. 1933. had continued up to the present time. the amount of the interest charge would today be approximately $125.000.000 greater than we are now paying.\n'",retire other refund exist law issue twentyfive onehalf twentyeight billion authorize leave onehalf billion issue onehalf billion worth bond outstanding onehalf billion retire exist law replace bill amend exist law respect note certificate other form government obligation exist law issue note certificate_indebtedness bill law write more issue note certificate_indebtedness bill purpose consolidate authorization advantage issue more form privilege do form indebtedness favorable low rate interest form bill intend make authorization flexible increase amount issue note bill purpose consolidate option issue more form bill provide issuing new form bond know government saving bond purchase small investor wish invest earning security bond provision bill issue denomination low intend replace issuing_bond other word dollar bond purpose discontinue issuance bond issue saving bond purchase people small mean desire invest saving governmental bond present time bond other form bond use surety_bond bond issue other form bond usable way bill provide bond principal interest guarantee use surety_bond necessary give bond bond usable surety_bond force go market purchase surety_bond use bond lieu bond sell bond company think adoption amendment enable treasury issue type security judgment suit meet condition market need addition allow further refunding outstanding obligation present time bond bear high interest rate call refund authorization provide bill benefit derive show accomplish time annual interest rate interestbeare_debt percent average rate reduce percent other word average rate percent continue present time amount interest charge today great paying.\n,74.0,bound,0,1

S. 507. This act will provide an overall management policy and authority for the Bureau of Land Management to administer the 448 million acres of federally owned land under its jurisdiction within the Department of Interior. The importance of this act cannot be stressed enough. since those 448 million acres of land comprise roughly 20 percent of Americas land base. and 60 percent of all our federally owned property. This land base includes rangeland. forest land. refuges. and a number of specific resources which are crucial to this Nations economy. recreation. and wellbeing. I intend to offer an amendment to this legislation when it is considered which. if adopted. will insure that full participation is provided in the BLMs landuse planning program. My amendment will specifically require the Secretary of the Interior to coordinate planning of BLM lands with State and local government landuse plans. I believe that landuse planning is best handled by State and local governments. By their very nature. these governments are closer to the people they seek to serve. so that on a daily. ongoing basis. people can communicate with these governments. I am not saying that State and local governments are the cureall to the landuse planning issue. but they are a far sight better than involving the Federal Government in landuse planning in Washington. D.C.. or regional. multiState offices. Therefore. my amendmhent will insure that the numerous plans and landuse patterns which are a product of local citizenry and local communities are fully considered by the Secretary of the Interior through the Bureau of Land Management when he is making decisions on how to administer the wealth of Federal lands which affect the innumerable communities throughout this country. The total acreage of my home State of Oregon. for instance. is made up of 52percent federally owned lands. of which 15.742.154 acres. or roughly 25 percent of the State. is under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Bureau of Land Management. That degree of federally owned lands is so overwhelmingly important to the economic wellbeing and environmental protection of Oregon. or any other State with federally owned lands within its borders. that full public participation is essential. If anything. my amendment will enhance the planning process for Federal lands because it will require consideration of the planning done in local communities by local governments by the local citizenry. If Federal landuse planning or Federal lands are best served by anything. then I believe it is the concerns and desires of that local citizenry.

I regret that I cannot vote for this bill. It has been so amended in specific respects as to not only render parts of it constitutionally questionable. but also make it objectionable as a declaration of policy. The school prayer amendment adopted yesterday. making it an official purpose of the department to permit daily opportunity for voluntary prayer or meditation in public elementary and secondary. schools is. in my view. unconstitutional and has no place in this or any bill. The language clearly runs counter to the first amendment rights which we have traditionally upheld and counted on since the founding of this Nation. The Supreme Court has consistently held that the Government must maintain a neutral position with regard to religion in public schools. Moreover. prayer in public schools is prohibited in the constitution of my own State of Wisconsin. as affirmed by a State Supreme Court decision in 1893. To those who argue that there is no prescribed prayer in this amendment. no coercion. no Government interference. I would make a couple of points. First. it is proclaimed as an official purpose of the Department of Education. That is a Government decree. Second. to the extent that children must be in school and. presumably. must participate in silent prayer when the designated time is set. or not pray if that child so chooses. Government involvement is present under the amendment. Any student. whenever he or she wishes. may voluntarily and silently pray at any time they so choose. The Court did not throw out the concept of an individuals right to pray. The Court simply said that we cannot have Government involvement. Justice Clark. in writing for the majority in Murray against Curlett. Abington School District against Schempp. in 1968 clearly stated the prohibition of the first amendment against any government role in promoting religion. He said: The place of religion in our society is an exalted one achieved through a long tradition of reliance on the home. the church and the inviolable citadel of the individual heart and mind. We have come to recognize through bitter experience that it is not within the power of government to invade that citadel. whether its purpose or effect be to aid or oppose. to advance or retard. In the relationship between man and religion. the state is firmly committed to a position of neutrality. Justice Clark went on to note that it is irrelevant that such practices may seem ""relatively minor encroachments on the first amendment. The breach of neutrality that is today a trickling stream may all too soon become a raging torrent."" Mr. Chairman. this amendment clearly violates the neutrality the Court spoke of. Religion. if it is to have a place in an individuals life. must be promoted by the home. the church. and each individuals own desires. If these traditional sources cannot achieve the kind of religious awareness and commitment some are apparently seeking. it will not be obtained by finding someone else to do the job. It will not be obtained by turning that responsibility over to the schools. Time and time again we have heard many of the same Members who support this amendment say on this floor that the Government has no right to interfere in matters which are the responsibility of the parents. Yet. this amendment runs directly counter to that claim. Further. I was under the impression that opponents of this bill are concerned that the Department will get involved in the decisions traditionally made on the local level. that the department will attempt to influence curricula choices. What. pray tell. do they think this amendment does except get the Federal Government involved in local decisionmaking? It simply has no place in this bill. The school busing amendment is another to which I have the strongest objections. This amendment. which effectively prohibits the Secretary from requiring busing of students or teachers to carry out desegregation as a condition of eligibility for Federal assistance is another in a long line of efforts by certain Members of Congress to undo what have been great strides in the area of school desegregation. While the courts have clearly indicated that busing should not be considered the only remedy for desegregation. they have indicated that busing must be considered a possible remedy. In the unanimous decision of the Supreme Court in Swan against CharlotteMecklenburg Board of Education back in 1970. Chief Justice Burger. writing for the Court. said the Court found ""no basis for holding that the local school authorities may not be required to employ bus transportation as one tool of school desegregation. Desegregation plans cannot be limited to the walkin school."" Yet. by removing busing as a possible remedy. this amendment removes one of the most important symbols of the commitment of the Government to provide an equal education to all of our children. It is regrettable that some have managed to so encumber this bill. Education does deserve the priority creation of a separate department would give it. But. we cannot begin to compromise basic principles in the process. at least I cannot.*\n'",support notion creation separate regret vote bill amend specific respect render part questionable make objectionable declaration policy school prayer amendment adopt yesterday make official purpose department permit daily opportunity voluntary_prayer meditation public elementary_secondary school view unconstitutional place bill language run first amendment right uphold count founding nation hold maintain neutral position regard religion public school prayer public school prohibit constitution own affirm decision argue prescribed prayer amendment coercion interference make couple point proclaim official purpose government decree extent child school participate silent_prayer designate time set pray child choose government involvement present amendment student wish pray time choose throw concept individual right pray say involvement writing majority state prohibition first amendment government role promote religion say place religion society exalted one achieve long tradition reliance home church inviolable_citadel individual heart mind come recognize bitter experience power government invade citadel purpose effect aid oppose advance retard relationship man religion state committed position neutrality go note irrelevant such practice seem minor encroachment first amendment breach neutrality today trickling_stream become rage_torrent amendment violate neutrality speak religion place individual life promote home church individual own desire traditional source achieve kind religious awareness commitment seek obtain find job obtain turn responsibility school time time hear many same member support amendment say floor right interfere matter responsibility parent amendment run counter claim impression opponent bill concerned get involve decision make local level department attempt influence curricula choice think amendment get involve local decisionmaking place bill school bus amendment strong objection amendment prohibit require busing student teacher carry desegregation condition eligibility federal assistance long line effort certain member undo great stride area school_desegregation court indicate bus consider only remedy desegregation indicate bus consider possible remedy unanimous decision write say find basis hold local school authority require employ bus transportation tool school_desegregation desegregation plan limit walkin school remove bus possible remedy amendment remove important symbol commitment provide equal education child regrettable manage encumber bill education deserve priority creation separate department give begin compromise basic principle process cannot.*\n,96.0,bound,0,1

I yield myself such time as I may consume. . Mr. Speaker I rise in support of this legislation. The bill before us contains several important reclamationrelated proposals that deserve our support. I will mention a few of them briefly. This package includes my legislation directing the Interior Secretary to convey a small parcel of the Shoshone Reclamation Project to the Big Horn School District in Wyoming. The legislation was necessary because the school district owns a number of homes on reclamation land that they want to sell. I want to thank Chairman MILLER for considering this important proposal. Mr. STUMP of Arizona has two bills In this package today. The first. S. 1146. ratifies the YavapaiPrescott Indian water rights settlement. The second. H.R. 5025. will allow the city of Page. AZ. to meet water needs during peak use periods in the Summer months by removing a pumping limitation. -I have a statement from Congressman STUMP. that I would like inserted In the RECORD. Congressman McINNIs of Colorado also has two proposals in this legislation. They include H.R. 4525. which authorizes the early payout of the Stagecoach Reservoir project and H.R. 4523. which will allow for private power development at the Mancos project. Mr. McINNis deserves credit for his hard work on both of these measures. I also want to give credit to Congressman LAMAR SMiTH for his hard work in passing H.R. 1474. which increases the acreage limitation at the San Angelo project in Texas. Finally. I rise in strong support of H.R. 4615. which our friend. JIM HANSEN of Utah has worked hard to pass. This bill will enbance the ability of the Central Utah project to implement its water conservation programs throughout the 13 county area this project serves. This will be done by authorizing the Central Utah Water Conservancy District to enter into water storage and carriage agreements to move nonproject water through CUP facilities. The Utah delegation has also worked * to clarify the original legislative Intent of the CUP Completion Act. Under this act. employees and board members of the Central Utah Water Conservancy District were to serve as members of the Utah Reclamation Mitigation and Conservation Commission.

930147786,S,19731126,204,Mr. WILLIAMS,Unknown,WILLIAMS,Unknown,M,14595,14717,11261973.txt,4397,311,93104711,WILLIAMS,HARRISON,S,NJ,M,D,,voting,"I have yielded it back. Mr. TowER. Mr. President. it should be noted that S. 1861 removes the exemption for retail and service establishments that have gross sales under $250.000. but which are part of a chainstore operation. The reasoning for this exemption Is that these stores are vital to their individual communities and that the repeal of the exemption would have the effect of encouraging the chains to consolidate. I do not support the repeal of this exemption. I think that It will further erode the position of small business in our economy. However. my amendment increasing the small business exemption does not strike the chainstore repeal language In the bill. It affects only the gross sales enterprise exemption under section 3 of the act. During last years debate on the amendment to retain the $250.000 exemption by the Senator from Vermont. Mr. STAFFORD. the distinguished chairman of the Labor and Public Welfare Committee. Mr. WrLLIAMS. made the important point that with the inflationary forces at work. the small business gross sales exemption was being reduced without Congress taking any affirmative action on it. On the small business exemption. he made the following point: ""We all know the struggles of small business. for a variety of compelling economic reasons. I have come to the point where I regret some employees will not be covered whom I would like to see covered but. on balance. this is. I believe. a wise answer and is in the best interests of the country."" I think those were words of great sagacity on the part of the Senator from New Jersey. and they are as true today as when he spoke them last. The amendment I have proposed today is consistent with this responsible statement by the distinguished chairman. Taking inflation into mind. the small business gross sales exemption is equivalent to only $193.000 in May 1973 dollars and will be worth only $181.000 by the end of this year. This amendment is designed to assist the momandpop stores in our communities. Unless these small businessmen and businesswomen are given the relief called for in this amendment they will certainly not be able to compete with the much larger enterprises. I do not think the Senate wants to go on record as increasing economic concentration at the expense of the small business community. Mr. President. the principal objections to the minimum wage bill do not come from big business. They come from small businesses. I have not had one big business or big businessman complain to me about the minimum wage. It has always been the small businessman. We are seeking to punish him now by in fact reducing his exemption from the effects of this bill. We talk a great deal about small business. we have all sorts of legislation designed to help small business. We are now getting minorities into the mainstream of American business. through the Office of Minority Business Enterprise. We are punishing these ethnic minorities that are just coming into the mainstream of American business by making them liable to the provisions of this act. So let us just note that in spite of all we are doing for small business. we are engaging in the hypocrisy of reducing their exemption so far as the applications of this minimum wage bill are concerned. Believe me. it is going to result in unemployment. I have already seen it happen with previous minimum wage legislation. Small businesses are going to close. more people are going to be unemployed. There seems to be somewhat of a relationship between the minimum wage in various sections of the country and the unemployment rate. The minimum wage in New York is $1.85. in Texas. it is $1.40. We have 2 percent less unemployment In Texas than In New York. Of course. the cost of living is much lower in Texas. and the people who make these lower wages probably live as well as the people who make higher wages in the more congested areas of the country.

The implication of the arguments against the Hoeven substitute is that the only way to correct the existing inequity is to establish a third subsidy in the field of cotton. There is another way to correct this inequity. That is to lower cotton price supports until they are no higher than the world price and the cost of transportation to the mills overseas who are buying our cotton. If we lower price supports to where they are equivalent to the world price plus the freight rate overseas. then we would eliminate the Inequity that now exists.

Of these. a large percentage are limited to ninetenths of an acre. Any allotment less than ninetenths of an acre. requiring practically the same amount of time to cultivate. cure. and market. fails to provide an economic return. I am introducing a bill to provide that no allotment of ninetenths acre or less shall be reduced in any 1 year. The adoption of this provision will assure the farmer of the muchneeded sure cash income upon which he usually depends to meet taxes and other fixed obligations. Again. a great number of small farmers residing in my district. finding employment in nearby industrial plants most profitable. have for some years neglected to use their tobacco allotment. which. after 5 years of nonuse legally reverts to the State acreage allotment. In this period of readjustment of the national economy. some of these rural residents. no longer able to find employment in industry. find it necessary to return to agricultural pursuits for their livelihood. The bill I am introducing would permit these small landowners to recover their former allotments for the cultivation of burley tobacco and would assure them of a small cash crop so essential to this class of farmers. This change in the law would add very little to the total of burley tobacco production. but in case lack of available industrial employment becomes a matter of concern the availability of these small tobacco tracts may mean the difference between selfsubsistence and public assistance.

But it would be a serious error nonetheless for Congress to slash funding for the TennesseeTombigbee Waterway. which will open an important link between Americas inland waterways. The TennTom is more than 82 per cent completed. To disrupt funding now would only delay construction and add to the costs of completing the project. To cut off funding would in the long run be more costly than to finish the project. The Federal Government already has made a major commitment to finishing the TTW. It would be pennywise and pound foolish to stop the project or severely restrict fund. Ing. The costs for restoring this land to its natural conditions would be more than twice the cost of finishing the project. The TTW is a 234mile navigation project that will begin at the Tennessee River on the TennesseeMississippi border. wind south through Mississippl and Alabama. and end at the Demopolls lock and dam in Alabama. An existing waterway flows from that point to the Port of Mobile on the gulf coast. The project was originally authorized by Congress in 1946 but was not funded until much later. Construction began in 1972 and will be completed in 1985. The project has been consistently ahead of schedule in spite of numerous court battles and environmental concerns. As an important addition to the transportation system linking Americas heartland with important shipping ports on the gulf coast. the TennTom will improve our ability to export coal. grains. and other mineral. agricultural. and industial products. The TennTom wil provide valuable shipping lanes for Ohio coalfi.lds and enhance our ability to reduce our dependence on Middle East oil. It will also ease the way for an expected jump in coal exports. which are expected to double in the next 18 years. Great care has been taken throughout the project to protect the environment. The TTW was the first major water project built under the National Environmental Policy Act. Construction has been monitored by a threemember Board of Environmental Consultants. which - includes distinguished experts in environmental concerns. The TennTom has stirred considerable controversy throughout the life of the project. Much of this was prompted by environmental concerns. economic fears. and vested railroad interests that feared increased competition from the TennTom. But those fights should be behind us. The project has been funded every year since 1968. Regardless of the original debates. the basic issue now is whether we want to continue our Federal commitment to the TennTom or abandon it and miss an opportunity to realize more than $127 million in benefits annually for the next 50 years. The total cost of the project. according to official figures compiled by the Government. will be $1.830 billion. Already. $1.3 billion has been spent and $4.5 billion has been committed. Eight of the ten locks and dams are completed. the other two are under construction. More than 154 miles of channel have been completed and the waterway is open to traffic below Columbus. Miss.. the halfway point. The Corps of Engineers estimates that about $350 million will complete the project. With so much invested already. it would be economically unsound to abandon the project. The past 6 Presidents and 14 consecutive Congresses have supported funding for the TennTom. In one court case after another. Federal judges have ruled in favor of continuing this project. The surrounding States of Mississippi. Alabama. Tennessee. Kentucky. Florida. Georgia. and Louisiana have strongly invested State and local funds in this waterway. Based on the longterm promise of Federal dollars to finish the project. the States in the regiun have invested more than $159 million in new bridges. highway and utility relocations. and other costs. These States made these investments in good faith and would be unable to recover those costs if the full waterway is not opened. Opponents of the project have claimed recently that the ultimate costs of the project will exceed $3 billion. an estimate that includes the cost of improvements below Demopolis. Ala.. and in the Port of Mobile. Stch improvements have not been authorized by Congress. The Levin amendment passed in 1981 limits the funding to $1.83 billion. The benefittocost ratio from this investment is conservatively estimated to be 3 to 1an excellent return ratio.e\n',midst severe recession question funding controversial water project understandable serious error slash funding open important link waterway more cent complete disrupt funding delay construction add cost complete project cut funding long run costly finish project make major commitment finish pennywise_pound foolish stop project restrict fund cost restore land natural condition more cost finish project navigation project begin border wind end lock_dam exist waterway flow point coast project authorize fund construction begin complete project schedule spite numerous court battle environmental concern important addition transportation system link heartland important shipping port coast improve ability export coal grain other mineral agricultural industial product wil provide valuable shipping_lane coalfi.ld enhance ability reduce dependence oil ease way expect jump coal export expect double next year great care take project protect environment first major water project build construction monitor include distinguished expert environmental concern stir considerable controversy life project much prompt environmental concern economic fear vested railroad interest fear increased competition fight project fund year original debate basic issue want continue commitment abandon miss opportunity realize more benefit next year total cost project accord official figure compile spend commit lock_dam complete other construction more mile channel complete waterway open traffic halfway point estimate complete project much invest unsound abandon project past president consecutive support funding court case federal judge rule favor continue project surround invest state local fund waterway base longterm promise federal dollar finish project regiun invest more new bridge highway utility relocation other cost make investment good faith unable recover cost full waterway open opponent project claim ultimate cost project exceed estimate include cost improvement stch improvement authorize amendment pass limit funding benefittocost_ratio investment estimate 1an excellent return,97.0,daily,1,0

Mr. Chairman. as I indicated in the debate on the rule. this is a bill on which all Members of the minority voted ""no"" when it emerged from the committee. The principal objection that we had to it was the terrible irony of bringing out a reconciliation bill that was supposed to reduce the deficit and then finding within the bill a billion dollars worth of new spending programs. In addition. I think taking a look at the committees whole jurisdiction and seeing that the bill represents a real failure in some very excellent opportunities which we had to make real deficit reduction savings. Nobody regrets that more than I do. I think the committee worked hard to bring out a good product. and the bill is not without some redeeming qualities. In general. however. it falls so far short of a responsible challenge to work down the deficit. that the bill must command a ""no"" vote. I am particularly disturbed with some of the new programs that are created. they have been referred to by other speakers. Many will discuss the new program. Mr. Chairman. one of the things that has not been discussed very thoroughly about this bill is the extension of the cigarette tax. In fact. one of the ways that the Ways and Means Committee met its responsibilities under our cream puff budget resolution was in two very large tax areas. One. the extension of the cigarette tax. and the other in the imposition of very large additional Superfund taxes. The cigarette tax. to which I do not object. in fact. it probably should be higher. is objectionable because it turns around and gives a penny of that cigarette tax back to the producers as a gift from the taxpayers of America. which I think taxpayers would prefer not to give. This amounts to a couple of hundred million dollars a year. and would be better saved or not even taxed than to simply be given back in an automafic spending kind of regimen. Mr. Chairman. there are some redeeming aspects as I noted before. One of the important ones comes in the Customs authorization bill. Mr. Chairman. one aspect of the bill I do support is the provisions on customs user fees. Although it is difficult to move to a user fee system. the increasing demands on the Customs Service and the additional functions necessary to provide efficient and expeditious processing of merchandise have made it necessary to establish a system of fees to cover certain costs. Without user fees. given budgetary pressures. I am afraid we will begin to move backward with respect to the operation of the Customs Service. We moved rather quickly in the Ways and Means Committee to devise the kinds of user fees to be collected and how the moneys should be deposited in the U.S. Treasury. Some problems have emerged since the bill was reported which I hope can be resolved in conference. One such problem is preserving the automatic reimbursement to the Customs Services appropriation of overtime and other reimbursable fees. These fees are paid by the importer directly to Customs to cover special activities such as overtime or assistance to INS and Department of Agriculture and. under existing law. are reimbursed immediately to the agencys appropriation. Also. some clarification of the bills provisions may be necessary to avoid double fees on vessels or on railroad cars not carrying freight. I hope we can take care of these minor but important changes in conference as well as eliminate the more significant objectionable provisions that escalate costs and. in effect. defeat our efforts to balance the budget. I think these things can be taken care of. I make note of them so that Members will be advised that there will be necessary changes made in the conference committee. Mr. Chairman. this is a good effort on the part of the committee. The effort tell short. the reconciliation bill is inadequate. The vote should be ""no."" Mr. Chairman.

In response to skyrocketing demand. U.S. exports of steam coal are projected to increase from 2.5 million tons in 1979 to 1520 million tons in 1985. to 2550 million tons in 1990. and to 70150 million tons by the year 2000. In addition. metallurgical coal exports are projected to be an additional 50 million tons per year. These projections notwithstanding. the capability of the United States to supply much of the growth in the worlds energy needsor whether It instead will be supplied with coal from Australia. South Africa. Canada and other competitorsdepends upon our ability to overcome shortterm transportation obstacles. As recent press reports have indicated. virtually every coal port on the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts Is faced with long. costly delays. These delays may well wipe out the competitive advantage that U.S. coal now enjoys. For example. a 75.000 long ton vessel waiting to load for 30 days wouldbecause of demurrage chargesadd a $6 charge to each long ton of coal delivered. Moreover. the inability to load coal in a timely manner backs up the entire transportation system. causing coal producers to put mines on short weeks or lay off workers. As an example of the inadequacy of existing coal loading facilities and the effect of this inadequacy on domestic coal production. consider my state of Pennsylvania. The potentical increases In Pennsylvania coal production are very much dependent upon improvements to port facilities in Erie and Philadelphia. To demonstrate the potential for Increased coal production in Pennsylvania graphically. the original block of coal in Pennsylvania can be envisioned as a rectangle one mile high. one mile wide. and 17 miles long. Today. that .block of Pennsylvania coal is one mile high. one mile wide. and still 13 miles long. Pennsylvania coal productionnow 80 million tons of coal per yearhas Increased only 1 percent per year since 1975. Based on proven recoverable reserves. however. Pennsylvania could Increase its coal production by 50 percentand maintain this increased level of production for at least the next 200 years. The potential implications for reducing U.S. dependence on imported oil are clear: One ton of coal is equivalent to 4.5 barrels of oil. The U.S. imports some three billion barrels of petroleum per year. and Therefore. the 120 million tons of coal that the state could produce represents the equivalent of 540 million barrels of oilor 18 percent of U.S. petroleum imports. In Pennsylvania. as in other states. inadequate coal loading port facilities are a major obstacle to realization of this potential. At the Port of Philadelphia. for example. the Conrail facilities at Pier 124 have a capacity of only two million net tons of coal per year. Currently. there is a sixweek backlog of coal waiting to be loaded there. Similarly. at the Port of Erie. officials have installed a temporary radial stacker until permanent coal loading facilities can hopefully be constructed. Projects planned by the state government In Pennsylvania will alleviate only part of the pressure on these port facilities. State bond issues under consideration would finance a $24 million modernization project at the Port of Philadelphia to finance expansion of the capacity of Pier 124 to ten million tons and. at Erie. a $10 million project to construct a permanent coal loading facility capable of handling five million tons per year. with storage capacity of two million tons. These projects. although long overdue. will not in themselves be sufficient to help Pennsylvania realize its coal production potential. For these reasons. I Dlan to introduce legislation at the beginning of the next Congress to supplement state efforts. For the Port of Philadelphia. I propose legislation to develop a comprehensive plan for the eventual reopening of Port Richmondan abandoned coal loading facility owned by Conrailas a major coal export facility capable of handling up to 30 million tons of coal per year. Because of the vast export potential. I would expect that actual construction of such a facility would be financed with private capital. At the Port of Erie. Federal action on three fronts is needed to ensure that the potential for this port to serve domestic and overseas markets via shipments on the Saint Lawrence Seaway Is in fact realized. First. repayment of the debt on the Saint Lawrence Seaway must be stretched out from the current 50year term to 80 years. Otherwise. Seaway tolls--which will be renegotiated with Canada next yearwill escalate as debt service will climb from $2.5 million per year to $5 million. Tolls charged users of the Seaway pay all operations and maintenance costs (this is typically not the case for other inland navigation projects or coastal ports). Moreover. users of ports on ""Americas fourth seacoast"" also pay. through tolls. the retirement of the $110 million debt on the Seaway. Passage of this legislation would not forgive the debt nor would it erase the competitive disadvantage now experienced by Great Lakes ports because of the tolls charged to pay operations and maintenance costs and retire debt. It would merely keep tolls from escalating above the inflation rate. Second. Interstate Highway 79 needs to be extended from its current terminus at Twelfth Street and Erie to connect with E. Sixth Street. This direct access is needed so that trucks carrying coal and other products to the port do not have to traverse downtown commercial and residential streets. Already truck traffic to the port Is about 700.000 tons per year. assuming 20ton trucks. this volume of traffic translates into 3.500 trucks per year. Traffic is expected to increase even further as coal shipment facilities are developed. Third. rail lines should not be abandoned that are essential for the transport of coal to port facilities at Erie. As an example of such abandonment. a 27mile link between Corry and Titusville was abandoned several years ago. Other such abandonments in the Erie area are now under consideration by Conrail. In short. the need to Improve coal port facilities to facilitate increased domestic coal production is so critical that I feel it needs to be explicitly addressed as part of the National Energy Transportation Study. In addition. the Study should cite specific examples of what needs to be done at ports like Erie and Philadelphia to augment their coal loading capability. I hope that you will be able to Incorporate these considerations in the Study. Should you have any questions about this request. please do not hesitate to contact me or my Legislative Assistant. Mike Lockerby (Telephone 2246324). Thank you.

I oppose the amendment offered by the gentleman from Washington [Mr. Dicxs] that would bar the use of any funds authorized in the bill to deploy nuclear weapons systems that would exceed the numerical sublimitations imposed by SALT II. Such legislation is based on faulty assumptions and does not best serve our national security interests. Instead. I urge my colleagues to support the Broomfield alternative which calls for mutual full compliance with the unratified. expired SALT II. In essence. we will abide by this agreement as long as the Soviets do as well. This is not a nonbinding resolution. this is law. It is clear beyond any doubt that the Soviets have violated SALT II and other arms control agreements. Examining SALT II alone. there are at least four clear violations. The Soviets are: Producing the SS25 ICBM. exceeding the strategic nuclear delivery vehicle limit. encrypting telemetry. and concealing the association between a missile and its launcher. Any one of these violations is grounds for cancellation of the agreement. In 1979. President Carter stated that a violation of any important part of the agreement as each of these noted violations are. "" * * would be a basis on which to reject the treaty in its entirety."" Amendments like Mr. DIcKs cannot meaningfully restrain Soviet forces nor can it bring the Soviets back into compliance with its past commitments. It can hurt our own and our allies national security and future arms control agreements. First. it keeps us from continuing the strategic modernization we need to maintain a credible defense against the growing. unchecked Soviet threat. Second. this legislation can send exactly the wrong signal to the Soviet leadership. If we are unwilling to maintain deterrence or take appropriate actions in response to Soviet noncompliance. our credibility at the arms negotiation table will be endangered and our ability to secure fair. equal agreements will be lessened. Since entering office. President Reagans message has been one of restraint and reductions. He has continuously proposed strategic arms reduction talks [START]. Despite all the flagrant Soviet violations of SALT. the President ""went that extra mile"" in May when he retired the two older Poseidon submarines so that a new Trident vessel would not exceed any of the SALT limits. However. the Soviets have made no policy changes and continue to improve their arsenal at our expense. The Soviets must be shown that we are serious about our defense and keeping arms control agreements mutually beneficial. The conversion of the 131st B52 into a cruise missile launcher is scheduled for later this year. During this interim period. the ball is in the Soviets court. Should they decide not to seriously address our arms control concerns. we must take the measure necessary for our defense whether or not they strictly adhere to SALT II. Poorly focused. one sided restraint is not real arms control. The big buildup some are predicting without SALT has been going on under SALT and continues. Our willingness to counter these Soviet violations will bring them back to the negotiating table and will enhance genuine. mutual restraint. Amendments which prevent the United States from seriously countering Soviet violations place unacceptable. unilateral. and dangerous constraints on the United States and gives the Soviets an unchecked advantage. Therefore. I urge my colleagues to stand up for Americas defensive concerns and reject the Dicks amendment which only unilaterally and unconditionally binds us to an agreement the Soviets have no qualms about violating. Lets send the world a different message. We are serious about arms control and will abide by SALT II provided the Soviets do. Mr. Chairman. many Members call for action on arms control.

U.S. dependence on foreign oil has created enormous trade deficits which lead to rampant inflation. The current rate is 13.4 percent. This results in the greatest hardships for persons who must live on fixed incomes. In addition to the reduced buying power of the dollar. energy costs have risen dramatically. Gasoline and heating oil have doubled in price since 1973. Electricity and natural gas have experienced similar increases. There is general recognition by the President and the Congress that some method must be devised to relieve the economic hardship on people living on fixed incomes which is caused from increased energy costs. The question is not whether or not relief should be forthcoming. The question is who will bear the cost. How will the energy aid policy be financed? There is no easy answer. Do we devise a policy that would reduce utility rates for people living on fixed incomes causing an increase for the remaining customers served? This energy aid policy would mean increasing the burden on middleincome Americans who are already up against the financial wall. Does the Congress formulate an energy aid policy of direct Federal subsidies to persons living on fixed incomes? If this be the solution then we must decide how the energy aid payments would be financed. There are two possibilities. It is unlikely that Congress will enact a tax increase to finance this worthy program for a tax increase under present circumstances would increase the likelihood of a recession which we must try to prevent. However. if Congress enacts an energy aid program without providing revenues with which to finance that program the Federal deficit will be increased compounding the spiraling inflation which must be brought under control. There is a third possibility that invites much discussion. Does Congress provide energy aid relief by imposing a windfall profit tax on oil companies? This is appealing for it provides revenues without inflationary impact. But how much of these revenues are desperately needed for energy research and development. the result of which will provide new alternative energy sources needed to free America from our dependence on foreign oil?

510152139,S,18900918,25,Mr. PLUMB,Unknown,PLUMB,Unknown,M,387,495,09181890.txt,7196,429,51054821,PLUMB,PRESTON,S,KS,M,R,,voting,Mr. President. I observed that editorial at the time it appeared with a great deal of concern. The paper in which it appeared is not only a very able paper. but one which is properly very close to the Administration. It has been given out that it more nearly represented the Treasury Department than any other newspaper in the country. It was also a conspicuous and virulent opponent of the silver bill. and for fhat reason. as well as for others I have spoken of. its utterances are. ofcourse. entitled to great consideration. Butthe fear which I had. growing out of that article and on other grounds. that the bill. which was passed with such great unanimity on this side of the Chamber. would not be properly carried out. disappeared on account of the first step taken by the Administration. by the more or less public announcement that it was to be. as far as possible. carried out according to its intent as understood by its friends and promoters. and not according to any preconceived notion of the importance or lack of importance of the question or of the personal views of the Sccretary in regard to the propriety of the enactment. So. Mr. President. in offering this resolution I am not now prepared to say that this has been done with any intent whatever. but probably it is the result of some old regulation of the Department or something of that sort. some person in some room of the building who has these matters in charge has decided this question without the Secretary having had. any opportunity to consider it. I suppose there is no Department of the Government in which there are so many of these dustcovered rules prevailing as in the Treasury Department. One of them came to light very conspicuously the other day. The Secretary of the Treasury. for the purpose of relieving the stockbrokers of New York. determined to exercise the power conferred upon him by law of. prepaying interest on Government bonds. but it was found to be practically without avail. because of a rule in the Treasury Department that no man could be paid interest on any of the bonds standing id his name unless they were all presented. but it would turn out. as it did in almost all cases where there was a large amount of bonds in the hands of one man. that some one. two. or more of the bonds bad been sold. and the evidence of sale and transfer of the proprietorship of the bonds had not been registered and made known to the Department. The consequence was that the interest on the larger lots of bonds could not be anticipated. .and thus the whole purpose of the Secretary was balked by reason of a xule made some timein the missionary period of the Government. and so what was intended to be wise and beneficial was ineffectual. and it was only under pressure of a threatened panic in New York. that the Secretary concluded to change this ruling in such avvay that whoever presented a bond. being the owner ofcourse. might have interest paid on the bonds he presented without requiring him to show that those were all the bonds he owned. So in this case it may be. and very likely is. that some clerk has made this rule. that it grows out of some convenience of bookkeeping or something of that sort. or it may be that there is some animus back of it. but not that of the Secretary. as I am bound to believe. It seems to me that the soonerthe Treasury Department is conformed in its operations to ordinary business principles the better it is going to be. There never has been in all the history of this Government so conspicuous anillustration of the impolicy of allowing the Treasury Department to have anything to do which obstructs or accelerates business. as has occurred in the last few weeks. For monthsfor yearsthe Treasury Department hoarded money which was needed for the transaction of the business of the country. and during all that period of time the volume of money was constantly shrinking by reason of the retirement of nationalbank notes. and the Secretary hugged to his bosom the old idea that a certain amount was necessary to be kept on hand as a reserve. without any reference to the business of the country outside. The increasing business of the country was constantly hampered for the lack of that money. while he held onto it. which was taken from the people by the operations of the Government and was needed to be returned at the earliest possible moment. in order that the business of the country might be properly conducted without stress. and so it happened that instead of putting out the money last summer. last spring. last winter. a year ago. or a year and a half ago. duringall thiq time when the retirement of nationalbank notes was going on. the Secretary waited until a panic was impending. not merely a speculators panic. but a stringency in the money market which affected the banks of all the cities aqd seriously interfered with the ordinary business operations of the country. and then lie did what? He gave out the money to the holders of Government bonds. under such circumstances as to enable them. and not him. to control the money supply of this country at their pleasure. The money which the day before yesterday wps in the Treasury and liable to be put out by the will of the Secretary. today is in the hands of the men who own the bonds to the amount of $16.000.000. and more than thatabout $20.000.000because the bonds were bought at about 25 per cent. premium or something over. and it is perfectly safe to say that these men having this money. and thereby this great control over the money market. will use it to better themselves and their interests. and not the interests of the people of the United States. Now. ii this money. in place of being dumped into the pockets of a favored few. had been put into the channels of trade as fast as it came into the Treasury last year and the year before and last month and the month belore. it could not have been subject to the control of anybody. because. like the blood in the human system. it would have been dispersed through the entire frame. performing its legitimate functions. I want to say now. as I have said before. not with the expectation of its having any effect. that nothing in the world but an overwhelming calamity will ever divorce the Treasury from this malicious interference with the business ofthecountry. and that calamity will not come this year. and I hope it will never come. but we shall never have the Treasury occupying the proper relations to the business of this country until there has been a calamity which enforces the wickedness of the present system. which of course is not the misfortune or fault of the person who may be for the time being administering the Treasury Department. but the fault of the law and the fault of the system. but still. whoever administers that system ought to consider himself obligated by as solemn an obligation as anybody ever operated under to put every single dollar of the money which he collects from the people of the United States back into the channels of trade at the earliest possible moment in order that the withdrawal of money by the collection of taxes may not be hurtful to the business interests of the country.\n',observe editorial time appear great deal concern paper appear able paper close give represent other newspaper country conspicuous virulent opponent silver bill reason other speak utterance ofcourse entitle great consideration fear grow article other ground bill pass such great unanimity side carry disappear account first step take less public announcement possible carry accord intent understand friend promoter accord preconceived_notion importance lack importance question personal view regard propriety enactment offer resolution prepared say do intent result old regulation sort person room building matter charge decide question have opportunity consider suppose many dustcovere rule prevail come light other day purpose relieve stockbroker determined exercise power confer law prepay interest bond find avail rule man pay interest bond stand d name present turn case large amount bond hand man more bond bad be sell evidence sale transfer proprietorship bond register make known consequence interest large lot bond anticipate whole purpose balk reason xule make timein missionary period intend wise beneficial ineffectual pressure threaten panic conclude change ruling such avvay present bond owner ofcourse interest pay bond present require show bond own case clerk make rule grow convenience bookkeeping sort animus bind believe seem soonerthe conform operation ordinary business principle go history conspicuous anillustration impolicy allow obstruct accelerate business occur last few week hoard money need transaction business country period time volume money shrink reason retirement note hug_bosom old idea certain amount necessary keep hand reserve reference business country increase business country hamper lack money hold take people operation need return early possible moment order business country conduct stress happen put money last summer last spring last winter year year half time retirement note go wait panic impend speculator panic_stringency money market affect bank city interfere ordinary business operation country lie give money holder bond such circumstance enable control money supply country pleasure money day yesterday wps liable put will today hand man own bond amount more thatabout 20.000.000because bond buy cent premium safe say man have money great control money market use better interest interest people money place dump pocket favor few put channel trade come last year year last month month subject control blood human system disperse entire frame perform legitimate function want say say expectation have effect world overwhelming calamity divorce malicious interference business ofthecountry calamity come year hope come occupy proper relation business country calamity enforce wickedness present system course misfortune fault person time administer fault law fault system administer system consider obligate solemn_obligation operate put single dollar money collect people channel trade early possible moment order withdrawal money collection taxis hurtful business interest country.\n,51.0,bound,1,0
1050067436,S,19970731,785,Mr. GRASSLEY,Unknown,GRASSLEY,Unknown,M,40754,41032,07311997.txt,9577,683,105119591,GRASSLEY,CHARLES,S,IA,M,R,,voting,Mr. President. I am privileged to be in the Senate today to support passage of this historic legislation. In my career as a Senator. a Congressman. and a State legislator. I have participated in thousands of bills. Posterity will probably remember only a select few of them. Of all. I expect. and hope. those who keep apprised of Congress will remember this tax freedom reconciliation bill among those remembered most fondly and most often. . This bill is not only about the Government living within the Nations means. but about the Constitution itself. Two years ago. the Congress proved that it could pass a balanced budget. It also learned that the Constitution anticipates a third participant in the legislative process. the executive branch. So. we arrive here today not only having anticipated the needs of the President. we have included the executive branch as an active participant throughout the legislative process. The words of the Constitution do not proscribe that Congress and the President should enter into an agreement defining legislation before it is actually written. -Furthermore. the Constitution does not proscribe that the Congress should advance legislation with the continued advice of the Office of the President. the Treasury Department. and the Office of Management and Budget. The words themselves simply allow the President theexpress authority to either enact or veto the bills that we in the Congress produce. However. the partnership forged between the President and Congress prove that the President can. and should. make his intentions known throughout the legislative process. Since the President can veto any bill that Is sent to him. the process should allow that their contents of bills should not come as a surprise. But. it is not the Presidents reaction that should be avoided. It is the surprise of taxpayers. As the legislative process has evolved. too much progress occurs behind the closed doors of committees and caucuses. The people of the Nation have come to think of the legislative process as a black box. The good intentions go in one side. but something wholly unknown can come out the other. The President has always had the authority to veto and the Congress the power to reconsider. But. in modern times. our legislative processes have become so cumbersome that Congress leaves itself without the days necessary to reconsider huge reconciliation bills. Therefore. we have effectively revamped the legislative process by allowing the President to play an earlier role. Some might say that this is a significant change. Since the Constitution does not direct such a partnership. it must be implied therein. Our Constitution intends that we pass laws. not only bills. Therefore. I turn to the product of this new process: The tax freedom reconciliation bill of 1997. Earlier today. we passed the balanced budget reconciliation bill. The latter is the first spending bill that anticipates a balance in almost 30 years of gridlock. The former is the first tax bill in 16 years that actually cuts taxes. Together. they are the first omnibus reconciliation legislation in 4 years that will become law. Presently we are considering the tax freedom reconciliation bill. I am particularly proud of several provisions contained in this bill. Some of these sections have national perspectives like both the renewed income tax deduction for interest on student loans and estate tax relief. Others have a more regional effect such as the law turning back the unauthorized IRS expansion of the alternative minimum tax against farmers. All. however. provide relief to hardworking families in the areas of education and income security. For education. this taxrelief bill renews the deductibility of interest incurred on student loans. I have introduced that particular bill in every Congress since it was repealed in 1986. In the last two Congresses I was accompanied by my friend from Illinois. Senator MOSELEYBRAUN. Today. I am happy to announce our success. When Americans think of investing money. we think of investing in thingsmachines. natural resources or businesses. This student loan provision is an investment in human capabilities and talents. I would like to do even more than what is offered in this provision. But restoring the deductibility on the interest paid on student loans sends a message to college students across the country. Their talents are worth the investment of dollars. Students need to know the Federal Government and the Nation value their contributions. Understanding this. I believe they will have a greater appreciation of the effort necessary to successfully complete a higher education. We are clearly sending the message that the Congress recognizes the financial responsibility students undertake. and we are willing to do what we can to ease that burden. For farmers. I am pleased to announce that another of these new laws will forever repeal the unauthorized IRS advancement of the alternative minimum tax against traditional farmer deferred commodity contracts. The President may offer his views on legislation. but the IRS does not have unilateral power to legislate on its own. This is good news for family farmers and rural America. It reaffirms the intent of Congress that family farmers should be able to continue receiving the use of the cash method of accounting not limited by the AMT. The IRS decision last fall to unilaterally change a 16yearold tax policy for these deferred payments. The IRS was deadwrong. Sixtythree of my colleagues joined my legislation with Senator DORGAN as solid proof. In addition to setting the record straight. turning back the AMT for farmers highlights the larger problem we face when the IRS disregards the intent and the will of Congress. Here. we had a tax policy in place for 16 years. and suddenly. the IRS decides to make a 180 degree turn. which caused a great deal of havoc and concern for thousands of taxpayers. But. in order to return the law to its original intent. we had to come up with hundreds of millions of dollars as an offset. because of the upsidedown way we do revenue estimates around here. So. I hope the Joint Committee on Taxation will be addressing the revenue estimation problem in the near future. I am also proud of the future for estate tax relief for families. When thinking about estate taxes. you have to always keep your eye on the ball. Estates do not pay estate taxes. surviving families pay estate taxes. In this bill we do a number of things for death tax reform. All of these new laws are based on legislation that I introduced with my friend from Montana. Senator BAUCUS. Twenty cosponsors joined in our bill S. 479. the Estate Tax Relief for the American Family Act. It became the estate tax relief legislation embodied in this reconciliation bill providing over $875.000 of new relief. In current law. the general estate tax exemption is $800.000. but that number is more than $200.000 behind the rate of inflation. In nearly every area of my State and the Nation. we saw in the past decade estate tax ultimately confiscate many family farms. Estate tax reform is simply about fairness and equity for families. Weve heard some make the faulty argument that the estate tax only affects a small percentage of taxpayers. Well. the point they leave out is that many other thousands of taxpayers have to waste a great deal of money in order to plan their estate so it will remain operational and in the family. In addition. without the relief under this bill. the number of those affected by the estate tax would increase substantially in the next 5 to 10 years. Let me also add that I strongly support estate tax relief because it directly helps preserve our natural land. Our estate tax relief is very proenvironment simply because it helps keep family farms operational and defers the danger of overdevelopment by urban activities. In this bill. capital gains tax relief is the partner of estate tax reform. Capital gains tax relief is similarly vital to my State of Iowa. A disproportionate amount of farmland is held by older landowners. To illustrate. studies in my state of Iowa show that 42 percent of farmland is held by taxpayers over the age of 65. Last year. Iowa State University conducted its annual farm life survey. It found that in the next 5 years. 21 percent of Iowa farmers are planning to retire. This high rate of those leaving farming raises important questions about who will be the next generation of Iowa farmers. Some of those farmers who retire will want to hold onto the land and maybe rent it out. Many others want to sell the land. move to town. and be fully retired. Unfortunately. the capital gains tax has locked them on the farm. I support an even larger reduction in the capital gains rate. But. the reduction in the bill is certainly a very positive step in thQ right direction. Finally. I want to talk about the expanded availability of tax supported individual retirement accounts. With the constraints of the Tax Code reduced. we will have more people saving for their retirements. Homemakers will be able to save $2000 per year taxfree regardless of the tax free retirement program offered to the working spouse. These new prosaving laws will reduce the strain on the Social Security system. This Congress produced all of this relief for families by using bipartisanship and cooperation with the executive branch. This cooperation was not expressed in so many words of the Constitution. but it must certainly have been implied. Thank you Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n',privileged today support passage historic legislation career legislator participate thousand bill posterity remember select few expect hope keep apprise remember tax freedom reconciliation bill remember bill live mean year prove pass balanced_budget learn anticipate third participant legislative process executive_branch arrive today have anticipate need include executive_branch active_participant legislative process word proscribe enter agreement define legislation write proscribe advance legislation continue advice word allow theexpress authority enact veto bill produce partnership forge prove make intention know legislative process veto bill send process allow content bill come surprise reaction avoid surprise taxpayer legislative process evolve much progress occur closed_door committee caucus people come think legislative process black box good intention go side unknown come other authority veto power reconsider modern time legislative process become cumbersome leave day necessary reconsider huge reconciliation bill revamp legislative process allow play early role say significant change direct partnership imply intend pass law bill turn product new process tax freedom reconciliation bill today pass balanced_budget reconciliation bill latter first spending bill anticipate balance year gridlock former first tax bill year cut taxis first omnibus reconciliation legislation year become law consider tax freedom reconciliation bill proud several provision contain bill section national perspective renew income tax deduction interest student loan estate tax relief other regional effect such law turn unauthorized expansion alternative minimum tax farmer provide relief hardworke family area education income security education taxrelief bill renew deductibility interest incur student loan introduce particular bill repeal last congress accompany friend today happy announce success think invest money think invest_thingsmachine natural_resource business student loan provision investment human capability talent like more offer provision restore deductibility interest pay student loan send message college student country talent worth investment dollar student need know nation value contribution understand believe great appreciation effort necessary complete high education send message recognize financial responsibility student undertake willing ease burden farmer pleased announce new law repeal unauthorized advancement alternative minimum tax traditional farmer defer commodity contract offer view legislation unilateral power legislate own good news family farmer rural reaffirm intent family farmer able continue receive use cash method accounting limit decision last fall change tax policy deferred_payment deadwrong colleague join legislation solid proof addition set record straight turn amt farmer highlight large problem face disregard intent will tax policy place year decide make degree turn cause great deal havoc concern thousand taxpayer order return law original intent come hundred_million dollar offset upsidedown way revenue estimate hope address revenue estimation problem near_future proud future estate tax relief family think estate taxis keep eye_ball estate pay estate taxis survive family pay estate taxis bill number thing death tax reform new law base legislation introduce friend cosponsor join bill become estate tax relief legislation embody reconciliation bill provide new relief current law general estate tax exemption number more rate inflation area see past decade estate tax confiscate many family farm estate tax reform fairness_equity family ve hear make faulty argument estate tax affect small percentage taxpayer point leave many other thousand taxpayer waste great deal money order plan estate remain operational family addition relief bill number affect estate tax increase next year let add support estate tax relief help preserve natural land estate tax relief proenvironment help keep family farm operational defer danger overdevelopment urban activity bill capital_gain tax relief partner estate tax reform capital_gain tax relief vital disproportionate amount farmland hold old landowner illustrate study state show percent farmland hold taxpayer age last year conduct annual farm life survey find next year percent farmer plan retire high rate leave farming raise important question next generation farmer farmer retire want hold land rent many other want sell land move town retire capital_gain tax lock farm support large reduction capital_gain rate reduction bill positive step right direction want talk expand availability tax support individual retirement account constraint reduce more people save retirement homemaker able save year taxfree tax free retirement program offer working spouse new prosaving law reduce strain system produce relief family use bipartisanship cooperation executive_branch cooperation express many word imply thank yield_floor.\n,105.0,daily,1,0

The report of the majority shows that this difference would be about $22.000.000. but the effect overreaches that completely. By the legislation which demonetized silver it was reduced to the grade of token money. not only in America but in Europe as well. Now. if we restore the silver bullion to a parity with the coin. ipso fa cto we substantially restore the character and value of silver money. not merely in our own country. but all over the continent of Europe. At the present time every great banking center looks to its gold reserve as the support of credit. and it is estimated that ninetenths of the businessof the world is transacted on a credit basis. At this time there is about $1.500.000.000 of silver coin in Europe and America. If it is no longer a support of credit it has been deprived of ninetenths of its power as money: that is to say. it has lost $1.350.000.000 of its value. That estimate though goes too far. because silver certainly does support credit to some extent. especially in the smaller transactions of the people. But if we assume that it has been deprived of twothirds of its power as a support of credit then the effect of remonetizing it would be to reonforce the currency of the two continents by substantially $900.000.000 of standard coin. Money thrown into the circulation of Europe would benefit this country also. because by increasing the circulation in Europe it would increase the power of foreign countries to buy our commodities and in that way would raise the prices of American products.\n',think add number dollar take bullion_coin rate bullion value get difference currency report majority show difference effect overreach legislation demonetize_silver reduce grade token money restore silver_bullion parity coin restore character value silver money own country continent present time great banking center look gold reserve support credit estimate ninetenth businessof world transact credit basis time silver_coin support credit deprive ninetenth power money say lose value estimate go silver support credit extent small transaction people assume deprive twothird power support credit effect remonetize reonforce currency continent standard coin money throw circulation benefit country increase circulation increase power foreign country buy commodity way raise price american products.\n,52.0,bound,1,0

This rule excludes the students vote. Under this rule they are legal voters at their former homes. Still another rule is prescribed. it is this: A person shall not be considered to have gained a residence in any county of this State into which he comes for temporary purposes merely. without the intention of making such county his home. Applying this rule. it is perfectly clear that these students had no voting residence where these schools are located. The Ohio statutes require a person whose vote is challenged upon the ground of residence to answer this question: When you came into this county did you come for a temporary purpose merely. or for the purpose of making it your home? In this question is found the spirit and intent of the law. Is it not plain. perfectly plain. that these students had novoting residence at these colleges ? They were there for atemporary purpose only and with no intention to make them their homes. Giving effect to these statutory provisions. the senate of Ohio at its last session had no trouble in deciding the contest between Mickey and Loomis for a seat in that body. The right to the seat turned on the vote of a few college students at Oberlin College. The senate determined that these students were not residents of the town of Oberlin. and consequently their votes were illegal. These statutes. Mr. Speaker. are wise and just enactments. They are as they should be. No citizen of Ohio would change them. They make the votingplace of every voter the place of his residence. What better policy can be suggested? Let these laws be enforced rigidly at every poll. and our elective system would be purer and better. Suffrage. under the qualifications these statutes prescribe. is the right of every Ohioan. To allow even one vote to be polled where the voter has no legal residence violates law. The municipal affairs of a town in which a college is located are of too much consequence and interest to the actual residentsto allow residents of other comities and States attending the college a vote in their management and control. It would be unjust and impolitic to give sanction to such a policy. If the college students who voted for the contestee were legal voters. then their right to vote at the local elections in these precincts is clear and unquestionable. The time may come when the partisans at these votingprecincts will not only speak and print. but pray against the right of the students attending their schools to vote at their elections. Let me be understood. There is no unfriendliness upon my part to college students. or to their voting when legally qualified. at all elections. Their votes I believe to be quite evenly divided between the two great political parties of the country. I have no words at my command to express my admiration and esteem for him whose purpose it is to be educated. In his struggle for the means to educate himself I would give him every encouragement and support. When the means are provided by parents. other relatives. or by friends. he stands none the less high in my regard. God speed them in their noble endeavors. The students in our schools. colleges. and universities axe the rose and expectance of our country. I would deny them no right which tmse otherwise engaged enjoy. But the supremacy of the law must be maintained. It declares that in Ohio no person shall vote except at the p lace of his residence. College students. as a general rule. have no residence at the place where the college is located. The exceptions to this rule are few. The student within the rule must. if he would vote. go to his place of residence. The student within the exception may vote at the precinct in which the college is situated. This is the law. and as the law it should have our respect and be rigidly enforced. Mr. Speaker. I have said that 3 votes were cast for the contestee by inmates of the Dayton (Ohio) Soldiers Home. These 3 votes are illegal. I understand from the proofs in the case that each of these three inmates of the home was absent from the home on furlough or leave of absence. I understand that when an inmate of the home desires to leave for a temporary period he receives a furlough or leave of absence. In case he returns to the home within the life of his leave he is admitted of course. I understand from the testimony that these three soldiers were visiting at their former homes and that their leaves did not expire until after the election day. These soldiers voted for the contestee at their former homes. I insist that their voting residence was at the soldiers home. In Ohio the resldence of soldiers for the purpose of voting has given both political parties considerable trouble. Ten or twelve years ago the Legislature. when Republican in both branches. enacted this law: Disabled soldiers who are inmates of a national asylum for disabled volunteer soldiers. who are citizens of the United States. and have resided in this State one year next preceding the election. and are otherwise qualified as to age and residence within the county and township. shall be held and deemed to have their lawfnl residence in the county and township in which such asylum is located. Now. this law was made for the benefit of soldiers. It was made to save to them the expense. the time. and the inconvenience of going from the soldiers home to their former homes upon election day. It is their permanent home. and so long as they are subject to the rules and regulations of the home. so long as they are subject to the homes discipline. so long as they have not severed their comiection with the home. but are away from it with leave giving the right to return at any time before the leave expires. in contemplation of this law they are still inmates of the home. and their residence therefore is at the home. and they can not vote elsewhere. Whatever rights they may have under the laws at their former homes. it is perfectly clear that as long as they are in legal judgment inmates of the soldiers home. thereand not elsewhere must they vote. For voting purposes. if for nothing else. the statutes of Ohio fix the residence of disabled soldiers who are inmates of a soldiers home in the township where the home is located. Mr. Speaker. I speak today not only for James E. Campbell. but also for 14.390 legal voters of the seventh Congressional district of Ohio who honored him with their suffrages. He is the chosen Representative of that district in the Fortyeighth Congress. The Republican Legislature of Ohio in 1882 districted the State for representation in Congress. In that year the Democratic vote in the State was 316.874. the Republican vote was 297.759. The Democratic vote exceeded the Republican vote by nearly 20.000. In making these districts it was intended. and they were so made. to give the Democrats six and the Republicans fifteen members in this House.

Health and Education bill. its about the Labor. Health and Education bill. The gentleman objects to the fact that we are doing what has been done in this institution for many years. We are taking the bills that are finished in both Houses at this time nd we are trying to get them to the President in the fastest possible way.Ahd the way to do that is to send them down together. Now. the President wants to cherrypick. He wants to pick and choose. He said you have got to send me 11 separate bills. He didnt send us 11 separate bills. The President sends us one omnibus budget. He put all the departments together in one document and sent them down to us. We are sending him back whatever proposals we can put together in the fastest possible time. Madam Speaker. he says that the LaborHealth bill is bloated. Well. let me compare it to the Presidents budget. The President says that he is the ""great decider"" and that he is going to decide how much money is going to be in this bill and we have got to live within that limit or else hes going to veto anything else we send him. If we live under the Presidents budget. we would cut vocational education by 50 percent. Anybody think that is a good idea? If we live under the Presidents budget. we would eliminate all student aid but WorkStudy and Pell Grants. Anybody here really believe that is a good idea? In all my years in Congress. I never heard anybody say: OBEY. why dont you guys get together and cut cancer research. Yet. that is what this previous Republican Congress and the President have done the last 2 years. they have cut 1.100 grants out of the National Institutes of Health. medical research grants. If you want to live under the Presidents budget on law enforcement. we would cut what the committee has in its bill by onethird. The President wants us to cut handicapped kids education by $300 million. Mr. WALSH. the ranking Republican member of the LaborHealth Subcommittee. led the objection to that. and in fact persuaded the committee to put a higher number in the bill than I had put in in the chairmans mark. yet the President says we ought to follow his budget for LaborHealth. If we do. we will cut rural health by 54 percent. He also wants us down the line to cut the Clean Water Revolving Fund by 37 percent. He wants us to cut disabled housing assistance by 47 percent. He has ordered his Secretary of Veterans Affairs to send us a letter indicating that they dont want the $4 billion that we have added to veterans health care. So you dont think this is about priorities? You bet you. its about priorities. I submit to you. the teachers of this country. the school kids of this country. the parents of this country. and the veterans arent going to be fooled. Veterans arent going to be very thrilled if you take care of their needs so long as they are in Iraq. but. the minute they get home you forget the help their kids need to get an education. you forget the help their wifes needs or husbands needs if they run into medical problems. Veterans are whole people. just like everybody else. This Congress has an obligation to meet all of their needs. not just their needs so long as they are wearing the uniform and then forget them once they take it off. That is not the American way.

I rise in support of H.R. 2990. the fiscal year 1990 LaborHealth and Human ServicesEducation appropriations bill. I especially want to thank Chairman NATCHER of the Appropriations Subcommittee on LaborHHSEducation and his members for their leadership in expanding important and costeffective programs for children and their families. Such leadership Is crucial to safeguard the future and protect the Nations children. This legislation. by funding effective programs for children and families. takes action against illiteracy. juvenile crime. poverty. Infant mortality. declining family living standards. family Instability. and the spread of AIDS. And in every instance. the programs supported with those resources provide sound investments with high returns. Every dollar invested In programs such as prenatal care. immunization. or Head Start save at least $3 and as much as $10 in averted Infant deaths. disability. disease or school failure. I am pleased that for the following education programs. the bill meets the goals of the Leadership Task Force on the Family. so that we dont abandon children once they enter the schoolhouse door:. Chapter 1. Compensatory Education for the Disadvantaged was given the highest priority by the committee with an Increase of $1 billion. and. the State Grant Program for the Education of the Handicapped. an $89 million Increase. I also applaud the committees intention to fund. In an expedited manner. the dropout prevention demonstration programs pending their reau. thorization. For many of these children. however. school age is just too late. It is essential to reach vulnerable children In their earliest years. I commend the committees efforts to meet the Leadership Task Force on the Familys goals of serving all eligible children over the next several years. for the following programs: Head Start. Preschool Education for the Handicapped. and the Community and Migrant Health Centers Infant Mortality Initiative. I would urge my colleagues. however. to consider Increased funding for these successful. costeffective prevention programs. especially for the Maternal and Child Health Block Grant. once the reauthorization Is enacted. and for the Childhood Immunization Program. to assure that full and adequate Immunization for most atrisk preschoolers. Acting expedi. tiously Is critical for the youngest. most vulnerable children at a time when their health and wellbeing are in greatest jeopardy: In 1987. the incidence of low birthwelght. the greatest predictor of Infant death and disability. Increased to 6.9 percent. This Is the highest level observed since 1979 The Select Committee on Children. Youth. and Families has documented that low blrthweight can be prevented by early. comprehensive prenatal care. Yet. In 1987. the proportion of mothers who began prenatal care in the critical first trimester of pregnancyalmost 1 out of 4remained unchanged for the eighth year In a row. A significant proportion of preschood children. as high as 55 percent in some communities. are not adequately immunized against A ugust 2. 1989 the major childhood illnesses. In 1988. for instance. nearly half of all California 2yearolds were not fully Immunized for diphtheria. tetanus and pertussis. Physicians from the Centers for Disease Control and childrens hospitals report that some childhood illnesses. such as measles and whooping cough. which had leveled off or declined are now resurgent. There are 11 million children. including 4 million below the poverty line. who have no health insurance. and the number has been growing since 1980. 7 million children do not even receive routine medical care. In California alone. as many as 1.6 million children were uninsured in 1986. including 29 percent of all black children and more than a third of all Latino children. Nationwide. more than 80 percent of lowincome preschoolers are denied Head Start services and as many as 500.000 preschoolers with disabilities may not be receiving the quality. early Intervention services they so critically need. Mr. Chairman. even the significant Increase proposed by the administration for Head Start would enable fewer than 70.000 additional children ages 35 to be served.

The Senator from Massachusetts has referred to it. I think he was very gracious in providing us with an exhibit. which thus substantially destroys his own position in connection with the issue. The fact is that by far the major portion of the traffic contemplated is a brandnew traffic in iron ore moving in to the steel production of the Middle West. something which has not occurred in hardly any degree heretofore. The truth of the matter is that we have exhausted our inland iron ore reserves. under war pressure. to such an extent that there certainly is no fooling about the proposition that we confront a crisis in respect to raw ore materials if the steel production of the Middle West is to continue. All that traffic. as the able Senator from Massachusetts has so graciously indicated. is brand new traffic which is not being taken away from the port of Baltimore or the port of Boston or any other port. because it has not existed heretofore. and it would have to exist on a waterborne basis. It could not possibly be shipped cheaply enough in any other manner because of the tremendous bulk and weight of the product. We could not have developed the steel industry in the Middle West. even during the past yearsand without it I do not know how we could have won the warwith rail transportation. because the ore does not lend itself to rail transportation. It has to be waterborne. and. if possible. without breaking cargo. That is the chief source of contemplated revenue.

I have at all times felt. and still feel. that that incident alone. if nothing else could be shown in the case. would be sufficient to show the unworthiness of Judge Ritter to hold the position which he now fills. According to the evidence of Brodek. which you will find in the hearings--I do not believe you will find the letter that Judge SUMNERS read to youbut according to the evidence of Brodek. which you can find of record by referring to the index. Judge Ritter and his firm. Ritter & Rankin. had represented the Mulford Realty Co. in transactions prior to the time he went on the bench. After he went on the bench. although he admitted that he had been paid in full. he wrote to Brodek. who was acting for the Mulford Realty Co.. and said. in substance. according to Mr. Brodeks evidence. that in certain cases ""I have rendered you competent service. I have saved you money. It Is true you have paid me in full. Nevertheless. I feel that my services were worth more than I received. I am now on the bench. and I feel that you ought to send me an additional $2.000."" The witness said he sent it to him for psychological reasons. What were the psychological reasons? They must have been. as disclosed by the evidence. that the Mulford Realty Co. owned large property interests in the southern district df Florida and felt that the investment of $2.000 in response to the demands from this judge not based upon any valid claim he had against them was yet an investment which would be justified under the circumstances. Suppose you were elected as judge of the superior courts in your State and that prior to your election you had represented a railroad. Suppose. after having gone on the bench. you wrote to your former railroad client and said: ""I am. not representing you any more. I am on the bench now. but I performed good service for you when I was your attorney. and I feel that you ought to send me an additional $2.000."" That railroad company knowing it would have cases pending before you as Judge. through its officers or its general attorney. sends you a check for $2.000 for psychological reasons. is there a Member of this House who would feel that the conduct of a judge asking for and receiving money under such circumstances is in accord with the conduct of a righteous. an upright. and an honest judge?\n'",pay cash scratch_pen take receipt therefor account mythical interest partnership dissolve year receive year think excess professional business time receive fee case pay penny partnership business time least allege item cent truth business record disclose collect fee partnership business pay other payment make check half most fee collect collect fee due partnership time dissolution go bench make accounting therefor collection fee instance make collection sort report absolve_responsibility connection fee colleague state see do report publish proceeding call attention incident act time feel feel incident show case sufficient show unworthiness hold position fill accord evidence find hearing believe find letter sumner read accord evidence find record refer index firm represent transaction time go bench go bench admit pay full write act say substance accord evidence certain case render competent service save money true pay full feel service worth more receive bench feel send additional witness say send psychological reason psychological reason disclose evidence own large property interest southern district df feel investment response demand judge base valid claim investment justify circumstance suppose elect judge superior court state election represent railroad suppose have go bench write former railroad client say represent bench perform good service attorney feel send additional railroad company know case pende officer general attorney send check psychological reason feel conduct judge ask receive money such circumstance accord conduct righteous upright_honest judge?\n,74.0,bound,0,1

I.appreciate the chairman yielding me this time. I rise in opposition to this substitute and in support of the Taxpayers Relief Act of 1997. It has been 16 years since the taxpayers of America have had tax relief from the Federal Government. and todays bill is long overdue. But instead of embracing tax relief. the Democrat minority embraces class warfare. Americas working families are forced to pay over 50 percent of their salaries to the government because of high taxes and costly regulations. No wonder it takes one parent to work for the Government while the other parent works for the family. Instead of working with us to ease that tax burden. the minority leadership offers in their substitute more welfare. It should come as no surprise that the members of the minority oppose this bill. Asking liberals to go support tax relief is like asking aliens to come back to Roswell. If it has not happened in the last 50 years. it probably will not happen in the next 50 years. The liberals oppose tax cuts but they choose to cloak their opposition in the rhetoric of class warfare. Frankly. this rhetoric is giving me a headache. It is like listening to my daughter Mandys favorite music. The beat is simple. the volume is loud. but the ultimate contribution to society is meaningless. Mr. Chairman. we need less rhetoric for the Democrats regarding taxes and more illumination. Our tax cuts help working families in all stages of life. from those who have children to those who are grandparents. from those who wantto save for a retirement to those who want to invest in the future of America. Working families are not necessarily rich in wealth. but they are rich in spirit. The liberals believe that these people do not deserve tax relief. and I think that is pretty sad. So I just urge my colleagues to reject this weak substitute and vote for Americas first tax cut in 17 years.\n',i.appreciate chairman yield time rise opposition substitute support year taxpayer tax relief today bill overdue embrace tax relief minority embrace class warfare america work family force pay percent salary government high taxis costly regulation wonder take parent work other parent work family work ease tax burden minority leadership offer substitute more welfare come surprise member minority oppose bill ask liberal go support tax relief ask alien come happen last year happen next year liberal oppose tax cut choose cloak opposition rhetoric class warfare rhetoric give headache listen daughter favorite music beat simple volume loud ultimate contribution society meaningless need less rhetoric regard taxis more illumination tax cut help work family stage life child grandparent wantto save retirement want invest future work family rich wealth rich spirit liberal believe people deserve tax relief think sad urge colleague reject weak substitute vote first tax cut years.\n,105.0,daily,1,0

I rise today to offer an amendment to the Department of Defense authorization bill to express the concern of this body and condemnation of the recent Indian nuclear tests. Mr. President. this is a sense of the Senate. Before I go .into the provisions of it. let me state what I understand the facts to be. In the last 2 days. there have been five underground nuclear tests In India about 70 miles from the border of Pakistan. According to Prime Minister Vajpayee of India. there was a fission device. a lowyield device. and a thermonuclear device. According to the Carnegie Foundation. India is estimated to have approximately 400 kilograms of weaponsusable plutonium. Given that it takes about 6 kilograms of plutonium to construct a basic plutonium bomb. this amount would be sufficient for 65 bombs. With a more sophisticated design. it is possible that this estimate could go as high as 90 bombs. India also possesses several different aircraft capable of nuclear delivery. including the Jaguar. the Mirage 2.000. the MiG27. and the MiG29. India has 2 missile systems potentially capable of delivering a nuclear weapon: The Prithvi. which can carry a 1.000kilogram payload to approximately 150 kilometers or a 500kilometer payload to 250 kilometers. and the Agni. a twostage. mediumrange missile which can conceivably carry a 1.000kilogram payload as far as 1.500 to 2.000 kilometers. India. according to a report. has possibly deployed. or at the very least is storing. conventionally armed Prithvi missiles in Punjab very near the Pakistani border. Mr. President it is no secret that there are intense feelings between these two nations. Pakistan and India. up to late. have been very difficult adversaries. More recentlythis makes these detonations even more concerningI think there has been a kind of rapprochement. And we hopefully were seeing some improvement in the relations between these two countries. Mr. President. I can hardly think of a more important issue to the interests of the United States than preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. As the Secretary of State said the other day. this Nation has no other agenda than peace and stability throughout the world. And that. indeed. is an agenda to which. I believe this body can wholeheartedly subscribe. So each State that acquires nuclear weapons creates additional complications in maintaining international security. In south Asia today it appears to be too late to talk about preventing the acquisition of nuclear weapons. Both countries. India and Pakistan. now clearly have nuclear capability. And ultimately India must determine for itself whether its interests are best served by ridding South Asia of weapons of mass destruction or by turning the region into a potential nuclear battleground. That. I think. is no less the decision that has to be made. We all hope that India will choose the course of deescalation. of standing down. of beginning to reduce its nuclear arsenal and at the very least showing a willingness. now that these underground tests have been carried out. to sign the Nuclear NonProliferation Treaty. And. all of us saying to the Pakistani Government. please. we urge you not to respond in kind but to show that. indeed. Pakistan understands that greatness is not indigenous to nuclear production. I believe. in the long run. will bring inordinate credibility to the Government and the people of Pakistan. and the favorable response of this body as well. Mr. President. the amendment I submit today on behalf of Senators BROWNBACK. GLENN. BRYAN and myself essentially reports what has happened in the last 2 days. It then goes on to -say that it is the sense of the Senate that we condemn in the strongest possible terms the decision of the Government of India to conduct three nuclear tests on May 11 and two on May 13 and that we support the Presidents decision to carry out the provisions of the Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act of 1994 with respect to India and to invoke all sanctions therein. I might add that the author of that act is a distinguished Member of this body. none other than Senator JOHN GLENN of the great State of Ohio. And that is a rather comprehensive statement of sanctions that in fact can be placed on India. It will effectively terminate assistance to that country under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 except for humanitarian assistance or food or other agricultural commodities. It will terminate sales to that country of any defense articles. defense services or design and construction services. and licenses for the export to that country of any item on the U.S. munitions list. It will terminate all foreign military financing for 9iat country. and it will deny to that country credit. credit guarantees or other financial assistance by any department. agency or instrumentality of the U.S. Government. except that it will not apply to any transaction subject to the reporting requirement of title V or to humanitarian assistance. And it will oppose. in accordance with the International Financial Institutions Act. the extension of any loan or financial or technical assistance to that country by any international financial institution and prohibit anyU.S. bank from making any loan or providing any credit to the Government of that country except for loans or credits for the purpose of purchasing food or other agricultural commodities. Finally. it will prohibit exports to that country of specific goods and technology. My point in reading this. Mr. President. is that these. indeed. are strong sanctions. I believe all Members of this body are in support of the Presidents decision and this amendment gives us an opportunity to say so. The sense of the Senate also calls upon the Government of India to take immediate steps to reduce tensions that this unilateral and unnecessary step has caused. We express our regret that this decision by the Government of India will by necessity set back relations between the United States and India. and we urge the Government of Pakistan. the Government of the Peoples Republic of China and all governments to exercise restraint in response to Indian nuclear tests in order to avoid further exacerbating the nuclear arms race in south Asia. We call upon all governments in the region to take steps to prevent further proliferation of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles. and we urge the Government of India to enter into a safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency which would cover all Indian nuclear research facilities at the earliest possible time. Mr. President. this is the text and sum of this senseofthe Senate amendment before this body. I might say. for someone who has taken an interest in India. who has spent time with prior Ambassadors. both of India and Pakistan. attempting to reconcile differences between the two countries. that these tests come to me personally as a very low blow. I did not think we would see the day when the detonation of these nuclear devices would take place. However. that is now past. We have seen that day. We hope we learh from that. and we hope. most importantly. that the governments concernedIndia. Pakistan. and Chinaalso will recognize the fact that we in this body wish to do everything we possibly can to find consensus rather than animus. to put an end to the adversarial relationships. and to have sanity and soundness prevail when it comes to nuclear weapons.

I come to the House floor to talk about my bill H.R. 195. which is the Informed Choice Act. The results of a recent survey commissioned by Care Net of 802 female registered voters nationwide unequivocally demonstrate that women coast to coast. and from all walks of life. agree that providing ultrasound technology for womens health centers is an important and worthwhile cause. It is clear that these women view ultrasound as an essential resource for women who are faced with unplanned pregnancies and the related decision to either terminate or to continue that pregnancy. Nearly nine in 10. 87 percent of women. said it is important for nonprofit womens health centers to provide ultrasound services. including a considerable majority. 64 percent. who believe this is a very important priority. A majority of female registered voters believe that women facing crisis pregnancies would benefit from having access to ultrasound. Over half. 51 percent of those surveyed. said that women who are considering abortions should have access to ultrasound consistent with the rest of the prior to finalizing their decisions. In contrast. just 31 percent claim that seeing an image of what is inside would make such a decision more difficult. Mr. Speaker. it is clearly the belief of thesewomen that ultrasound provides understanding. not uncertainty. It is with this new information in mind that I remind my colleagues about my bill. H.R. 195. ""The Informed Choice Act."" I have introduced this legislation authorizing HHS to establish grants for which nonprofit health clinics could apply and. if awarded. purchase the needed ultrasound equipment. Many uninsured women are prohibited from finding the health care they need because the free health clinics to which they have access are unable to provide medical services because of the lack of funds to purchase such medical equipment. The mother is. therefore. forced to wander from one clinic to another in search of the services that she so desperately needs. Enabling these health clinics to purchase ultrasound equipment would be a persuasive push in the direction of transitioning from a health clinic to a medical facility. The advantages of ultrasound are many. It is fast and relatively cheap. costing about $50 per exam. Ultrasound exams are performed at about 10 to 14 weeks of the pregnancy and are considered the best way to gauge growth before birth. Ultrasound can diagnose heart problems in the unborn child. find neural tube defects including spina bifida. and determine the position of Splacenta. There is even now an ultrasound piece of equipment that can provide a 3D image that can rotate 360 degrees to see all sides of the baby. My legislation will ensure that doctors can provide critical information to mothers in the decisionmaking process regarding their pregnancies. Nothing in my bill makes ideology regarding abortion a condition for the grant. Whether a center offers abortion or abortion alternatives. the clinic is eligible so long as it meets the criteria set forth ih the bill. In the controversy today over abortion in America. emotionally charged rhetoric clouds the issue and does damage. I think. to the efforts made on behalf of mother and child. No matter ones conviction concerning abortion. we can all agree that the mother deserves as much information as is available in making this solemn decision. Information is the best weapon in diffusing the volatile discussion and returning us to our first concern. which is the health of the mother and child. The ultrasound equipment is a valuable tool in expanding the debate beyond traditional platitudes on both sides of the argument. Modern medicine has provided us with a window into the womb. These advances in technology empower women with as much information as possible regarding their pregnancy. The goal of my legislation is to provide women who find themselves with an unplanned pregnancy with the full scope of information such that they may finally make an informed choice. This bill is about the dissemination of information. The bill is about extending more free services to women and about making available this vital technology to the very poor women as well aa to the rich. So in conclusion. Mr. Speaker. there are times when people of good faith who differ on an issue can come together and find a place to agree. I believe my legislation. H.R. 195. brings us beyond the shrill arguments regarding abortion and makes a meaningful effort to care for the mother and the child.\n'",come floor talk bill result recent survey commission female register_voter demonstrate woman coast_coast walk life agree provide ultrasound technology women health center important worthwhile cause clear woman view ultrasound essential resource woman face unplanned_pregnancy relate decision terminate continue pregnancy percent woman say important nonprofit women health center provide ultrasound service include considerable majority percent believe important priority majority female register_voter believe woman face crisis pregnancy benefit have access ultrasound half percent survey say woman consider abortion access ultrasound consistent rest prior finalize decision contrast percent claim see image inside make decision difficult belief thesewoman ultrasound provide understanding uncertainty new information mind remind colleague bill introduce legislation authorize establish grant nonprofit health clinic apply award purchase need ultrasound equipment many uninsured woman prohibit find health_care need free health clinic access unable provide medical service lack fund purchase such medical equipment mother force wander clinic search service need enable health clinic purchase ultrasound equipment persuasive push direction transition health clinic medical facility advantage ultrasound many fast cheap cost exam_ultrasound exam perform week pregnancy consider good way gauge growth birth diagnose heart problem unborn_child find neural_tube defect include spina determine position ultrasound piece equipment provide 3d image rotate degree see side baby legislation ensure doctor provide critical information mother decisionmake_process regard pregnancy bill make ideology regard abortion condition grant center offer abortion abortion alternative clinic eligible meet criterion set ih bill controversy today abortion charge rhetoric cloud issue damage think effort make behalf mother child matter one conviction concern abortion agree mother deserve much information available make solemn decision information good weapon diffuse volatile discussion return first concern health mother child ultrasound equipment valuable tool expand debate traditional platitude side argument modern medicine provide window_womb advance technology empower woman much information possible regard pregnancy goal legislation provide woman find unplanned_pregnancy full scope information such make informed choice bill dissemination_information bill extend free service woman make available vital technology poor woman rich conclusion time people good faith differ issue come find place agree believe legislation bring shrill argument regard abortion make meaningful effort care mother child.\n,108.0,daily,1,0

They jeopardize fth health of pregnant women trying to get pre. natal care. They threaten the health of other women who are not even pregnant who are just trying to get medical care. Frankly. trying to keep a woman from seeing her doctor. for whatever reason. Is one of the most cowardly and despicable acts I can Imagine. There has been concern about whether this legislation restricts freedom of expression. which is protected by the first -amendment to our Constitution. I share that concern. because free expression and dissent are the foundations of our democracy. They are also absolutely essential to a healthy doctorpatient relationship. So I want to be very sure that any legislation we pass here will not bave unintended consequences lator on. And after careful analysls. I am convinced that t legIslation has been crafted to protect protesters. patients. and providers. No one who engages in peaceful. nonviolent proes ties anything to fear under this bill. But those would use force or. the threat of force should think twice now. because ts bill makes such Intimidation and harassment a Federal crime. Attorney General Janet Reo has written that such Interference ""lias gone beyond the legitimate expression of opposing views."" Even the Amercan Clvil Ubertles Union. which works to protect Just about every form of free speech ther Is. has endorsed this bill. It Is not free speech that Is threatened hereit Is womens health and lives. It Is nurses. doctors. and other health professionals whose mission is to heal. Let us be clear about H.R. 796: People can still conduct sltlns. demonstrate. shout. sing. pray. picket. .or proselytze. It would be foolish and unconstitutional to limit any of those activities. But it Is dangerous to keep people who need medical cam from getting It. and that is why this bill restricts only the most damaging activities: Protesters may not hurt people. They may not threaten people. And they may not physically""block women Irm getting the medical care they need. This legislation Is similar to a law enacted In my State of Washington esarier this year. it works in Washington State. and It will work throughout our country.

Governor EMERSON. There was one important feature upon which no agreemnt was reached. and that was in regard to the tributaries of the Colorado River in the State of Arizona. Arizona agreed to accept the specified division of water at Lee Ferry. That is quoted from page 310 of the printed and bound records of the hearings on House bill 5773. Before the same committee Commissioner Wilson testified: A good deal has been said with reference to the fact that California would not agree and said that their minimum was 4.600.000 acrefeet. The mistake that California made. in my estimation. was not to have come there with a trading margin. They came there with an irreducible minimum. prepared to support it as such. but they gave themselves no trading margin. On the other hand. Arizona came there with a cross section of the State. They had their conservatives. their radicals. their independents on their commission. and while we could not see what was going on behind their closed doors. we could Imagine. but when it came to a showdown they always came through together some way or other. Now. as to this 8.000.000 acrefeet. they said that they were not satisfied but they would accept it. placing upon it certain conditions. We met those conditions in the main. but the condition which they attached. that their tributaries should be released from the burden of the Mexican allocation which might be arrived at by treaty. that their tributaries should be free from that burden. we could not consent to. because in the compact there is no such distinction. the entire system. divided as I have read it to you. is subject to that burden when the United States reaches the point of determining by treaty with Mexico what Mexicos allotment or allocation should be. That is quoted from page 292 of the printed and bound record of hearings on House bill 5773. Commissioner Wilson on January 19. 1928. testified on the same subject before the Senate Committee on Irrigation and Reclamation as follows: At the Denver conference Arizona accepted the proposals of the governors of the upper basin States. on the allocation 0of water. but attached a condition to the effect that the tributaries of Arizona must be released and relieved from the burden which might be hereafter impressed upon them by virtue of any treaty between the United States of America and the Republic of Mexico. * * * * mte~osdr~ The upper basin governors gave the matter considerabie consideration and rejected Arizonas condition In this connection * * * That is quoted from page 193 of the printed and bound record of the hearings on Senate bill""728. I The Arizona Colorado River Commission. in reply to the proposal of the upper States. submitted in writing a document entitled "" Response of Arizona to Proposal of the Governors of the Upper Division. Colorado River Basin States. Which Was Submitted to the Lower Division States Under Date of August 30. 1927."" copy of which is found on page 349 of the printed and bound record of hearings on Senate bill 728. In such response the Arizona Colorado River Commission. referring to conditions attached to Arizonas acceptance of the proposal submitted by the four upper basin States. including the condition for the exemption of.Arizonas tributaries from any charge in meeting Mexican water demands. It is stated. in reference to these conditions: It must clearly be understood that It is only upon condition that they are resolved affirmatively that we will accept the first Item of the proposal relating to the allocation of water. The condition attached by Arizona to its acceptance of the proposal of the four upper basin States as to the division of water was rejected by those States. and therefore Arizonas socalled acceptance neither occurred nor could occur under the circumstances. Now. Mr. President. just a word or two in respect to water. It is a sad thing to me that in speaking of a division of the water of the Colorado River we speak of division be.tween the States. I think. unfortunately perhaps. in terms of peoples. There is no difference to me between the man who resides at Yuma just across the line between California and Arizona and the man who resides in the State of California just across the line between Arizona and California. They are men. human beings after all. and they are all entitled to some part of the water that may be necessary in order that they may follow that which has been their chosen vocation. These people are the ones that we want to keep in mind. in my opinion. rather than the impersonal entities to which we are constantly referring in discussing the division between the States. It may be unfortunate. too. Mr. President. that there are more people in the State of California utilizing water from the Colorado River than there are in the contiguous territory in the State of Arizona. It may be unfortunate. also. that the first and the earliest and by far the most extensive developments have been in the State of California. and that these developments in the State of California. particularly in the Imperial Valley. have become a pride not alone to the particular State of which they are a part. but a pride. too. for all the Nation. for down into the Imperial Valley. Mr. President. went a certain hardy class of pioneers originally who typified the highest and the best that there is in American life and American manhood. These men treked down there into the Imperial Valley when it was a barren waste. By their effort. by their work. by their constant striving they have made there of what was a sandy and a desert waste one of the fairest and most fruitful parts of all this world. and these people in the Imperial Valley have but one means of sustenance. namely. water. and water from the Colorado River. When these gentlemen speak of division of water between the States it seems to me they forget that there are in their State over at Yuma just the same sort of people as those in the State of California in the Imperial Valley. that those men and those women just across the line in Arizona are as much entitled to consideration as those across the line in the State of California. I never forget that fact. nor that those who have come there. who have. indeed. the prior right by virtue of lifes effort. are the people that we must protect in a division of water. and it is perfectly useless to say that you will divide water into halves when half of that water can not by any possibilityI speak advisedlybe used within any generation that is now existent or will be three generations hence in the State of Arizona. and when. on the other hand. in the State of California it is necessary for the very life of the pioneers who have gone there and who built up that great territory. It is useless. therefore. to say that you will divide waters in halves. That can not be done. You must divide your waters in accordance with necessities and in accordance with the actually existing rights that have been perfected by these various communities and these different peoples.\n'",true certain term committal important feature agreemnt reach regard tributary agree accept specified division water quote page print bind record hearing bill same committee testify good deal say reference fact agree say minimum acrefeet mistake make estimation come trading margin come irreducible_minimum prepared support such give trading margin other hand come cross section conservative radical independent commission see go closed_door imagine come showdown come way other acrefeet say satisfied accept place certain condition meet condition main condition attach tributary release burden mexican allocation arrive treaty tributary free burden consent compact such distinction entire system divide read subject burden reach point determine treaty allotment allocation quote page print bind record hearing bill testify same subject follow conference accept proposal governor upper_basin allocation 0of water attach condition effect tributary release relieve burden impressed virtue treaty mte upper_basin governor give matter considerabie consideration reject condition connection quote page print bind record hearing reply proposal upper submit write document entitle submit copy find page print bind record hearing bill such response refer condition attach acceptance proposal submit upper_basin include condition exemption tributary charge meet mexican water demand state reference condition understand condition resolve accept first proposal relate allocation water condition attach acceptance proposal upper_basin division water reject socalle acceptance occur occur circumstance word respect water sad thing speak division water speak division be.tween think term people difference man reside line man reside line man human_being entitle part water necessary order follow choose vocation people one want keep mind opinion impersonal entity refer discuss division unfortunate more people utilize water contiguous_territory unfortunate first early extensive development development become pride alone particular part pride go certain hardy class pioneer typify high good american life american manhood man trek barren waste effort work constant_striving make sandy_desert waste fair fruitful part world people mean sustenance water water gentleman speak division water seem forget state same sort people man woman line entitle consideration line forget fact come prior right virtue life effort people protect division water useless say divide water half half water possibilityi speak use generation existent generation other hand necessary very life pioneer go build great territory useless say divide water half do divide water accordance necessity accordance exist right perfect various community different peoples.\n,70.0,bound,0,1

The amendment finds that the Federal budget contains billions of dollars in payments. benefits and programs that predominantly assist profitmaking enterprises rather than provide a clear and compelling public benefit. Such largess can provide unfair competitive advantage to certain industries and industry segments and has become an enormous drain on the Treasury. And. the amendment expresses the sense of the Senate that the Congress should reform or terminate such programs in order to provide additional tax relief. deficit reductions. or achieve the savings necessary to meet the resolutions budget instruction. Mr. President. we are asking millions of Americansfrom families who receive food stamps to our men and women in uniformto sacrifice in order to stop the Nations fiscal bleeding. As a matter of simple fairness. we have a moral obligation to ensure that corporate interests share the burden. The Cato and Progressive Policy Institutes. have identified 125 Federal programs that subsidize industry to the tune of $85 billion every year. and PPI found an additional $30 billion in tax loopholes to powerful industries. The public cannot understand why we continue to shell out billions of dollars in subsidies to powerful corporate interests. when we simply cannot afford such largess. and at a time when many corporate CEOs are earning bonuses that resemble the budgets of many school districts. Corporate pork cannot be justified in such an environment and it has no place in a diminishing Federal budget. Some believe that corporate pork is a thing of the past. Sadly that is not so. While some gains were made this year in trimming the fat. the effort was been disappointingly anemic. We still subsidize the overseas advertising of multimillion dollar companies through the Marketing Promotion Program. hundreds of millions are earmarked for unrequested hometown military construction projects. we still coddle wealthy peanut and sugar growers with anachronistic production quotas and tariff restrictions. billions remain in the pipeline for highway demonstration projects which are not even considered priorities in the States where they will be built. And the biggest and most obscene example. we still plan to give away billions of dollars in publicly owned electromagnetic spectrum to affluent communications companies. and that list goes on and on. Last November. I offered an amendment along with Senator THOMPSON and others to eliminate and reform 12 of the most celebrated and egregious forms of corporate pork identified by CATO and PPI. The fact that 74 Senators voted against the amendment is ample testimony to the problem. Mr. President. corporate pork wastes resources. increases the deficit. distorts markets and has no place either in a free market economy or in a budget where we are asking millions of Americans to sacrifice for the good of future generations. As the Public Policy Institute observed. ""The President and Congress can break the current impasse and substantially reduce both spending and projected deficits * * * if they are willing to eliminate or reform scores of special spending programs and tax provisions narrowly targeted to subsidize influential industries."" ""If we are willing""? Thats the million dollar question. Mr. President. This amendment will determine where the Senate stands on corporate subsidies. and will serve as a springboard to make the changes necessary to regain control of the budget and restore the publics confidence in the budget process. Mr. President. a portion of this amendment crafted by Senator DOMENICI addresses the question of how asset sales should be treated in regard to budget scoring. The distinguished Senator from New Mexico will explain that particular language in his remarks. I thank Senator DoMENICI and I urge all Senators to support the amendment. Mr. President. to summarize. this amendment makes two changes to the Bumpers asset sales amendment. First. it would add language expressing the sense of the Senate that corporate subsidies should be reduced. The language states we should eliminate any unjustified corporate subsidies in the budget and use the savings for deficit reduction and tax relief. Second. in lieu of the Bumpers amendment. it would prohibit using asset sales to balance the budget. This amendment would prohibit the scoring of proceeds from asset sales that would lead to a financial loss by the Federal Government over the long run.\n'",amendment express sense issue profound importance american peoplethe reform elimination undue corporate subsidy budget amendment find budget contain billion_dollar payment benefit program assist profitmake_enterprise provide clear compelling public benefit such largess provide unfair competitive advantage certain industry industry segment become enormous drain amendment express sense reform terminate such program order provide additional tax relief deficit reduction achieve saving necessary meet resolution budget instruction ask million family receive food_stamp man woman_uniformto sacrifice order stop fiscal bleeding matter simple fairness moral_obligation ensure corporate interest share burden identify program subsidize industry tune year find additional tax loophole powerful industry public understand continue shell billion_dollar subsidy powerful corporate interest afford such largess time many corporate_ceo earn bonus resemble budget many school district corporate pork justify environment place diminish federal budget believe corporate pork thing past gain make year trim_fat effort anemic subsidize overseas advertising multimillion_dollar company hundred_million earmark_unrequested hometown military construction project coddle wealthy peanut sugar grower anachronistic production quota tariff restriction billion remain pipeline highway demonstration project consider priority build big obscene example plan give billion_dollar own electromagnetic_spectrum affluent communication company list go last offer amendment thompson other eliminate reform celebrated egregious form corporate pork identify fact vote amendment ample testimony problem corporate pork waste resource increase deficit distort market place free market economy budget ask million sacrifice good future generation observe break current impasse reduce spending project deficit willing eliminate reform score special spending program tax provision target subsidize influential industry willing s dollar question amendment determine stand corporate subsidy serve springboard make change necessary regain control budget restore public confidence budget process portion amendment craft address question asset sale treat regard budget scoring distinguished explain particular language remark thank urge senator support amendment summarize amendment make change asset sale amendment add language express sense corporate subsidy reduce language state eliminate unjustified corporate subsidy budget use saving deficit reduction tax relief lieu amendment prohibit use asset sale balance budget amendment prohibit scoring proceed asset sale lead financial loss long_run.\n,104.0,daily,1,0

While the lab today is working in a multitude of scientific and engineering areas. their major effort is still the enhancement of national security through the design. development. engineering and underground testing of nuclear weapons.

Dr. May has long been a participant in assuring that the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile is credible as a deterrent which is both modern and sufficient. A major concern of Dr. May is that deterrent credibility will evaporate rapidly if all weapons testing is ended. Dr. May stated that the constraints of the socalled 150 kiloton threshold test ban treaty are already affecting some U.S. modernization plans.

I include the article to be printed in full following my remarks since it is most important today to understand why a comprehensive test ban will not necessarily reduce the chances for proliferation.

870140802,S,19610922,81,Mr. LONG of Hawaii,Unknown,LONG,Hawaii,M,2495,2888,09221961.txt,13375,818,87096661,LONG,OREN,S,HI,M,D,,voting,"Mr. President. late last year the Senator from Alaska [Mr. GRUENINGI and I. as members of a special study group of the Senate Interior and Insular Affairs Committee. visited the Ryukyu Islands. We were interested in the Ryukyus principally because of the relationship between them and other islands under U.S. jurisdiction in the Pacific. Our interest concerned primarily our civil responsibilities in the Ryukyus rather than military or strategic matters. In Hawaii. we have about 32.000 people of Ryukyuan descent. They are among our most outstanding citizens. and we are proud of them. It was therefore with more than a routine interest that I traveled to the Ryukyus. which. although far away in terms of miles. are nevertheless close in heart to us in Hawaii. As a result of my trip. I gained some impressions and arrived at some recommendations on how the United States should meet its civil and moral responsibilities in the Ryukyus. I would like to share those impressions with my colleagues in the Senate. and respectfully urge them to give careful consideration to several suggestions for improving our relations with the wonderful people of the Ryukyus. First. I would like to give some background on the Ryukyus and our trip there. The Ryukyus consist of 3 major groups comprising about 63 islands stretching along 375 miles. The islands have a total area of 848 square miles and a population of 882.000. Okinawa is the largest of the islands. with an area of 454 square miles and a population of 682.900. U.S. occupation of the Ryukyus is probably unique. Prior to World War II. the islands were an integral part of Japan. Following Japans surrender. they were treated as a separate territory for purposes of U.S. occupation. By the Treaty of Japan. ratified by the Senate on April 28. 1952. the United States was granted sole administrative authority over the Ryukyus for an indefinite time. Article III of the treaty states. in part: The United States will have the right to exercise all and any powers of administration. legislation. and jurisdiction over the territory and inhabitants of these islands. Japan did not. however. specifically renounce ""all right. title. and claim"" to the Ryukyus as Japan did in respect to Korea. Formosa. and the Kuriles. Then Secretary of State Dulles described the arrangement as ""residual sovere*-nty."" The treaty does not. however. confer upon Japan any right to exercise any true sovereignty. Executive Order 10713 of June 5. 1957. assigned to the Secretary of Defense the responsibility of governing the Ryukyus. The order states. in section 2: In the exercise of this authority the Secretary of Defense shall encourage the development of an effective and responsible Ryukyuan Government. based on democratic principles and supported by a sound financial structure. shall make every effort to improve the welfare and wellbeing of the inhabitants of the Ryukyu Islands. and shall continue to promote the economic and cultural advancement of the inhabitants."" (22 Fed. Reg. 4007. 1957). There are two governments in the Ryukyus. Headed by the High Commissioner is the U.S. Civil Administration of the Ryukyu IslandsUSCAR--responsible for exercising the powers of administration granted by the Peace Treaty with Japan. USCAR has established a local central government. called the Government of the Ryukyu Islands--GRIorganized along democratic lines. The local government includes legislative. executive. and judicial branches. The strategic importance of the Ryukyus is obvious. They are located 400 miles east of the Communist China coast. 620 miles southeast of Korea. 970 miles south of Tokyo. and 920 miles north of Manila. Okinawa is the only western base in the western Pacific where no other government can impose any restrictions which could limit he effectiveness of our military forces. This factor cannot be overemphasized in considering the importance of the Ryukyus to U.S. security. It is likewise obvious that U.S. occupation of the Ryukyus for security purposes will continue for an indefinite time in the future. Our study group was interested in the Ryukyus principally because of the relationship between these islands and other islands under U.S. jurisdiction in the Pacific. Our point of interest therefore concerns primarily the civil responsibilities rather than military or strategic matters. In this connection. however. it should be kept in mind that a vital factor in maintaining security in the Ryukyus is the existence of a loyal and friendly local population. This is made clear by the Executive order of 1952. USCAR has done much to foster friendly relations. particularly through the establishment of the local GRI government. Evidence of our successful efforts was the local election held shortly before the study group visited Okinawa last year. ProAmerican candidates were chosen in what news reports described as a ""landslide"" vote of confidence in the United States. The maintenance of a congenial local population thus is in our own selfish interest. But it is a great deal more than that. It is another example of meeting a moral and humanitarian obligation for all the world to see. During our stay in Okinawa. from November 21 through 23. discussions were held with Lt. Gen. Donald P. Booth. high commissioner and commander general of the Ryukyus and General Booths representatives. Brig. Gen. John G. Ondrick. U.S. civil administrator. Seisaku Ota. Chief Executive of the government of the Ryukyu Islands. Tsumichiyo Asato. speaker of the legislature. officials of the University of the Ryukyus. and others. Our major interest involved the need for development of Ryukyuan economy and an easing of U.S. immigration restrictions on Ryukyuans. Of greatest interest among Ryukyuans is the effect of the socalled Price bill of the 86th Congress. The legislation as originally introduced by Congressman MELvIN PaICE of Illinois and by me in the Senate was intended to assure the Ryukyus of continuing U.S. support for the economy of the islands to permit longrange planning. The legislation proposed that up to $6 million of the U.S. Federal income taxes collected in the Ryukyus be earmarked for promotion of economic and social development in the Ryukyu Islands. Congress. however. amended the proposal to make it an authorization for an appropriation of up to $6 million a year for such purposes. (See H. Rept. 1517 and S. Rept. 1738. 86th Cong.. 2d sess.) The amended legislation was signed on July 12. 1960. and became Public Law 86629. Although the new law does not assure the continued availability of funds as originally proposed. it does for the first time officially and legally authorize appropriations for the economic and social development of the Ryukyus. Previously. such funds were not specifically authorized and therefore ran the risk of being blocked on a point of order by any Member of the House or Senate. Provision of the full $6 million annual appropriation for economic and social development in the Ryukyu Islands authorized by Public Law 86629. assumes particular importance in view of the economic. political. and moral implications involved. It is a harsh fact that the Ryukyuan economy is one of scarcity. begotten of a poverty of natural resources. aggravated by the perennial problems of natural disasters and intensified by one of the worlds most extreme population densities. The area has no mineral deposits of any significance. it has no economically exploitable hydroelectric power potential. no important deposits of natural gas. and not even any usable thermal springs. The Ryukyus are far from selfsufficiency in food production. Annual food imports exceed $28 million. including nearly 50.000 metric tons of rice. Ryukyuan farmers are making some advances in the expansion of cash crop production. notably pineapple. which is now their second principal export item. However. their major cash crop. sugar. can now supply only 21/2 percent of Japans 1.200.000metricton annual import demand. One major factor affecting agricultural production is the requirement by U.S. agencies to use about 16.500 acres or 17.4 percent of the arable land on the island of Okinawa. however. since the Ryukyuans are permitted to farm approximately 4.600 acres of this land. the actual loss in acreage available for farming is 12.6 percent. This is still a substantial loss to an already deficit area. Natural disasters. predominately typhoons and droughts. are common in the Ryukyus. Thirtyfour typhoons struck these islands during the period fiscal year 1953 through fiscal year 1960. with wind velocities as high as 175 miles per hour and precipitation up to 15 inches. Tremendous damages to public and private property have been sustained. In 1959 alone. three major typhoons resulted in an estimated $14.7 million worth of damage. The population density. twice that of Japan and 20 times that of the United States. averages nearly. 1.100 per square mile in all of the islands. and is over 5.000 persons per square mile of arable land on Okinawa Island. The ratio of population to farmland increased from 3.8 per acre in 1940 to 5.7 per acre in In addition to the dearth of natural resources there are huge deficits in basic economic facilities such as roads. bridges. harbor facilities. and land development. There are nearly 2.000 miles of roadwayexcluding farm roadsof which only 150 miles are paved. To accommodate the 32.000 vehicles that now travel Ryukyuan roadsin contrast to the 200 there before World War IIthere is an urgent requirement for paving and construction of roads and bridges costing some $44 million. This requirement can only be met on a longrange basis. The nature of the geography of the Ryukyus makes them almost completely dependent on their ports and harbors for commerce. fishing. and economic ties with other areas. These are also a principal key to the development of the economic potential of all the islands. At all of the 70 small ports. and 4 of the 8 large ports. cargoes and passengers must be lightered from large vessels to shore. This is a costly timeconsuming process. yet not so costly as the losses of vessel incurred from the lack of a harbor in typhoon weather. Retaining walls at the base of slopes and at the edge of the sea are vital to protect roads. agricultural land. and villages from the destructive forces of nature and to assist in development of land which is so vital in this densely populated area. Requirements for retaining walls are estimated to cost some $16 million. These are only some examples of the need to provide the full $6 million authorized annually by Public Law 86629 if there is to be effective progress toward economic stability. In addition there are the important areas of public health. education. and technical training. By helping to meet these needs in the Ryukyus. the United States stands to gain the political stability essential to insure freedom of military operation in most this important base in the Far East. Political stability there can be achieved only If there is economic progress and stability. From the moral viewpoint. we are responsible for the welfare of the 900.000 souls who became our wards through the fortunes of war. we have assumed this responsibility by adopting the treaty of peace with Japan. The American sense of fair play. now explicit in the law of the land and implicit in all our efforts in this area. dictates that we make every effort to improve their welfare and wellbeing. The needs are tremendous. our assistance should be the maximum reasonably defined. On the basis of my impressions as chairman of the special study group during our visit to the Ryukyus. I wish to make the following recommendations: First. That the Congress support as soon as possible the full appropriations authorized by Public Law 86629 for the social and economic development of the Ryukyu Islands. Second. That Congress approve legislation. already introduced in the Senate by members of the study group . to provide a quota of 100 a year for Ryukyuans who want to immigrate to the United States. Third. That the administration give careful consideration to the possibility of easing U.S. customs restrictions on goods from the Ryukyus. particularly those which are noncompetitive to U.S. products. I am sure that there are other steps which can be and are being taken to improve our relations with these friendly and loyal people in the Ryukyus. I particularly commend President Kennedy for appointing a special ""task force"" to visit the Ryukyus within the next few weeks to study conditions there. I had the pleasure earlier this week of discussing this assignment with Dr. Carl Kaysen. chairman of the task force. and Undersecretary of the Army Stephen Ailes. a member of the task force. They fully realize the importance of our responsibilities toward the Ryukyuan people. and I am indeed hopeful that they will be able to speed the steps which need to be taken. When we assumed by treaty the control of these islands for an indefinite period we assumed responsibility for the happiness and the social and economic wellbeing of the 800.000 people who live there and whose ancestors lived there for centuries. We are meeting that responsibility. but not as fully as we should. We can and should do a better job. This is our opportunity. This is our challenge.\n'",last year member special study group visit interested relationship other island jurisdiction interest concern civil responsibility military strategic matter people ryukyuan

And we wouldnt put the environment into the agreement. we would put it in a side letter. Maquiladoras would be taken care of. the Rio Grande would be cleaned up. Nothing happened because it wasnt in the agreement. It did not have the force of law of the United States Congress behind it. So when we came to this. we didnt seal the deal. We said to the President. we want that in there. The President talked to the Republicans. and back and forth it went.

Now. if somebody says theyre going to do something. you take them at face valuesure theyre going to do it.

Last year. former Energy Secretary Herrington recommended that two NPRs be constructed. one at the Savannah River site and the other at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory. At that time. many experts were convinced that the recommended plan was seriously flawed for two reasons. First. it assumed that the existing Savannah River reactors would operate reliably until a NPR was available. And second. it proposed the least timely. most expensive option in spite of the urgent need and the very real budget pressures we face. The events at Savannah River over the past year and the recent GAO study have confirmed these concerns. The other option to meet the Nations future tritium needs Is for DOE to acquire and finish the 63 percent complete Washington Nuclear Plant No. 1 LWNP1] reactor at the Hanford Nuclear Reservation. While DOE views WNP1 merely as a ""contingency."" the GAO report demonstrates that WNP1 is by far both the quickest and least expensive option. The GAO study also points out that revenues from the sale of steam or electricity would reduce the cost of an NPR but did not go into detail on the size of these revenues or the fact that in this use of WNP1. these revenues would be sufficient to acquire and complete the plant without any appropriated funds. Our Nation is now without a reliable source of tritium. The existing tritiurnproducing reactors at Savannah River were shut down more than I year ago for health and safety concerns. The seriousness of the problem we face has been clearly articulated by Secretary Watkins in numerous public remarks In which he has stated: There is a tritium shortage and we are getting to the limit of our ability to manage it without significantly impacting on our stockpile. The GAO report recognizes the critical importance of developing new sources of tritium to meet our future needs. but it uncovered a number of deficiencies with the selection process now being followed by DOE. Among the GAOs findings are: Cost estimates are ""inaccurate because DOE used unrealistic assump. tions"" in their development. and DOEs report ""does not provide clear information concerning the total timeframe necessary to construct and obtain tritium"" from the two recommended reactors. As Congress considers future fund. ing needs for the NPR Program. the GAO reaffirms that completing WNP1 would cost $1 billion less than constructing a new facility at Savannah River. Further. the net life cycle cost would be $7.6 billion less for WNP1. The savings are even greater when compared with the untested NPR technology proposed for Idaho. The GAO also concluded that: DOEs proposed tworeactor strategy has the added uncertainty of not yet having detailed reactor designs. without which It becomes very difficult to develop firm estimates. In other words. the projected costs to construct NPRs at Savannah River and Idaho. $3.2 billion and $4.8 billion. respectively. are extremely optimistc and likely to go much higher. With regard to completion schedule. the GAO report noted that the time needed for testing. producing and extracting tritium was not included in DOEs projections for Savannah River and Idaho. Instead of DOEs estimated 10 years to provide new production capacity. the GAO concluded that It will take at least 12.5 years to extract tritium at Savannah River and Idaho wont be able actually to produce tritiurn for at least 16 years. In contrast. the partially constructed WNP1 facility would take years to complete including tritium production and extraction. according to the GAO report. These conclusions mean that while our existing tritiumproducing facility at Savannah River faces continued problems and uncertainty. DOEs proposed strategy raises even more serious questions by ignoring the quickest. most costefficient option thats available. Congress will soon face tough decisions on NPR funding. This Senator feels it is imperative that every Member take a close look at the facts and then weigh the importance of the budget and national security Implications of this decision. Mr. President.

I speak in support of S. 3683. the area redevelopment bill. This measure has come before us after thorough consideration in committee. in fact. in two committees. The Committee on Labor and Public Welfare. which first had jurisdiction over the measure. spent considerable time on S. 2663. the predecessor of the current bill in the 84th Congress. The pending bill. S. 3683. received extensive consideration by the Banking and Currency Committee. The printed copies of the hearings are proof of that. I compliment my friend and colleague. the Senator from Illinois . for his untiring efforts in behalf of the area redevelopment bill. I have been pleased on both occasions to join him as a sponsor of the bill. In speaking for this bill. Mr. President. I also speak for the Governor of Michigan. the Honorable G. Mennen Williams. In testimony before the Labor and Public Welfare Committee in the 84th Congress and the Banking and Currency Committee in the 85th. Governor Williams spoke eloquently in behalf of the basic goals of this legislation. He agrees with me. I am sure. that it is in the best interest. not only of Michigan. but of the entire United States. to offer the assistance of the Federal Government to chronically depressed areas. We have such areas in my State of Michigan that unhappily accept this title. Believe me. the people who live there certainly do not want their area to be called depressed. They get no pleasure from such recognition. And. Mr. President. they have tried every way they know to get rid of that tagto restore prosperity to their areas. and to provide decent standards of living for themselves and their families. But try as they may. -they too often are unsuccessful in their effortsbecause of factors beyond their control. That is why we need this bill that is now before us. Today many of us may feel that just about the entire country is a depressed area. thanks to the recession that has left more than 5 million persons jobless. And many of us are working against considerable obstacles to use the power and the influence of the Federal Government to alleviate this tragic situation. The biggest obstacle. regrettably. Is a sense of complacency on the part of the administration. an administration which calls the current suffering a minor emergency. The administration apparently feels that the recession cannot last forever. It probably is right. The recession may turn into a depression before it ends. and millions more may be thrown out of work. but it probably will end sometime. But the point is. Mr. President. that even a return of general prosperity could well bypass certain areas of this country. as it has in the past. They have known the word ""depression"" and its terrible meaning far longer than the rest of the country. The area redevelopment bill will be a step toward aiding these areas to recover and enjoy the prosperity to which they are entitled in a great and expanding economy. I can understand some of the fears that have been voiced. by opponents to this measure. but I cannot agree with them. I cannot possibly agree that providing this limited aid to economically depressed areas will in any way hinder the development of new industrial areas elsewhere. This Nation did not achieve its greatness and its basic potential of unlimited prosperity by fighting over the crumbs of existing wealth. It achieved its greatness because of the inventiveness of the American mind and the toil of the American working men and women. and because we are always looking forward to the horizon. America also became great. Mr. President. because of an increasing understanding that there can be no such thing as prosperity for me. but not for you. Such selfishness could destroy our country. If we are to have a sound and expanding economy. and true prosperity. we must make the future of these less fortunate areas of the country the business of all of us. In conclusion. Mr. President. I realize that honest men may differ over the technicalities of a measure of this nature. and they may differ over the degree of urgency. But I hope all of us will agree that the suffering of innocent people in such areas of chronic unemployment and underemployment is the business of everyone. if America is to grow.\n'",speak support area redevelopment bill measure come thorough consideration committee fact committee jurisdiction measure spend considerable time predecessor current bill 84th pende bill receive extensive consideration printed_copy hearing proof compliment friend colleague untiring_effort behalf area redevelopment bill pleased occasion join sponsor bill speak bill speak testimony 84th_85th speak behalf basic goal legislation agree sure good interest entire offer assistance depress area such area accept title believe people live want area call depressed get pleasure such recognition try way know get_rid prosperity area provide decent standard live family try unsuccessful effortsbecause factor control need bill today many feel entire country depressed area thank recession leave more person jobless many work considerable obstacle use power influence alleviate tragic situation big obstacle sense complacency part administration administration call current suffer minor emergency administration feel recession last right recession turn depression end million more throw work end point return general prosperity bypass certain area country past know word depression terrible meaning rest country area redevelopment bill step aid area recover enjoy prosperity entitle great expand economy understand fear voice opponent measure agree agree provide limited aid depress area way hinder development new industrial area achieve greatness basic potential unlimited prosperity fight crumb exist wealth achieve greatness inventiveness american mind toil american work man woman look horizon become great increase understanding such thing prosperity such selfishness destroy country sound expand economy true prosperity make future fortunate area country business conclusion realize honest man differ technicality measure nature differ degree urgency hope agree suffering innocent people such area chronic unemployment_underemployment business grow.\n,85.0,bound,0,1

I wish to comment on the Economic Report of the President. which has been presented to Congress. This report is more significant for what it fails to say than for what it does say. It glosses over the fact that our economy has since 1956 been virtually standing still. That is a fact which requires some thoughtful consideration. At a time when we are facing the most unbelievable competition our Nation has ever been confronted with. we find ourselves with an economy which has been limping along. at times. stagnant. and all too often out of balance. This is no way for a great free society to challenge the Communist monolithic disciplined. socialist society. It will require. more than that if we are to maintain our leadership and our strength.. It is always reassuring to get good news and promises of improvements in. our economy. but the American people: are entitled to get the hard factsthat our economic growth rate is lagging far behind our capacity for growththat we are in danger of falling. behind the Soviet Union in military and economic power if we continue to let our economy limp along the way it is going. I might add that the policies of the Government have a great deal to do with the tempo of economic progress or retreat. The policies which have been pursued by the administration. of tight money. high interest rates. hard dollars. tight credit. and failure to effectively enforce the antitrust laws and to promote truly competitive enterprise. have taken their toll. The fact of the matter is that the United States of America. the richest nation. to be sure. on the face of the earth. has had the lowest rate of economic growth since 1952 of any of the industrialized Western nations. further than that. the lowest of any of the industrialized nations. less than Japan. less than France. less than England. less than Western Germany. less than the Scandinavian countries. less than Belgium and Holland and Italy. and far less. in terms of rate of growth. than the Soviet UnionI do not really believe that that is a record to be proud of. We have witnessed in recent years a Nation literally having its position of prestige and power and influence eroded away. I know that only recently the eminent columnist. Walter Lippmann. wrote a column which told this story in the most graphic and meaningful words. He said. in fact. that the President had been presiding over the liquidation of the great power and prestige and influence of the United States in this troubled world. Those are hard words. but I believe I properly paraphrase what Mr. Lippmann said earlier this week. 1 shall put into the RECORD in a moment. and bring to the attention of the Senate. a second item from this distinguished journalist. columnist. educator. and teacher. We need to distinguish between the healthy growth of economic muscle and the flabby bloat of inflation.

This is partly a ceremonial function that these men perform as an aide. This comes down from George Washington. the first Commander in Chief of the Continental Army. He had these perquisites. and every succeeding general or admiral in a comparable place or something below that comparable place of George Washington has had those perquisites. They have official duties to perform. they have official entertainment to perform. I am not making excuses for them. You are not going to pollute them. not this easily anyway. But this is a part of the protocol. I am not very familiar with it. I am not a general. and I have not been around many generals. but I know this is a part of the protocol. It is a part of the perquisites of these higher officersand. by the way. they are mighty scarce down in Mississippi. We have only two down there. So this is not a local matter with me at all. We have some training bases for the Air Force. Army and Navy. they have a lot of sunshiny days down there. But this is a serious matter. and this amendment just totally knocks all of them out. abolishes them as if it were something evil and sinful. which it is not at all. This aide service is something which encourages the wives to carry out their part all during these military careers. and they do have an essential part. It encourages them to perform their functions in the hopeful expectation of these promotions coming in time. and that they will have some of the things that go with the promotions. We can argue here till doomsday about the numbers. but my point is. let us not just abolish an institution. I do not know. I would settle for some number. But I really do not want to see this thing just abolished as if it were a punishment on the military. By the way. all these men are not friends of mine. but with all the shifting around and everything all of a sudden. we had to have a new chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. and that called for a new Chief of Staff of the Air Force. and I do not know when I have been any more favorably impressed than I have been with the new men who were sent in to fill those highly responsible roles. Their training started away back. One was a nonacademy man. made Chief of Staff of the Air Force. All their record of attainment. their reasoningI remember what Senator Carl Hayden told me when I first came to the Senate. He said: Spend your first two years learning how to be a Senator. They have spent all these 20odd years learning how to be top officers. and I was proud of them and I predict for both outstanding accomplishments. Now the Senator would come along and jerk the rug out from under them here. and they would not have anything to help them carry on. Every Senator on this floor who has taken part in the debate on this bill has had an aide here with him. if not two or three. Why? We have to have them. That is why they are here. They perform a highly important function. A Senator who tries to do everything himself is not much of a Senator. We have some abuse of this privilege. but all of our officers. now. are going to have to do all this entertaining and all this protocol and everything else. and if their wives have to do it all. we are going to find a great letdowna great letdown. a diminution of interest and in the attractiveness of the office. I just hope the Senate will not adopt this amendment. Let us not kill this thing that does have a meaningnot much to us. maybe. but it certainly means a lot to them.

I also want to thank my friend from California for introducing this Resolution 1457. and I am proud to be a cosponsor of this important resolution. The people of Iran are under the oppression of the little fellow from the desert. Ahmadinejad. And the little fella claimed that he won the election last year. but the whole world knows. including he. that he stole the election in Iran. The people of Iran want democracy. they want freedom. and so they took to the streets opposing the little fella. And what did he do? He retaliated. He used his henchmen. his goon squad to come out and brutalize his own people. who were unarmed but yet taking to the streets wanting freedom and a legitimate election. He injured them. he beat them. he hung them. and he shot them. peaceful Iranians wanting freedom and democracy. But the folks of Iran were not going to be intimidated by the crimes committed against them in their pursuit for freedom and a free election. so they have continued to speak out. By continuing to speak out. of course. more of them get arrested. As my friend from California mentioned. it includes everybody: Women and children. lawyers and journalists. They are all arrested. brutalized. and some are killed in the name of keeping the little fella. Ahmadinejad. in power in Iran. This past week in Paris. France. 100.000 people. mainly Iranians. marched in support of freedom and democracy for their homeland in Iran. And its important that we in America let everybody know where we stand when it comes to freedom versus tyranny. freedom versus a dictatorship. that we stand by the people of the nation who want selfdetermination and freedom. The Iranians kind of wonder where we stand as a Nation. They are concerned because. you see. they get their governmentcontrolled media and it tells them one thing. that the United States is not supportive. So we need to make it clear to them that we do support them. And they dont want weapons. They dont want armament. They dont want even money. They just want to know that this country. the center and hope for the world when it comes to human rights and democracy. stands with the people. the people of Iran in their quest to control their own destiny and control their own government. There is no freedom in Iran as long as this regime is in power and Ahmadinejad continues to be the dictator. the tyrant of the desert who threatens to destroy not only our ally Israel. but destroy the West as soon as he can get his hands on those nuclear weapons. He needs to go. His time has come. It needs to go. And the way that that can happen is when the people of Iran take control of their own country. The best hope for the Iranians. the best hope for the world. Madam Speaker. is for a regime change in Iran by the people of Iran. So we should support that endeavor. We should tell those freedomloving folks. those sons of liberty. those daughters of democracy. that we in America. halfway around the world. who believe in liberty and believe in democracy and believe in freedom. we stand with them. We support them morally. and we support them because they have the right to determine their own destiny. Our quarrel as a Nation is not with the people of Iran. Our quarrel is with this dictator. this tyrant. the little fellow from the desert who wants to destroy his own nation and the rest of the world as well. So I support this resolution and I want to compliment the gentleman from California for bringing this to the floor.

860141175,H,19590909,1598,Mr. KING of Utah,Unknown,KING,Utah,M,47393,47802,09091959.txt,14421,954,86099300,KING,DAVID,H,UT,M,D,2.0,voting,"Mr. Speaker. I am greatly concerned over Americas health. and this concern now prompts me to take the floor of this zreat legislative body. to say what I think needs to be said. Americas health is in danger. and if the warning signals apparent to all are not heeded. we risk physical and mental deterioration. and inevitable capitulation to the virile and more rugged peoples of the world. It is true that life expectancy from birth in America has increased from a span of 47 years in 1900 to 65 years for males and 72 years for females. in 1959. In other words. if we could designate such a thing as an average boy baby. that baby could expect to live some 18 years longer if he were born in 1959 than he could have expected. had he been born in 1900. It is also true that this average boy baby will probably grow to be 2 or 3 inches taller than his grandfather. and perhaps a little heavier. These statistics. which are generally known. lead to the false impression that we are a more healthy. robust. and virile generation of people than were our ancestors. This increase in longevity. however. results from the impressive advances made in obstetrics and pediatrics. which have considerably reduced the rate of infant mortality. We have also made phenomenal progress in controlling the spread of contagious diseases. through a better understanding and elimination of their causes. However. it should be noted that the set of statistics which shows that our life expectancy has jumped from 47 years to 65 years. also shows that once a man has reached the age of 63. the chances of his life being substantially prolonged are no better now than they were 50 years ago. and the chance of his life being cut short by one of the wellknown chronic degenerative diseases is substantially higher than it was 50 years ago. In May 1955. Dr. Paul White and Dr. Norman Jolliffe. eminent scholars in their field. reported to Congress that the United States was one of the most unhealthy countries in the world in regard to coronary heart disease. The incidence of heart disease among men from 45 to 65 years. they said. was two to three times higher in the United States than in England. France. Germany. Italy. or Spain. In a paper in the New York State Medical Journal. dated September 15. 1955. Dr. Jolliffe continued his report by stating that ""although in America today. life expectancy at birth is near the best of any civilized country in the world. at the age of 40. life expectancy is near the bottom."" On July 24. 1957. Dr. W. Coda Martin. president of the American Academy of Nutrition. appeared. and testified before the Subcommittee on Health and Science. of the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce. During the course of his testimony. Dr. Martin submitted a copy of his report on the ""Health of the Nation."" for incorporation into the record. This report showed that according to the Cancer Institute. the incidence of cancer in the United States is growing alarmingly every year. Today one person out of every three in this country will probably develop cancer in some form before he dies. In 1940. the estimate was only one out of four. It was noted that there has been a sharp upturn in the number of occurrences of cancer among children. In 1923. cancer among children was a rarity. Today. cancer in children and babies. at birth. is a frequent occurrence. Recently. Boston opened the first hospital in the United States exclusively for the treatment of children with cancer. It is estimated that there are 500.000 new cases each year at all ages. The fact of the progressive deterioration of the condition of our health has been confirmed. according to the above report. by various scientifically conducted health surveys on groups of apparently healthy people. A checkup of 500 business executives. for example. whose average age was 48 years. at the University Hospital at Ann Arbor. Mich.. revealed that 41 percent of them suffered from physical diseases of which they were not aware. and 77 percent of these healthy men had some form of physical abnormality. Only 23 percent were in good physical health. Dr. Martin. in his testimony before the above subcommittee. made the further statement: This health problem is not confined to the older age group. In 1953. Draft Director Lewis B. Hershey stated that the Nation may be ""out of manpower"" In the next 2 to 3 years. If the present physical standards are not lowered. At that time. 1.700.000 men out of 4 million examined were rejected as unfit for service. Since then. rejections have reached to approximately 52 percent. If I were to continue to itemize and tabulate the dreary statistics covering allergic diseases. nervous disorders. arteriosclerosis and degenerative heart diseases. arthritis. epilepsy. and all of the other gloomy categories of human woes and ailments. I would come to the conclusion that well over half of our entire population is afflicted with some type of a chronic disease. I must acknowledge that I lay no claim to special insight into the answers to this frightening problem. There are many gifted scientists who have spent their entire adult lives in exploring the fields of pathology. and who avoid dogmatism on the matter of causation. Nevertheless. from what study I have done. and basing my opinion solely upon the conclusions of dedicated men of science who do qualify as experts. I am convinced that the contaminatives. additives. and toxic chemical compounds taken into the human body in connection with our regular food and drink. are in large measure responsible for the deplorable deterioration of our national health. I baya neither the ability. nor the space. to brief the abundance of technical literature available on this subject. Perhaps I may quote again. however. from the abovereferredto report of Dr. Martin. as reported in the subcommittee hearings of July 24. 1957. There are many approaches to the prevention and treatment of such complex diseases. but there appears to be one common denominator as the basic cause of degenerative diseases. That one factor is malnutrition. Referring specifically to the chemicals which are added to the foods we eat. Dr. Martin said: I also believe that the absorption of these toxic chemicalsand there are 704 different chemical compounds used in foods. and 150 of them have never been adequately checked for their toxic effects on humansover a long period of time can cause serious tissue damage. which inevitably terminates in a degenerative disease. Many of these chemicals. although apparently nontoxic. have no nutritional value and do not serve a useful purpose for the consuming public. Their continued use. therefore. constitutes a calculated risk to human health. if not life itself. The first line of defense must be to protect the health of the consumer. otherwise. the longrange calculated risk is that this country will become a Nation of invalids. weak in body and mind. * * * The human body can utilize only natural foods as nourishment and survive. Chemicals are not food elements. Therefore. they can produce only negative or harmful results. even though they are by scientific analysis nontoxic. It is then only a question of how much harm they will produce. when used to replace essential food elements in our diets. When the American housewife wheels her cart around the supermarket. she is only dimly aware. if at all. that it is almost impossible for her to purchase any article of food that has not had chemicals. bleaches. preservatives. additives. dyes. adulteratives. and other foreign substances added to It. She very likely does not know that many of those chemicals. whose function it is to increase eyeappeal. have never been tested by the Food and Drug Administration. and that although the latter lists many of them as ""probably safe."" there also are many additives about which it knows absolutely nothing. and that it will not be able. at the present rate of investigation to adequately test these additives for many years to come. By that time. there will likely be a brandnew crop of chemical compounds to take their place. Until last year. the law was so worded that any new chemical compound which was not a known poison. could be added to any food for consumption. and the burden then fell upon the Food and Drug Administration to prove that these foreign substances were deleterious to human health. This proof was difficult to adduce. from a legal point of view. even when immediate toxicity could be demonstrated. But It wa l. most Impossible to do Whvn the toxicity of tho chc~ical C61hpound was of such a nature that it could not be detected until after the expiration of many years. Because of the outstanding work of the Delaney Commission. the food additive amendment was passed last year which requires food processors to submit to the FDA the results of their tests on new chemical compounds. But the law is still filled with loopholes. It seems to me that It takes only a slight leap of the imagination on the part of the American housewife to grasp the proposition that where the incidence of degenerative diseases such as cancer. arteriosclerosis. and degenerative heart disease suddenly increases. and apparently for no known reason. and where it is shown that contemporaneously with such increase there occurs a phenomenal increase in the total amount of chemical compounds consumed. then there may well exist a causal connection between these two phenomena. I am quite aware of the fallacy of oversimplification. and I fully recognize the probability of a multiplicity of causes in any phenomenon as complex as disease. What I do say. however. is that the everincreasing scientific evidence renders it highly probable that the invariable concurrence of disease and body contamination by the consumption of toxic chemicals is more than coincidental. It is apparent that this entire subject requires a thorough investigation. The health. and maybe even the very survival. of the American Nation is at stake. Our laws on nutrition are loose and inadequately drawn. Public knowledge is fragmentary. and riddled with misinformation and discarded dogmas. The means of disseminating information on this subject are inadequate. My illustrious colleague from New York. the Honorable JAMsS J. DELANEY. has pioneered in this field for many years. and has uttered many strong words on this vital subject. I commend this distinguished gentleman for his wellknown work. and offer to join hands with him in his efforts. The American people owe him a debt of gratitude. The work of his outstanding Commission in 1952 made a significant contribution on the basis of which subsequent legislation has been enacted. Since 1952. when the Delaney Commission concluded its investigation. a flood of new chemical combinations have come on the market. I feel that a further Investigation is urgent. I am convinced that the whole field of chemical additives should be made a subject of continuing investigation. A bill has just been signed Into law to investigate the effect of chemical sprays on fish and wildlife. and yet we spend almost nothing to investigate the effect of chemicals on human beings. Mr. Speaker. on September 8. I introduced a bill. H.R. 9150. designe4 to create a nonpartisan commimion to further investigate tha entire subject of food and betrV e contamination. I have recommended that this Commission be appointed strictly on a nonpartisan basis. that It be patterned after the Hoover Commission. composed of nine experts in the field of toxicology. nutrition and biochemistry. Three of these men will be appointed by the President of the United States. three of them by the majority and minority leaders of the Senate. and three by the Speaker and minority leader of the House. It will be the function of these men. assisted by their staff. to thoroughly investigate this matter of food chemicals and additives. There are many legitimate points of view in the world. and all points of view on this subject should have full opportunity to be heard. Their findings should represent the combined wisdom of all of the great minds in this and other countries. in the field of nutrition. This should therefore be the most authentic and authoritative voice on the subject in all the world. The report will carry with It such recommendations as the Commission feels impelled to make. and Congress would do well to give careful consideration thereto. There has been much said about the matter of fluoridation of drinking water. As in the case of food additives. there is a plenitude of controversial literature on the subject. I. personally. feel strongly that because of the great controversy which accompanies the use of fluorides in drinking water. it would behoove this Nation to await a thorough investigation of the entire matter before further promoting this practice. It Is my desire that the Commission of which I speak should also investigate the scientific concept of fluoridation of water. It is true that there have been other bodies and commissions which have investigated this question before. but many of them have been motivated by a desire to prove. either that fluoridation is good or that it is bad. Too often the Investigation has been conducted in a spirit of partisanship. I propose that the investigation be made by a commission that has not prejudged the issues in any way. but that is interested only in ascertaining the true facts. It seems to me that the findings of such a commission will be authoritative throughout the country. and will help to guide the thinking of the many municipalities who are confronted by the problem of fluoridation. And so. the American Nation has come a long way from the days when it was content to sit down and eat humble fare. transmitted to the kitchen direct from the hand of its Creator. touched only by the magic of natures inscrutable chemistryimple food. unpampered. and undevitalized. The rugged life and simple diet of the American pioneer have gone. We have replaced them with the unwholesome living of the modern sophisticate. America would do well to reread the admonition of the Apostle Paul to the Corinlthians: ""Know ye not that ye are the temple of God. and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you? If any man defile the temple of God. him shall God destroy. for the temple of God is hl1y. which temple ye are""-I Corinthians 3: 16. 17.\n'","concerned health concern prompt take floor zreat

In addition. it creates an opportunity that gives us a cause for optimism. The bill will give the President an opportunity to appoint men of high caliber and integrity. The need for such men is particularly acute in the South. where men of meritlike Judge Tuttlehave too often been the exception. and men like Judge Cox the rule. This bill would create four new positions on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. 1 district judge for Alabama. 2 for Mississippi. 4 for Louisiana. 4 for Florida. 3 for Texas18 new judgeships in all in the Fifth Circuit. I hope and trust that President Johnson will use this opportunity to appoint men who respect the Constitution and recognize the supremacy of Federal law. CXII-----288Part 4 The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals is possibly the second most important judicial body in the country. Except for the U.S. Supreme Court. no other court has such an important role in any area as this courts increasing responsibilities in the area of civil rights. Through its decisions. its powers of supervision over lower courts. and the participation of its members on threejudge courts. the Fifth Crcuit Court of Appeals carries the major burden of applying legislation to assure equal rights to all Americansthe most important mandate in our history. It is imperative that judicial appointments to the circuit and district courts be made in harmony with the mandate of Congress and the Supreme Court. Unfortunately. there have been too many segregationistminded judges appointed. In all of the six States encompassed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. Negroes are a major population group. Tragically. they are also the most distinct group with the most urgent common interest under the laws of the United States. Yet. there is not a single Federal judge in the Deep South today who is a member of the Negro race. Last year. when I testified in opposition to the appointment of James P. Coleman to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. I urged the selection of a Negro for that seat. Now. under this bill. the President will have the opportunity to find competent and qualified lawyers for the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals and the district courts. I am positive that there are many competent and qualified Negro lawyers in the South who will make excellent judges and render conspicuous judicial service. Certainly they will not bear the responsibility for having been architects or defenders of the southern pattern of segregation. In addition. in other parts of the country the President will have the opportunity to increase the number of Negro judges on the Federal bench. As far as I know. among 384 judges there are only 5 Negroes presently serving in the circuit and district courts. Recently the President named Manhattan Borough President Constance Baker Motley to the District Court for the Southern District of New York. which was a commendable appointment. There should be more. Mr. Chairman. this bill. which would create 45 additional Federal judgeships. will also create an opportunity. which I sincerely hope the President will seize. to reshape the Federal judiciary in the South. Judges who understand and respect the law of the land and who are creative in applying the law can do much to advance the cause of civil rights. The Civil Rights Acts of 1964 and 1965 which we passed provide the legal framework for the achievement of full equality. How these laws are interpreted and applied is crucial.\n',say creation additional judgeship insure justice do give individual judge more time reflect decision addition create opportunity give cause optimism bill give opportunity appoint man high caliber integrity need such man acute man meritlike exception man rule bill create new position district judge new judgeship hope trust use opportunity appoint man respect recognize supremacy federal law second important judicial body country other court important role area court increase responsibility area civil right decision power supervision low court participation member threejudge_court carry major burden apply legislation assure equal right important mandate history imperative judicial appointment circuit district court make harmony mandate many segregationistminde judge appoint encompass negro major population group distinct group urgent common interest law single federal judge today member race last year testify opposition appointment urge selection seat bill opportunity find competent qualified lawyer district court positive many competent qualified lawyer make excellent judge render conspicuous judicial service bear responsibility have architect defender southern pattern segregation addition other part country opportunity increase number judge bench know judge serve circuit district court name commendable appointment more bill create additional judgeship create opportunity hope seize reshape federal judiciary judge understand respect law land creative apply law much advance cause civil right act pass provide legal framework achievement full equality law interpret apply crucial.\n,89.0,bound,0,1

There were 113 Senate amendments. There are five of those amendments constituting a group known as the ""Clark amendments"" and to which the House conferees disagreed in conference. and we have brought them back to the House without including them in the conference report. Of the remaining 108 Senate amendments. about 50 percent of them were agreed to by the House. and the Senate receded on about the other 50 percent. with some amendments to certain of those Senate amendments. Most of the amendments are purely clarifying. You will appreciate the fact that the drafting service which serves the House also serves the Senate. We pass a bill first. and they have a little more time when they go before the Senate committee to improve the language. Many of the amendments are simply to improve the language. In other words. they are clarifying amendments. I am not going to take your time with those. There are certain outstanding Senate amendments upon which the conferees of the House have agreed and to which I wish to call your attention. The first of these is the socalled ""Russell amendment."" You will recall that under the oldage assistance plan. as passed by the House. the Federal Government contributes dollar for dollar to State pension funds to the extent of $15 per person per month. In order for a State to get any of this Federal contribution. the State must have a Statewide pension plan and must put that plan into operation. and then the Federal Government matches whatever amount the State puts up. to the extent of $15 per person per month. The Russell amendment grew out of the fact that certain States have constitutional prohibitions against a State pension plan. So the Senate adopted amendment no. 4. on page 5 of the bill. That amendment. in brief. provides that any State. for a period of 2 years. which does not have a pension plan approved by the socialsecurity board and under which it can secure Federal contribution or Federal assistance. may receive from the Federal Government during that first 2 years. $15 per person for qualified citizens of a State. qualified under the provisions of the act to receive oldage pensions. For instance. the socalled ""Russell amendment"" provides that the Federal Government shall contribute the entire amount of pensions to needy aged persons in those States that are not under a State pension plan. and that the amount so paid shall be $15 per month to each person in such States who can qualify under the provisions of this act.\n'",conferee socialsecurity bill agree amendment controversy socalled amendment amendment amendment know black amendment amendment amendment constitute group know amendment conferee disagree conference bring include conference report remain amendment percent agree recede other percent amendment certain amendment most amendment clarify appreciate fact drafting service serve serve pass bill little more time go committee improve language many amendment improve language other word clarify amendment go take time certain outstanding amendment conferee agree wish call attention first socalled amendment recall oldage_assistance plan pass contribute dollar dollar state pension fund extent person month order get contribution statewide pension plan put plan operation match amount state put extent person month amendment grow fact certain state constitutional prohibition pension plan adopt amendment no page bill amendment brief provide period year pension plan approve socialsecurity board secure federal contribution federal assistance receive first year person qualified citizen qualified provision act receive oldage_pension instance socalled amendment provide contribute entire amount pension needy aged person pension plan amount pay month person such state qualify provision act.\n,74.0,bound,0,1

In the past wars have been fought with only a fraction of a nations effort. Not so with this war. True we have not asked for women to arm and fight. but in recent wars. especially this one. we are calling upon women more and more for their definite part in the war. even if it is not for combat service. In our War between the States we called upon banks and rich citizens to lend money to finance the Government. but during the World War we included a larger number of citizens. even selling war stamps to children in financing that war. Today we are broadening the financial support of the present war. just as we are including a larger percent of the population in carrying out the war effort. Total war does not mean 50 percent of effort. nor 60 percent. but 100 percent. Therefore. it is logical that we should not only rely upon big businessmen. but upon many. many more small businessmen. with the big fellows. to carry on total war production. Of course. we cannot legislate specifically in all necessary detail. Therefore much of the effectiveness of this measure will depend upon the discretion and wisdom of those who administer it. One reason why I asked awhile ago whether the language incorporated in the bill would restrict its application to the conversion of small plants to war production. or whether it also applied to establishment of new plants. if found to be needed and likely effective. Much depends upon whether this applies to new plants. For instance. there are some things almost as vital to our war effort as are guns and ammunition. but which we have heretofore been importing and now we can no longer import them. Now. let us take rubber as an illustration- Of course. we are prcducing synthetic rubbpr. but it is a process involving big business to do it well under our present processes. However. let us assume that a method of producing rubber were known such as thousands of small businessmen in many States of our Union could produce it with a little encouragement. Would it not be the part of wisdom for this law to be to administered. as to give them that encouragement? I am assuming that the language of this bill might properly be interpreted in administering it so as to include establishment of many such small plants. Now to take another case. What is more needed than burlap fabric? The secretary of the Wool Growers Association in Arizona called on us frantically a short time ago for many thousand burlap bags for the Arizona wool clip. Later a farm organization in Arizona was equally urgent in calling for 350.000 burlap bags to take care of the grain crop. The Army needs burlap bags for sand bags and many other purposes. but we are not importing burlap fabric from India or elsewhere. What is more needed by the Navy than rope. or by the grain farmers than binder twine? Yet have you tried to buy any rope lately? If it could be shown that there is an abundance of fiber suitable for making rope and suitable for burlap fabric growing in about half a dozen States of our Union. and also that there is an economically feasible process of converting this fiber into the needed finished -product on a small scale by what would be called small business concerns in many localities. would it not be a part of wisdom. and permissible under this measure. to give such small operators initial encouragement to establish such factories? I believe so. and I further believe that those who may be named to administer this act will feel the same way about it. In regard to producing rubber I use a hypothetical case. but there is nothing hypothetical about my second illustration. that of hard fiber for rope andsoft fiber for burlap fabric. Certainly in the great States of Texas. New Mexico. Arizona. Nevada. and California there are millions of tons of desert growth which might be readily converted to fill these vital war needs. I feel that the language of the bill. as explained by the chairman of the committee. can be logically interpreted by those who administer it so as to make such production possible.\n',comprehend full meaning total war past war fight fraction nation effort war true ask woman arm fight recent war one call woman more definite part war combat service war call bank rich citizen lend money finance include large number citizen sell war stamp child finance war today broaden financial support present war include large percent population carry war effort total war mean percent effort percent percent logical rely big businessman many many more small_businessman big fellow carry total war production legislate necessary detail much effectiveness measure depend discretion wisdom administer reason ask language incorporate bill restrict application conversion small plant war production apply establishment new plant find need effective much depend apply new plant instance thing vital war effort gun_ammunition import import let take rubber illustration- prcduce synthetic rubbpr process involve big business present process let assume method produce rubber know such thousand small_businessman many state produce little encouragement part wisdom law administer give encouragement assume language bill interpret administer include establishment many such small plant take case need burlap fabric secretary call short time many burlap_bag wool_clip farm organization urgent call burlap_bag take care grain crop need burlap_bag sand bag many other purpose import burlap fabric need rope grain farmer binder_twine try buy rope show abundance fiber suitable make rope suitable burlap fabric grow dozen state feasible process convert fiber needed finished -product small scale call small business concern many locality part wisdom permissible measure give such small operator initial encouragement establish such factory believe believe name administer act feel same way regard produce rubber use hypothetical case hypothetical second illustration hard fiber rope fiber burlap fabric great million ton desert growth convert fill vital war need feel language bill explain chairman committee interpret administer make such production possible.\n,77.0,bound,0,1

I rise today on behalf of the more than 47 million Americans who rely on nutrition assistance and in strong opposition to the deep. unnecessary. and cruel cuts to these antihunger programs in the FARRM Bill. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program is one of our Nations most effective tools for lifting children. seniors. and families out of poverty and helping vulnerable Americans put food on their table each day. SNAP is a lifeline for lowincome and working Americans and their families. Mr. Speaker. I speak in defense of the most basic elements of Americas safety net. that regardless of circumstance. no American should go hungry. These deep and drastic cuts mean that 2 million Americans risk falling through the safety net. Some 210.000 children may go hungry throughout the school day. an additional 850.000 households will have less food on their tables. In my home State. nearly 1 million south Floridians dont know where their next meal will come from. and an astonishing 300.000 of them are children. It is inexcusable for this Congress to try to balance the budget on the backs of hungry children and their families. We know that savings derived from these cuts are shortlived. When Americans are food insecure. they are more likely to be anemic and have vitamin A and protein deficiencies. all of which lead to larger and more costly health issues. which we all pay for. When needy children go off to school on empty stomachs. we dim their horizons and cripple their potential. We are hurting our Nations future through these severe burdens on needy families. This is not the way to find a balanced budget approach. Unfortunately. these cuts define the mindset of too many of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle. It is shameful for us to tell the American people that when they fall on tough times. theyre on their own. With these cuts. we are limiting their potential. risking their health. and leaving our fellow Americans writhing with hunger. It is immoral. The authors of this bill should be ashamed.

Senator ROBERT C. BYRD. and others. including those of us who are members of the Committee on Labor and Human Resources. is nonpartisan effort. It gives us the opportunity to commit ourselves again to a program for the older citizens of America. for those who even at the years that are called advancing. are able to do constructive work within the communities where they live. helping others of their age brackets and some older and some younger. It is practical. it is needed. and it reflects a spirit of cooperation within this body that we adopt Senate Resolution 340 today. Expressing the sense of the Senate that we will continue to support title V of the Older Americans Act. The senior community services employment program funded under title V is a vital effort permitting the ablebodied elderly in their own communities to finds Jobs. doing worthwhile work for which they are paid a small stipend to help supplement their meager incomes. The small payment received by these individuals is not the reason the program Is important. It Is important because these senior citizens who are able bodied are working to help other seniors who are not. for one reason or another. able to help themselves due to age. illness. or disability. Senior companions assist others in their homes or provide transportation to senior nutrition sites for adequate meals. They also help individuals keep doctors appointments and get to their local grocery stores. or do their shopping for them. This program. though authorized under the Older Americans Act. is administered by the Department of Labor. The Labor Department recommended to the President that no funds be made available for title V in fiscal year 1983. The President accepted that recommendation and did not request funds for the program in his budget request. Passage of this resolution. Mr. President. is important and imperative in order to let our seniors who depend on these Jobs and services that they are not forgotten and we will not permit the program to be terminated for lack of funding. Members of this body from both sides of the aisle are Joined together on this resolution in recognition of the seniors who work in these Jobs for rewards that are small In terms of money. but loom large in terms of the community services they provide. Mr. President. when you are on small. fixed incomes as most of the elderly people in this country are today. any dollars earned to supplement that income can mean the difference be. tween eating and not eating. For the people they serve. there is no substitute. Mr. President.

(The following paragraph was delivered in Spanish.) Mr. Speaker. a lot of people have come to this floor in recent weeks to talk about NAFTA. And several of those Members have talked about what is going on in my district. El Paso. TX. Tonight. I want to talk about my district. The reason I have opened my remarks in Spanish. Mr. Speaker. is because it is important to the story that I want to tell my colleagues this evening. The district that I represent. El Paso. TX. has experienced more NAFTArelated job losses than any other community in the country. more than 5.600 jobs. This week. a delegation of dislocated workers from my district. who call themselves the La Mujer Obrera. or The Working Woman. are here in Washington. DC to tell theik story and share it with Members of Congress and administration officials. They are here this evening in this House to listen to my remarks. La Mujer Obrera is a communitybased. nonprofit organization dedicated to working to improve the social and economic conditions of lowincome Hispanic workers and their families in the El Paso area. Many of these workers had jobs in El Paso in the garment industry. And as most of my colleagues know. a lot of those jobs have now gone to Mexico. leaving these workers and others like them without jobs and with*out the skills needed to get new ones. When Congress passed NAFTA. it provided training assistance for workers dislocated by NAFTA. The workers of the La Mujer Obrera in El Paso were eligible for training assistance. What they got instead was remedial English lessons. It is important to understand that many of the people I am talking about have been working and paying taxes for 20 and 30 years. While you and I probably agree that. the ability to speak English will help. it will not by itself secure jobs for these workers. Since I became a Member of Congress 6 months ago. I have been working with La Mujer Obrera and the Texas Workforce Commission to provide the kind of assistance that will make a difference. As a result. a pilot project was launched in El Paso that we hope should effectively address the needs of dislocated workers. This pilot project will provide bilingual job training and prepare dislocated workers for new jobs. Approximately 1.200 dislocated workers will benefit from this project. Some Members of this body will listen to the story of La Mujer Obrera and conclude that NAFTA is bad. Others will point to the fact that the new jobs have been created by NAFTA and conclude that NAFTA is good. I think the truth lies somewhere in between. NAFTA was and is a bold initiative. But as with all great experiments. we should not be surprised.when we hit some problem spots. We must be willing to make corrections along the way. This is especially true when it affects people like Armida Arriaga. a 56yearold woman in El Paso who worked in the garment industry for 18 years before losing her job. Ms. Ariaga has used the NAFTA benefits. but she would rather have a job. In a recent report. the Forum for International Policy. whose members include Brent Scowcroft. Carla Hills. Colin Powell and Robert Strauss. said it best: ""Increased international trade may well lead to U.S. job losses for certain companies in certain sectors. The response should not be to impede greater trade. but rather to develop effective programs to provide American workers with training to acquire new skills and develop new business. Of course. meeting this challenge cannot be underestimated. Some workers may find developing new skills difficult. if not impossible. But dealing creatively with job transitions is preferable. for the people concerned and society as a whole. to denying ourselves increased trade opportunities."" I think it is appropriate that on this date in 1647 Margaret Brent proclaimed herself as Americas first feminist by demanding a voice and vote for herself in the Maryland Colonial Assembly. Brent came to America in 1638 and was the first woman to own property in Maryland. Mr. Speaker. the workers of the La Mujer Obreraare here today to demand a voice in the decisions that we make that affect their lives. As this body ponders serious policy questions. I encourage all of my colleagues to listen carefully to the voices of these people. the dislocated workers. and remember that what we are here to do is the peoples business. They expect and deserve this.\n'",few remark follow paragraph deliver lot people come floor recent week talk several member talk go district tonight want talk district reason open remark important story want tell colleague evening district represent experience naftarelated job loss other community country more job week delegation dislocated_worker district call tell theik story share member administration official evening listen remark communitybase_nonprofit organization dedicate work improve social economic condition lowincome hispanic worker family area many worker job garment industry most colleague know lot job go leave worker other job with*out skill need get new one pass provide training assistance worker dislocate_worker eligible training assistance get remedial english lesson important understand many people talk work pay taxis year agree ability speak help secure job worker become month work provide kind assistance make difference result pilot project launch hope address need dislocated_worker pilot project provide bilingual job training prepare dislocated_worker new job dislocated_worker benefit project member body listen story conclude bad other point fact new job create conclude good think truth lie bold initiative great experiment hit problem spot willing make correction way true affect people woman work garment industry year lose job use benefit job recent report member include say increase international trade lead job loss certain company certain sector response impede great trade develop effective program provide american worker training acquire new skill develop new business meet challenge underestimate worker find develop new skill difficult impossible deal job transition preferable people concern society whole deny increase trade opportunity think appropriate date proclaim feminist demand voice vote brent come first woman own property worker today demand voice decision make affect life body ponder serious policy question encourage colleague listen voice people dislocated_worker remember people business expect deserve,105.0,daily,0,1

I rise in opposition to the amendment of the gentleman from Illinois. I compliment the gentleman from Oklahoma for his leadership on this issue and associate myself with his remarks. The previous speakers are correct. We have heard all of the arguments on gun control on both sides of the issue of gun control from the same people year after year. Essentially I think those who favor Federal gun control generally consist of those who follow the Rousseauean philosophy that the behavior of man can be controlled by shaping his environment. that is. man will not commit crimes if he lives in an environment where guns are restricted or denied and we of the opposition who generally believe that the most effective way of solving the problem of criminal use of guns is to proceed against the criminal himself with swift apprehension. speedy trial. and sufficiently severe punishment that will deter the person and others from committing similar crimes with the illegal use of guns in the future. But the issues involved here. Mr. Chairman. go far beyond Federal gun control. The immediate issue is whether a Bureau can do by regulation what it has been refused the right to do by legislation. A recent study conducted by the Washington University of St. Louis. entitled ""The Costs of Government Regulation of Business"" noted that Federal rules and regulations will cost $102.7 billion in 1979. of which $4.8 billion represents the administrative costs for the Federal agencies involved and $97.9 billion marks the compliance costs for the private sector. Specific examples cited on the effect of regulations on consumer prices were staggering. For instance. the study estimated that regulations have driven up the price of a new car by $666 and the price of a new house by $1.500 to $2.500. There are currently over 4.400 different Federal forms that the private sector must fill out each year. requiring an estimated 143 million manhours to complete the same. We have reached the point where America is no longer run by the Congress or the President but by a nonelected bureaucracy. We already have too many statutes on the books permitting agencies to promulgate too many rules and regulations. Surely the House. in a short while. will blow the whistle against the Bureau of Alcohol.

I thank Senator FEINGOLD and .echo the words of the Democratic leader. the majority leader. HARRY REID. and his comments about this war and about the future of our country and what we need to do. I rise in support of the Feingold amendment. General Petraeus confirmed that our troops. operating under horrific conditions. are displaying the courage and the skill that define this whole engagement. Our troops have been courageous. Our troops have been skillful. Our troops have been effective. Our troops have been selfless. Our troops have done everything we have asked them to. But the civilians at the Pentagon and the politicians at the White House have bungled this war. The administration is selling one war and fighting another. They are selling a war where they are saying with a little more patience. we can truly say ""mission accomplished."" as if we didnt hear that last year and the year before and the year before that. The Presidents fighting of the war is one step forward. two steps back. and one that will require perhaps a decadelong engagement. More than anything. Americans deserve the truth. We are losing men and women. without a clear idea of whether or when we can bring our troops home. We are refraining from redeploying troops based on possibilitiespossibilities that are no worse than the realities we are facing now. Especially and mostly. we have lost our focus..We have lost our focus on Afghanistan. on rooting out alQaida. finding Osama bin Laden. and .protecting our borders. Instead. we spend $2.5 billion a week on a war2.5 billion a week on a war that even General Petraeus. by not answering Senator WARNERS question. acknowledges this war is making us no safer. So we spend $2.5 billion a week and the war is not making us safer and we are not doing what we should be in Afghanistan. what we should be doing in rooting out alQaida. what we should be doing in finding Osama bin Laden. and what we should be doing in protecting our borders. Instead. we are mired In a civil war. with no end in sight. As -long as the Iraqis. as Senator FEINGOLD said and so many of us who have wanted tohave a plan to redeploy our troops out of Iraq for 2 or 3 years nowas long as our commitment looks openended. as long as there is no end in sight to this civil war. there is no incentive for the Iraqis to do what they need to do. there is no incentive for a political settlement. where Sunnis and Shia and Kurds work together on a political settlement with a political compromise. and there is no incentive for the Iraqis because they think we are always going to be there in this openended commitment to the civil war. There is no incentive for them to do what they need to do to build a military security and police security force until the Iraqis know that. yes. there is an end date. We need to pass the Feingold amendment and the message will be that U.S. troops are going to redeploy out of Iraq. so it is now incumbent upon the Iraqis to do what they need to do through political compromise and through building their military and police security forces. and then Iraq can move forward. As long as we stay mired in a civil war and they think it is an openended commitment. we will continue to see this lack of progress. Military victories we can win. and have. and our soldiers and marines have waged and won those battles. But until we have a political victory. a compromise. a settlement. and the Iraqis build up their own security forces. the war goes on and on. It is time to bring our troops home in the safest and most orderly way we can. as Iraq accomplishes other urgent goals. such as border security. and we address the issues in Afghanistan and with alQaida.

I have never changed my position as to voting on prohibition since I first came to Congress in 1914. nor shall I do so today. At the election in 1914 the people of the State of Washington voted in their first referendum on prohibition. and in my campaign that year for election to the National House of Representatives I stated that. while I personally favored prohibition. if elected I would be the representative of the people in Congress. that. as such representative. I considered they were greater than I possibly could be. that when they went to the polls and legislated on any public question their will would be supreme. and that I would consider the vote of the majority at the polls to be a mandate which I would obey in Congress by voting on prohibition as they directed. They voted dry. I kept my pledge with them by voting dry here in Congress. In 1916 the people of the State of Washington voted again on prohibition on two referendum bills designed to weaken the prohibition laws of the State. They voted overwhelmingly dry. and in every campaign in which I have been a candidate since 1916 I have made the same pledge. namely. that. if reelected. I would vote in Congress on prohibition as the majority of the people of my State voted in a referendum. In my last campaign. in 1928. when the wet issue was prominent. I stated that I considered the referendum votes of the people as an instruction to me to vote ""dry."" and that I would continue to vote ""dry"" unless and until the people by referendum vote changed their instructions. During all these years I have kept that pledge by voting ""dry "" on every measure in behalf of prohibition that has come before Congress previous to this session. But in 1932 we had in the State of Washington another referendum on the repeal of the prohibition laws. In that election the people in the referendum voted overwhelmingly ""wet."" That is a mandate for me to vote to submit the eighteenth amendment for repeal and to vote for such liberalization of the Volstead Act as is permissible under the Constitution. I shall so vote whenever these measures come before the Senate. The people do not vote on the tariff. on taxes. on farm bills. or on the money question.

I understand that this amendment has been cleared with the chairman of the Armed Services Committee as well as the chairman of the Subcommittee on Manpower and Personnel. This amendment proposes to make changes in section 501(d) of the bill which addresses the problems associated with the imposition of statutory end strength ceilings at Department of Defense installations which are ""industrially funded."" For some time now. I have been concerned about the practice of the Department of Defense of requiring certain of their industrial/commercial type activities to have onboard no more than a certain number of people at a given day of the year which is usually the end of the fiscal year. These activitiespublic shipyards. weapons support centers. aircraft rework facilities. and other facilities which support the commercial/industrial base of the Department of Defensecannot always match their work cycles with that of the given year for which a specific manpower level is authorized. While I believe that such manpower ceilings may be only barriers to more efficient manpower management. a view supported by the General Acccounting Office in its reports on this issue. I also think the Senate Armed Services Committee has taken an important initiative in providing in law section 501(d) which requires thatIn activities engaged in maintenance. construction. and repair. the Secretary of Defense shall manage manpower resources in a manner that will insure that these activities are provided sufficient civilian manpower to fulill work requirements for which funds have been appropriated. In order to improve this section of the committee bill. I am proposing adding the activities engaged in ""engineering acquisition"" to those specified. An example of this kind of installation is the Naval Avionics Center in Indianapolis. Ind.. which provides electronics engineering services for the components of the naval air systems command. Angle rate bombing systems for the A4 and AV8 aircraft. as well as computer guidance systems for the Polaris and Poseidon submarinelaunched ballistic missiles are among the projects involving the services of the NAC. Inclusion of this language would also extend the concern of the committee to the other avionics facilities as well. My second proposal would simply add at the end of the section the phrase. ""on a schedule consistent with the requirements of national security and military readiness."" This would address the problem caused by substantial buildups in backlogs at such installations as the naval air rework facilities where testimony indicates that a decrease in manpower levels. because of the Leach amendment to the civil service reform bill has helped result in a 100percent backlog increase in the repair of airframes and engines. This certainly is not consistent with the requirements of national security or military readiness. It is my hope that the committees action will put an end to this recurring and chronic problem which finds industrially funded installations whose work has already been funded. forced to let fulltime and temporary workers go at the end of the fiscal year. only to be rehired if the Department of Defense in allocating ceiling points in the next fiscal year adds back workers thus setting in motion the same cycle. This is not good management. It does not help build morale for the Federal workers involved. It does not give us a better management grip on this problem which is necessary if we are to get the maximum value for our defense manpower dollar. To this extent. I would hope that the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee would follow suit with our colleagues in the House who want to take a comprehensive look on this whole problem of using manpower ceilings which may rob us of vital efficiencies we could otherwise obtain through their relaxation. In this connection. I understand that the chairman might be prepared to write a letter to Secretary of Defense asking for such an assessment in time for consideration of the fiscal year 1981 DOD authorization bill. It might be helpful if in his assessment. the Secretary of Defense could use some of the end strength flexibility of 11/ percent in excess of those employees authorized by law to operate one or more activities without ceiling controls. If this could be done and a report received. I think we would all be a much better position next year to judge the success of our efforts today. I hope the chairman could respond to these concerns. Finally. I want to thank the distinguished chairman of the Subcommittee on Manpower and Personnel for recognizing the gravity of this problem and helping to include section 501(d) in the bill. I am sure that by working together we can work out a solution to this problem which will benefit the country as a whole and strengthen our national defense. I am hopeful that the Senate will see fit to accept the amendments I have offered and want to thank the committee for its consideration.\n'",understand amendment clear chairman chairman amendment propose make change section bill address problem associate imposition statutory end strength ceiling installation fund time concern practice require certain industrial commercial type activity onboard more certain number people give day year end fiscal year activitiespublic shipyard weapon support center aircraft rework facility other facility support commercial industrial base match work cycle give year specific manpower level authorize believe such manpower ceiling barrier efficient manpower management view support report issue think take important initiative provide law section require thatin activity engage maintenance construction repair manage manpower resource manner insure activity provide sufficient civilian manpower fulill work requirement fund appropriate order improve section committee bill propose add activity engage engineering acquisition specify example kind installation provide electronics engineering service component naval command angle rate bombing system aircraft computer guidance system submarinelaunche_ballistic missile project involve service language extend concern committee other avionic facility second proposal add end section phrase schedule consistent requirement national security military readiness address problem cause substantial buildup backlog such installation naval facility testimony indicate decrease manpower level amendment civil service reform bill help result backlog increase repair airframe_engine consistent requirement national security military readiness hope committee action put end recur chronic problem find fund installation work fund force let fulltime temporary worker go end fiscal year rehire allocate ceiling point next fiscal year add worker set motion same cycle good management help build morale federal worker involve give well management grip problem necessary get maximum value defense manpower dollar extent hope chairman follow suit colleague want take comprehensive look whole problem use manpower ceiling rob vital efficiency obtain relaxation connection understand chairman prepare write letter ask assessment time consideration fiscal year authorization bill helpful assessment use end strength flexibility 11/ percent excess employee authorize law operate more activity ceiling control do report receive think well position next year judge success effort today hope chairman respond concern want thank distinguished chairman recognize gravity problem help include section bill sure work work solution problem benefit country whole strengthen national defense hopeful see_fit accept amendment offer want thank committee consideration.\n,96.0,bound,0,1

Congressman STANLEY LUNDINE4 which has the purpose of reinstating the Cost Accounting Standards Board function. The cost accounting standards (CAS) tunction was established in 1970 through an amendment to the Defense Production Act of 1950. It is section 719 of the DPA. and is a permanent part of that act. The CAS function provides authority to an independent board to issue standards governing the accounting principles which defense contractors are required to follow. The purpose of the CAS is to insure uniformity and consistency in the manner in which defense contractors account for their costs which become part of the prices they charge the Government. The Cost Accounting Standards Board and its activities have been inoperative since 1980 when the Congress determined to discontinue its funding. The 19 standards which have been promulgated. however. remain in effect with the full force of law. During the past 4 years. questions of interpretation of some of the CAS have arisen. as well as the possible need for changes in CAS because of changing circumstances. Furthermore. there are occasions when a waiver from the CAS is necessary. and there is no entity with authority to grant such waivers. The Subcommittee on Economic Stabilization conducted a hearing during March of this year or whether there is a need to reinstate the CAS function. We were prompted to call that hearing because. in the absence of any functioning entity. the Department of Defense has begun an initiative to fill the gap itself. Serious questions were raised during the course of the hearing about whether the DOD. the lead defense procuring agency. would be able to exercise sufficient independence in the performance of the CAS function. The primary feature of the DPAs Cost Accounting Standards Board is its independence from the procurement process. We are convinced there is a need to reinstate the cost accounting standards function. and that this should be accomplished as quickly as possible. The bill we are introducing today will begin that process. It would amend .certain portions of the existing statute which have become outdated because of changes which have occurred since the Board was first established 14 years ago. Shortly after we return from the Easter and Passover district work period. the Subcommittee on Economic Stabilization will begin hearings on this bill. as well as other proposals which have been put forward for reinstituting the CAS function. We believe this is an important issue. and one which should be resolved as soon as possible.*\n',today introduce bill join colleague purpose reinstate function cost accounting standard tunction establish amendment section permanent part act function provide authority independent board issue standard govern accounting principle defense contractor require follow purpose insure uniformity_consistency manner defense contractor account cost become part price charge activity inoperative determine discontinue funding standard promulgate remain effect full force law past year question interpretation arise possible need change change circumstance occasion waiver necessary entity authority grant such waiver conduct hearing year need reinstate function prompt call hearing absence function entity begin initiative fill_gap serious question raise course hearing lead defense procuring_agency able exercise sufficient independence performance function primary feature dpa independence procurement process convince need reinstate cost accounting standard function accomplish possible bill introduce today begin process amend portion exist statute become outdated change occur establish year return district work period begin hearing bill other proposal put reinstitute function believe important issue resolve possible.*\n,98.0,daily,0,1

I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time. I rise in support of H.R. 2. the Housing Opportunity and Responsibility Act. H.R. 2 provides comprehensive overhaul of the currently troubled public housing system. It eliminates the disincentives to work. increases accountability of public housing accountability authorities and balances the privileges and responsibilities of residents. In particular. I am supportive of the community work and selfsufficiency requirements that are central components to the bill. H.R. 2 requires that public housing residents spend 8 hours each month volunteering in their community. Their assistance is an invaluable resource in ensuring that public housing communities are safe. clean. and healthy places to live. Furthermore. residents must set a target date for obtaining selfsufficiency and moving out of public housing. Mr. Chairman. several weeks ago I visited the Olathe Salvation Army Family Lodge in my district. The lodge currently provides housing for 11 families who in exchange for their housing participate in a selfsufficiency program. The lodge has an 82 percent success rate in residents finding permanent private sector housing. This high success rate is attributed to the work requirements built into the program. I believe this type of success is a model for public housing authorities across America. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2 and the community work requirements.\n',thank gentleman yield time rise support provide comprehensive overhaul troubled public housing system eliminate disincentive work increase accountability public housing accountability authority balance privilege responsibility resident particular supportive community work selfsufficiency requirement central component bill require public housing resident spend hour month volunteer community assistance invaluable resource ensure public housing community safe clean healthy place live resident set target date obtain selfsufficiency move public housing several week visit district lodge provide housing family exchange housing participate selfsufficiency program lodge percent success rate resident find permanent private_sector housing high success rate attribute work requirement build program believe type success model public housing authority urge colleague support community work requirements.\n,105.0,daily,1,0

One major company. PhelpsDodge. is back in production and tentative settlements for most operations of the other three majors. Anaconda. American Smelting & Refining. and Kennecott are in the process of union ratification. It is inevitable that as new struggles develop in the labormanagement arena. much of the story of the copper strike will be forgotten. It is a matter of great concern to me. however. as it should be to all who are worried about the increasingly chaotic state of labormanagement relations in this country. that the lessons of this bitter dispute not be forgotten. The two lessons of the copper strike are. first. that increasingly union leaders are seeking inordinate amounts of economic power. second. that existing statutes designed to halt national emergency work stoppages and avoid the crisis bargaining situations are ineffective. The 8 y. -monthlong copper strike was accurately described by the New York Times as ""an economic holy war. a more fundamental test of strength between big labor and big business than any postwar industrial conflict."" rhe basic issue in the copper strike was not primarily the dollar and cents issue of wages and benefits. These settlements represent only a marginal improvement over the terms the workers could have obtained had they engaged in local bargaining to begin with. From the strikers point of view. the settlements certainly do not justify the tremendous economic losses suffered in 81/2 months of being out of a job. No. the purpose of the strike was not to obtain better economic conditions. The objective of the strike was. put simply. to impose industrywide bargaining on an industry which had traditionally bargained on the basis of local units. Leaders of the powerful United Steelworkers of America directed the strike. They sought the objective through two techniques. both of questionable legality. First. the 26 unions. representing copper workers. led by the Steelworkers Union. used the tactic of coalition bargaining. They formed a composite bargaining committee and insisted that the company deal with this group. To briefly reiterate what I have told the Senate in the past. coalition bargaining involves a combination of unions representing all the employees in a given company. They insist on negotiating jointly with the employer. and agree to refuse to settle for employees represented by one union until settlements have been reached covering all. This approach was designed by Walter Reuther and his Industrial Union Department of the AFLCIO as a means of strengthening the leverage of the labor movement. Coalition bargaining amounts to creation of a labor trust and needs to be dealt with in the same manner in which our laws forbid creation of industrial trusts. Coalition bargaining is designed to strengthen and extend the power of union leaders over management. In addition since it centralizes authority at the top. it destroys the autonomy of local unions and the desires and rights of individual union members become increasingly submerged. Moreover. this process is of highly questionable legality since it attempts to unilaterally alter bargaining units established by agreement between the employer. the employees and the union. and certified by the National Labor Relations Board. Once employees choose their representative. that representative only should have the right and duty to represent the employees. The second prong of the union thrust was the insistence on three preconditions for negotiations with the copper producersthat all contracts for all workers have substantially identical economic terms. that all contracts within a company expire on the same date. and that no settlements involving any operation within a company would be approved until settlements covering all operations had been achieved. The obvious aim of these preconditions was to achieve companywide settlements irrespective of the competitive positions of the numerous operations involved. including copper mining and smelting. copper refining. lead and zinc mining. and fabrication of wire. cable and brass. Of particular importance to the union coalition was common expiration dates on all contracts. That would give the unions the power to shut down all operations of a given company simultaneously. If common expiration dates were achieved. not only within a company but within all major companies. that power would be expanded to cover the entire industry. The insistence on these conditions by the union coalition also seems clearly to be illegal. By insisting on subjects outside the range of ordinary collective bargaining. the union coalition was refusing to bargain In good faith with the producers as is required by the TaftHartley Act. The illegality of the actions of the union coalition in this regard were subsequently recognized by the General Counsel of the NLRB. More about that later. Mr. President. I started into this issue back In August of 1967 after it became apparent that the copper strike. going on since July 15. would seriously endanger the economy of several Western States. as well as ruin many mining families and communities. I made speeches. introduced legislation. called the attention of the Senate and the administration repeatedly to the developing crisis in copper. It soon became apparent first. that negotiations were deadlocked over the unions companywide demands and that this work stoppage would have an immense impact on the national economy. Copper imports began to rise sharply to meet the needs of the country for the metal. including defense needs. The growth in imports increased an already serious adverse balance of payments. It is now clear that the strike was tragedy for the copperworkers. since only a very few can ever recover their losses. Under the circumstances. those of us in Congress representing the affected areas urged the administration to invoke the emergency strike provisions of the TaftHartley Act. We were joined in this plea by most major newspapers. including such liberal publications as the Washington Post and the New York Times. National concern over the economic effects of this strike has proven well justified. The U.S. News & World Report says that more than 50.000 copperworkers lost over $215 million in wages. the Federal tax losswas in excess of $100 million. and the balanceofpayments deficit Increased by $375 million. The average individual copperworker lost approximately $4.500 in wages. It will take 9 years or more for him to recoup that loss. The administration steadfastly refused through all this to seek a TaftHartley injunction. They claimed no national emergency existed. Instead. the administration sought to end. the strike * through an extralegal measure. the appointment of a factfinding board. This move created still moredelay and further hardship. The socalled Taylor Panel sought to compromise the differences between the producers and th& union doalition: Its recommendations went far toward meeting the demands of the union coalition. There was general astonishment. therefore. when the unions rejected this prolabor panels report. Again. it appeared that the only solution was the invocation of the emergency provisions of TaftHartley. But. again. the administration refused to take the obvious step. since the strike leaders opposed TaftHartley. Hence. the last act was the protracted negotiations in Washington under White House auspices which yielded the present settlements. From the beginning. the administration assisted the union leaders all that it could. In October 1967. the Kennecott Corp. charged that the attempt by strike leaders to force coalition bargaining constituted an unfair labor practice. Nothing happened for quite awhile. in sharp contrast to the action by the NLRB in 1966 when the Board moved swiftly to help the unions involved in an attempt to compel General Electric and the Union Carbide Co. to bargain companywide. Finally. in February 1968. after the unions had almost contemptuously rejected the recommendations of the Taylor Panel. the General Counsel of the NLRB issued a complaint in the Kennecott case charging the unions with failure to bargain in good faith. Immediately. the President intervened. He summoned the parties to Washington for forced White House bargaining sessions which finally resulted in present agreements. Several times these White House sponsored talks stalled. Cabinetlevel officers proposed settlements to the companies that broke the administrations now forgotten wage guidelines to smithereens. By its very intrusion into the copper situation. outside the law. the White House - gave one side. the union leaders. the industrywide bargaining framework they were seeking. and they must also share in the responsibility for managing the whole copper crisis in such a way that it will result in higher prices for copper products to every American consumer. and fewer jobs in the copper industry here at home. I have little doubt that the wage and fringe benefit settlements very close to those finally agreed upon could have been reached without a strike. or with a relatively short walkout. The union leaders in my opinion. wanted this strike for reasons which had nothing to do with the welfare of the copper workers or the copper industry: The leaders of the strike betrayed the copper workers. although I do not charge .they did so intentionally. Yet. there are ""6nly about 40.000 copper workers in the Steelworkers Union. which has a membership of 1.1 million. The majority of * union members are aluminum workers and.steel workers. and Ironically enough. both steel and aluminum are among coppers jrincipal competitors. The officials * of the Steelworkers Union have the satisfaction of knowing that even if the strike injured the entire copper industry. it helped the aluminum andsteel industries. The leaders oforgafiizedlabor suffered 1.a setback in their grab for more power. I hope that their ambition is thus satisfied for now. But I fear the leaders of organized labor view their setback as only temporary. Coalition bargaining will probably be tried again and again until Government shows a will to be fair to all parties. union. management. and workers. The Chairman of the Presidents Council of Economic Advisers. Arthur M. Okun. issued on March 28 a statement sharply criticizing the settlements in copper. He said the unions received higher wages than the public interest justified. Specifically. he said that PhelpsDodge. which raised copper prices 4 cents a pound in comparison with the prestrike prices. had gone ""far beyond the added costs of the wage increases."" Without criticizing Mr. Okun personally. for I realize his unenviable position. this administration statement demonstrates castiron nerve. On the one hand. the Johnson administration did everything it could to help the unions get an inflationary settlement. On the other. it solemnly deplores that settlement and the resulting prices increases in copper. . One thing is certain. The union bosses in this country are contemptuous of the pleas by administration leaders for restraint in wage settlements. We are soon to. be faced with aluminum and steel wage negotiations. both handled by the Steelworkers Union. and there is little question that the results of those negotiations will be another dose of inflation. The lesson in Britain. where wages outran productivity. seems to have been lost on these power mad union aristocrats. Our fiscal situation is bad and will get worse as wage settlements continue to outrun productivity. Yet. our labor barons cling to an outmoded concept .of class warfare. Eventually they will bring upon us inflation which will trigger a great depression. or an aroused public will turn upon them and strip away this excess of power. A government impotent In the face of any segment of our population is a pitiful sight. Perhaps.i the administration will learn something from the disastrous copper strike. Perhaps. there will be another look at the provisions of our basic labor legislation and a steadfast and concerted attempt to remedy the serious imbalance. In this connection. I would like to call "" the attention of the Senate to the hearings now being conducted by Senator ERVIN. of North Carolina. chairman of the Subcbmmittee on Separation of Powers. The bias of the National Labor Relations Board and the extremes flouting the intent of Congress is a governmental disgrace. I ask unanimous consent that my testimony before that subcommittee setting forth particulars of this continuing problem be printed at the conclusion of my remarks.\n'",nationwide strike copper

I miust rise In opposition to the amendment offered by the Senator from Ohio. My friend from Illinois. Senator DxoN. the chairman of the subcommittee. has worked long and hard. as I have. to develop a compromise on the Issue. There have been a number of proposals put forth. We have not yet come up with a satisfactory proposal. and we have had some very good suggestions delivered to us by GAO. which I will cite in a moment. I oppose very strongly adding this extraneous amendment to the housing bill that we put so much time and effort into. I also havte some substantive objections to the amendment. For all of the problems cited by the sponsor. the Senator from Ohio. there are much better remedies available. remedies that will be substantially delayed If his amendment Is developed. This piece of legislation. I fear. is heavyhanded overkill. There are several basic reasons we should not enact the Metzenbaum government checkcashing and lifeline banking proposals. First of all. there Is no clear and convincing evidence that lowcost financial services are unavailable. According to the GAO. as of mid1985. 86 percent of banks cashed U.S. Treasury checks for nondepositors. In my home State of Missouri. a recent survey of members of the Missouri Bankers Association revealed that 87 percent of the institutions offered lowcost checking accounts. 90 percent of the banks cashed Government checks for .nondepositors. The Metzenbaum proposal set up a rigid scheme that detailed exactly how banks must offer these services. Given the fact that basic checkcashing and banking services are already widely available. what is gained by forcing all banks. credit unions. and savings and loans. to conform with the rigid Federal prescription In these bills? These financial institutions will incur additional costs. The possibility for innovation or local flexibility will be eliminated or at least significantly reduced by the detailed strictures in the proposal now before us. Although I do not believe there is a problem with lack of access to financial services in my State. I am willing to accept the premise there may be areas in the country where people do have difficulty getting their Government benefit checks cashed. There may well be a problem in large urban areas. for example. Even so. this proposed amendment does not offer the best solution to the problem. Direct deposit of Government checks. electronic delivery of benefits. or even having the Post Office cash checks are much more promising solutions than this amendment. The sponsor pointed out that a GAO study was requested. and that GAO study was delivered in October 1988. In that study. on page 33 it points out that State and local governments have attempted to resolve checkcashing difficulties. They have included negotiating with commercial banks to cash nondepositor checks. mandating banks to provide lowcost accounts. delivering checks to checkcashing centers. regulating -check cashing and checkcashIng centers. and other solutions. We also know from testimony before the committee that States that have required such check cashing provide funds for indemnification of those institutions which do provide check cashing. In summary. at the bottom of page 40 of the GAO report. it says: Requiring banking institutions to cash nondepositor checks is not the only way to improve Individual access to Government benefits. Use of electronic funds transfer technology. for example. has been cited as a way to solve checkcashing problems by bringing more Government check recipients into the banking system. Its use could also lower Government costs and reduce banking institution concerns about check forgeries ani long lines in their lobbies. Current technology can also make benefits available through use of plastic cards at automatic teller machines and pointofsale outlets. This approach could reduce the concerns of those who do not want to have banking accounts. Recipients could also obtain additional benefits. such as the option not to take the full amount in cash at one time. The Office of Technology Assessment has reported that it is inevitable that federally funded assistance programs will ultimately move to some form of electronic delivery system. The conclusion of the GAO report says: Matters for Congress to consider: We recognize that there are costs associated with the cashing of Government checks. If Congress determines that the recipients of certain Government checks should not bear these costs or should be assured of a lowcost option. It ihould consider encouraging methods that utilize plastic cards and electronic funds transfer technology. Mr. President. those are recommendations not from lobbyists. lobbyists for financial institutions. lobbyists for consumer groups. or lobbyists for others interested In It. these are the conclusions of the GAO. I also note that both New York City and the State of Pennsylvania deliver welfare benefits electronically. and they have had very positive experiences with it. For example. New York City has been delivering public assistant and food stamps electronically since 1984. The new system has eliminated 200.000 annual incidents of lost or stolen benefits. Every year. the city saves $9 million in administrative costs. The State of Pennsylvania estimates that their direct delivery system for public assistance saves the State $25 million a year in addition to eliminating the need for replacement checks for those stolen from the mail and allowing recipients quicker and easier access to their money. The Treasury Department estimates that it costs approximately 27 cents to issue a paper check. while electronic payments cost approximately 3 cents each. The Treasury Department testified before our Banking Committee last June that a recipient is 1.500 percent more likely to have a benefit check stolen if it is mailed than if it Is direct deposited. Under the amendment we are considering today. if that Is adopted. we are going to be mandating an inefficient and dangerous system of continued reliance on paper checks when there is much better technology available at lower cost and at greater safety to the senior citizens. to the lowincome people. to the ones whose welfare we ought to be concerned about. Treasury is currently doing an experiment with SSI recipients in Baltimore who will receive a plastic access card which will allow them to get their benefits from either ATMs or pointofsale terminals in retail Alores. When Treasury was e.i d to testify on the proposal before us today. it concluded its testimony by saying: We believe that the future for electronic benefits is far brighter than to continue to emphasize check delivery. Mr. President. I agree completely with this conclusion. Treasury should continue its efforts to promote the electronic delivery of benefits. It is cheaper for the Government and safer for recipients. who do not have to worry about having paper checks stolen from the mail and who do not have to worry about being robbed while carrying large sums of cash home from the bank or the checkcashing store. Enacting this measure will freeze in place the system of paper checks when it is not in the best intere.it of consumers or of the Government. not to mention the financial institutions involved. While I believe that direct deposit - and electronic delivery is the ultimate solution to the problem addressed by the sponsor of this bill. I think there are interim solutions that are preferable to this bill. We have heard directly from Postmaster General Tony Frank that the Postal Service is willing to consider a proposal to cash Government checks in the 39.000 post offices across the country. The Postal Service already sells money orders. so it would not be a great leap for them to get in the business of cashing Government checks. There are certain standards and qualifications set out in the letter from the Postal Service under Postmaster General Franks signature. It should be considered. But the paper yesterday reportedly quoted the Postmaster General as saying: We are owned by the American people. If we can serve. by cashing Government checks. people who would not otherwise be served. we should take a look at it. The article in the American Banker continues. However. if Congress requires banks to cash Government checks. there would be little need for his agency to offer this service. Finally. there is another argument against the amendment presented to us today. There are far more post offices than theise are banks. Informally. the Post Office has suggested to my office that they would not charge much more for cashing a Government check than they do for money orders. 75 cents or a dollar.

Now. at some point I am going to offer a very simple amendment that will either be stricken by a point of order or it will have to be defeated. But the amendment that I plan to offer in conjunction with the efforts here of the gentleman from Florida will say that none of the funds in this act may be used to pay for NATO expansion not authorized by law. Unless there would be some existing law that would authorize the use of the funds. there could not be an appropriation account that could be created to provide NATO expansion funds. Mr. Chairman. that could be a little controversial and I do not want to do that. But my people have paid taxes all these years and we keep having all of these accounts. billions and billions of dollars.

Walters accomplishments in the cable television area. as extensive as they were. are not the main reason I wish to honor him today.

Walter was born to a life of poverty. After years of struggle he was awarded a scholarship to Harvard University. became a soldier. fought for our country in World War II. completed law school. was married and became a father. His was the classic ""rags to riches"" phenomenon. However. the most admirable thing about Walter was his ability to always maintain his perspective and his compassion for those who were not as fortunate as he. Being a lawyer myself. I am happy to say that he was a magnificent lawyer. We used to joke about opening a law firm together when both of us would have retired. Walter was a devoted family man. involving his family in his personal as well as his business pursuits. He leaves four children. Spencer. Carolyn.

I intend to vote for this legislation because. frankly. I could care less how long a man is incarcerated who desecrates the flag of the United States of America. But I rise to ask a few questions of the Members of the House and to state the dangers in passing this piece of legislation. I rise not for the reasons of the gentleman from Michigan or the gentleman from New York or the gentleman from California. Our philosophies are poles apart. I do not question the sincerity of the 11 law professors whom the gentleman from California cited. But the argument that a Vietcong sympathizer has the right to burn the flag and desecrate the flag of this country. the symbol of the United States of America. is in my opinion not the argument of a civil libertarianit is the argument of a civil libertine. It is a philosophy that is saturated all too deeply with the seeds of anarchy. It is a philosophy that spells ill for the future of this country. I. too. agree. Mr. Chairman. that you cannot legislate patriotism and I think that this body would be making a mistake if it feels that by passing this legislation it would be getting to the roots of the real problem. For 178 years there has not been on the statutory books of the United States of America a criminal statute providing a penalty for the desecration of the flag of the United States of America. I think we should ask the question. Why have we not had such a law? The answer is very simple: It has not been necessary to have such a law throughout the entire history of the United States of America. What would have happened 10 or 20 years ago if a citizen of the United States of America had the audacity to burn the flag of the United States of America? I believe we all know what would have happened. He would not have been able to leave the scene of the burning. Mr. Chairman. I have had the opportunity since I have been in Congress to .deal with the type of people who are desecrating the flag because of my committee assignments and I feel that we have overlooked a very important point. Show me a child. for example. who has not been subjected to discipline and I will show you a child. 99 times out of 100. who will have no love or respect for his parents. The same is true of certain citizens who have not been subjected to the discipline of fair and firm enforcement of the laws. Love and respect for country are concomitants of fair and firm discipline. Perhaps the real answer to the problem with which we are now concerned lies in more diligent. fair. and firm enforcement of the laws now on the books. Mr. Chairman. our citizenry and lawenforcement officials should harken to the words of Abraham Lincoln. a great lover of liberty and respect for law and order. Let every American. every lover of liberty. every wellwisher to his prosperity. swear by the blood of the Revolution. never to violate in the least particular. the laws of the country * * * Let every man remember that to violate the law is to trample on the blood of his father and to tear the character of his own and his childrens liberty. Let reverence for the laws be breathed by every American mother. to the lisping babe that prattles on her laplet it be taught in schools. in seminaries and in colleges. let it be written in primers. spelling books. and in almanacs. let It be preached from the pulpit. proclaimed in legislative halls. and enforced in courts of justice. And. in short. let it become the political religion of the Nation. and let the old and young. rich and poor. the grave and gay. of all sexes. tongues and colors and conditions. sacrifice unceasingly upon its altars. * * * While ever a state of feeling. such as this. shall universally. or even. very generally prevail throughout the nation. vain will be every effort. and fruitless every attempt. to subvert our national freedom. I hope.

In recognition of the tradition of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure to annually move bills to reauthorize the Coast Guard and the indispensable services it provides to the Nation. I am inclined to support this effort if it will improve the condition and readiness of the Coast Guard. My home State of West Virginia may not be a coastal State. but our many stakeholders who use our inland waterways. such as shippers. tug and barge operators. and recreational boaters. appreciate the services provided by the Coast Guard. our guardians of the sea. For example. the Coast Guards National Maritime Center in Martinsburg. West Virginia. handles the processing and approval of all mariner credentials for roughly a quarter million mariners. Additionally. the Coast Guards Marine Safety Unit Huntington. located in Barboursville. West Virginia. inspects vessels. conducts casualty investigations. and ensures port security along the Ohio River and other navigable waterways. These and other vital services provided by the Coast Guard directly support our maritime commerce. which is critical to the future economic health of our country. Yet despite widespread acknowledgment of its importance. the Coast Guard has rarely received sufficient resources to accomplish its many complex missions. I am disappointed that the authorized funding levels in this legislation again fall short of the services needs. Just this week. we learned during the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Subcommittees hearing concerning the Deepwater Horizon disaster that the Coast Guards marine environmental response capabilities have dwindled due to a lack of funding. We cannot expect the men and women of the Coast Guard to put their lives at risk to save the lives of others if they are forced to operate from inadequate facilities and to utilize equipment that has long since passed its expected lifetime. If we expect our ports and waterways to remain safe and secure and if we want our maritime economy to be vibrant and growing. adequate investment in the Coast Guard is not an option but a requirement. I also wish to express my concern about the ballast water provisions. a separate titlein fact. a wholly separate billstitched into this legislation. but not seamlessly and not without consequence. Numerous State and local economies have had to deal with the immense costs associated with the invasion of plants and animals that hitch a ride into our country through dumped ballast water. Coastal States are spending millions each year to control invading species. and each year. more and more invaders threaten to become established in our waters. For these reasons. I support the provisions that call for the adoption of stringent national standards for ballast water treatment technologies. These advances would help to prevent the introduction and spread of these invaders and ensure the efficient flow of critical commodities through waterborne transportation. But. unfortunately. tucked within the appealing treatment technology provisions of this added title lies a poison pill that this House would be foolish to swallow. All this year. this Congress has been advocating an enhanced role for the States in protecting their economies and environment. The mantra has been: Back off the States. Remove the heavy hand of the Federal Government and allow the States the space to oversee their own programs. But now. tucked into the folds of this bill is a complete aboutface. Rather than respecting State powers and allowing them the freedom to. in limited circumstances. set higher standards to protect their own waters and their own residents. this bill imposes a downfromonhigh. onesizefitsall approach. I find it ironic that. on an issue on which the States have taken a leading role in the absence of Federal action. this legislation would prohibit States from having any role in protecting their local resources. So I say to my colleagues that we have a choice to support the benefits provided by this bill without also swallowing the bitter antiStates rights pill. An amendment offered by my colleague from New York would protect the States. The Bishop amendment represents a surgical fix that enables the States to nominate ""no discharge zones"" to protect important State waters. Contrary to some claims. the amendment would not allow a State to shut down vital shipping zones or exempt all its waters from ballast discharges. The amendment specifically addresses these concerns. preventing a State from taking such action. It provides for limited exemptions just like those available to the States in section 312 of the Clean Water Act for sanitary dischargesan exemption. I would point out. that has been used only 26 times. The Bishop amendment would restore the historic balance between the States and the Federal Government intended by the Clean Water Act. If the Members of this body believe that States rights must be protected from Federal overreach. this bill begs the question: Are you with the States or against the States? I support the amendment offered by the gentleman from New York . and I urge its adoption as a critical fix to an otherwise worthy bill. I urge my colleagues to join me in voting to make that critical fix and to pass this legislation.\n'",thank subcommittee rank member gentleman yield time recognition tradition move bill reauthorize indispensable service provide nation inclined support effort improve condition readiness home coastal state many stakeholder use inland_waterway such shipper tug_barge operator recreational_boater appreciate service provide guardian sea example handle processing approval mariner credential quarter mariner locate inspect vessel conduct casualty investigation ensure port security other navigable_waterway other vital service provide support maritime commerce critical future economic health country widespread acknowledgment importance receive sufficient resource accomplish many complex mission disappoint authorize funding level legislation fall short service need week learn hearing concern disaster marine environmental response capability dwindle lack funding expect man woman put life risk save life other force operate inadequate facility utilize equipment pass expect lifetime expect port waterway remain safe secure want maritime economy vibrant grow adequate investment option requirement wish express concern ballast_water provision separate titlein fact separate billstitche legislation consequence numerous local economy deal immense cost associate invasion plant animal hitch_ride country dump ballast_water spend million year control invading specie year more more invader threaten become establish water reason support provision call adoption stringent national standard ballast_water treatment technology advance help prevent introduction spread invader ensure efficient flow critical commodity waterborne transportation tuck appealing treatment technology provision add title lie poison_pill foolish swallow year advocate enhanced role protect economy environment mantra remove heavy hand allow space oversee own program tuck fold bill complete aboutface respect power allow freedom limited circumstance set high standard protect own water own resident bill impose downfromonhigh approach find ironic issue take lead role absence federal action legislation prohibit have role protect local resource say colleague choice support benefit provide bill swallow_bitter antistate right pill amendment offer colleague protect amendment represent surgical fix enable nominate discharge zone protect important water contrary claim amendment allow state shut vital shipping zone exempt water ballast discharge amendment address concern prevent state take such action provide limited exemption available section sanitary exemption point use time amendment restore historic balance intend member body believe right protect overreach bill beg question support amendment offer gentleman urge_adoption critical fix worthy bill urge colleague join vote make critical fix pass legislation.\n,112.0,daily,0,1
1040128630,S,19950927,13,Mr. ROCKEFELLER,Unknown,ROCKEFELLER,Unknown,M,674,927,09271995.txt,8404,541,104117461,ROCKEFELLER,JOHN,S,WV,M,D,,voting,Madam President. speaking as a proponent of the amendment. this amendment would strike a provision in the bill which cuts off disability compensation to certain veterans who are disabled by reason of mental problems. It cuts off their savings when they reach $25.000. We do that for no other veteran. We do that for nobody else in the country. as far as I know. The amendment is funded by limiting any tax cut under the budget resolution to families earning less than $100.000. Madam President. there is no justification whatever for singling out mentally disabled people for discriminatory treatment. There is none. If these veterans are disabled. we as a nation have said that they are entitled to disability compensationentitled to it. It is in the law. We have not said they are entitled to compensation only if they are poor. We have not said they are entitled to compensation only if they have savings less than $25.000. We have not said they are entitled to compensation only if they have no sources of funds from anywhere else. They are entitled to compensation. We have said that they are entitled because of their disability. Are we prepared to say now. for some reason. that mentally disabled people are somehow less entitled as veterans. solely because they are disabled? This Senator is not. hence. my amendment. I urge my colleagues to waive the Budget Act and then to strike this provision which discriminates against mentally disabled veterans. Mr. President. during last evenings debate on my amendment to strike the provision from the appropriations bill which provides for a cutoff of compensation to mentally disabled veterans when their savings reach a certain level. we were operating then under a limited time agreement. which I accepted in the interests of moving the progress of the bill. However. there were a number of points made during that debate which should not go unanswered. so I am making this further statement to describe more fully my views on this legislation. Mr. President. one point that was made a number of times during the debate was that the mentally incompetent veterans we are talking about have all of their needs taken care of by VA. I am not certain what point was being made. but I think it is vital to note that the individuals that are covered by this amendment are not under VA care. However their needs are being addressed. it is not a result of VA activity except to the extent that the veterans use their compensation payments to pay for care. Another point that must be addressed relates to the relationship of those who might receive some of the veterans estate at the time of the veterans death. As I noted in my statement last evening. it is certainly possible that some remote heirs might benefit from a mentally incapacitated veterans estate. However. the only thing this provision ensures is that the veterans estate will be diminished unless the veteran has dependents. There is nothing in the provision which limits its effect to noncaring. distant relatives. The existence of a loving. caring nondependent child who sees the veteran daily would not be sufficient to keep this provision from taking effect. It would be triggered in any case in which there are no dependents. Mr. President. the suggestion was made that this provision is necessary in order to keep remote heirs from inheriting the estates of mentally disabled veterans. I note that no evidence was cited to support the proposition. nor is there any evidence that I am aware of. that would demonstrate that a mentally impaired veteran is any more likely to leave an estate to remote heirs than a mentally competent one. It is important to highlight that the VA process relating to a declaration of incompetency does not mean that a veteran does not have the ability to execute a valid will. This concern about socalled remote heirs would apply to any disabled veteran who dies without a will. Any veteranmentally disabled or otherwisewho is able to execute a will and who does so should not have limitations on who can be named as beneficiary under the will. nor any restriction on the amount of the estate that can pass under the will. If there is a governmental interest in restricting inheritance of estates. any part of which is made up of VA compensationand let me be clear. I do not believe that there is--then it must apply equally to a disabled veteran who is not mentally incompetent. As many of my colleagues know. the original enactment of this provision was challenged by the Disabled American Veterans in a lawsuit in 1991. The Federal court that heard the caseand which declared that original enactment unconstitutionalnoted that the limitation did not affect the payment of compensation to between 95 to 98 percent of the disabled veterans who have no dependents. It hardly makes sense or can be defended that this small group of mentally disabled veterans should be singled out for this treatment. Mr. President. the only characteristic that distinguishes the class of veterans that is being singled out in this legislation is their mental injury or disease. Perhaps some believe that these veterans are less likely to object to such governmental intrusion into their lives. but that is hardly a basis for this sort of legislation which takes away compensation to which the veterans are entitled. Mr. President. it is worth noting that about 85 percent of estates left by mentally incompetent veterans are inherited by close family members. While these individuals may or may not be dependents. that should hardly disqualify them from inheriting the veterans estates. Indeed. it is very often these individualsparents. nondependent children. brothers and sisters. other close family members--who have made significant personal sacrifices to care for the veteran during the veterans lifetime. Mr. President. it should be noted that the estates of mentally disabled veterans are frequently made up of funds from sources other than VA benefits. and the effect of this provision would be to require these veterans to reduce the overall value of their estates in order to continue to receive the compensation which is their due. The bottom line. Mr. President. is this: No matter what arguments are put forward in an attempt to justify this provision. in the end it can only be seen as what it is--rank discrimination against mentally disabled veterans. It is unworthy of the Congress and should be rejected. Mr. President. I am aware of the two reports--a 1982 GAO report and a 1988 VA inspector general report--that are cited as the justification for this provision. While it may be argued that some support for this provision may be found in one or both of these reports. I think that a closer examination will show that this reliance is misplaced. For example. Mr. President. neither report provided evidence that mentally disabled veterans accumulate more assets than other veterans. Nor did either report find a basis for distinguishing mentally disabled veterans from all other disabled veterans on the issue of the disposition of their estates or as to any other element related to their VA compensation. In fact. neither report looks at competent veterans. Both reports assumed. with no basis. that mentally disabled veterans do not have wills. This is simply not true. Neither report studied mentally competent veterans to learn how they dispose of their estates. The GAO report looked at a small sampleonly four regional officeshardly a sufficient basis on which to make so sweeping a change in VA compensation policy. With respect to the inspector generals report. my colleagues may not know that the IG did not recommend that compensation payments to mentally incompetent veterans be stopped. butrather recommended that the compensation payments be paid into a special trust fund on behalf of the veterans. Mr. President. in essence. this provision is establishing a means test for one very small group of veterans. and doing so on a very scant record. I know that both the House and Senate Veterans Affairs Committees supported this provision in OBRA 90. We made a mistake then. and nowhere is that demonstrated more clearly than in the district court opinion in the suit brought by DAV. Our committee could have repeated the mistake in this Congress as we worked to meet our reconciliation mandate. We did not. The Senate should not do so either.\n',speak proponent amendment amendment strike provision bill cut disability compensation certain veteran disable reason mental problem cut saving reach other veteran country know amendment fund limit tax cut budget resolution family earn less justification single disabled people discriminatory treatment none veteran disabled nation say entitle disability compensationentitle law say entitle compensation poor say entitle compensation saving less say entitle compensation source fund entitle compensation say entitle disability prepared say reason disabled people entitled veteran disabled amendment urge colleague waive strike provision discriminate disabled_veteran last evening debate amendment strike provision appropriation bill provide cutoff compensation disabled_veteran saving reach certain level operate limited time agreement accept interest move progress bill number point make debate go unanswered make further statement describe view legislation point make number time debate incompetent veteran talk need take care certain point make think vital note individual cover amendment care need address result activity extent veteran use compensation payment pay care point address relate relationship receive veteran estate time veteran death note statement last evening possible remote heir benefit incapacitated veteran estate only thing provision ensure estate diminish veteran dependent provision limit effect noncaring distant relative existence loving care nondependent child see veteran sufficient keep provision take effect trigger case dependent suggestion make provision necessary order keep remote heir_inherit estate disabled_veteran note evidence cite support proposition evidence aware demonstrate impair veteran likely leave estate remote heir competent important highlight process relate declaration incompetency mean veteran ability execute valid will concern socalled remote heir apply disabled_veteran die will disabled otherwisewho able execute will limitation name beneficiary will restriction amount estate pass will governmental interest restrict inheritance estate part make compensationand let clear believe apply disabled_veteran incompetent many colleague know original enactment provision challenge disabled american lawsuit federal court hear caseand declare original enactment unconstitutionalnote limitation affect payment compensation percent disabled_veteran dependent make sense defend small group disabled_veteran single treatment only characteristic distinguish class veteran single legislation mental injury disease believe veteran likely object such governmental intrusion life basis sort legislation take compensation veteran entitle worth note percent estate leave incompetent veteran inherit close family member individual dependent disqualify inherit veteran estate individualsparent nondependent child brother_sister other close family member make significant personal sacrifice care veteran veteran lifetime note estate disabled_veteran make fund source other benefit effect provision require veteran reduce overall value estate order continue receive compensation due bottom_line argument put attempt justify provision end see rank discrimination disabled_veteran unworthy reject aware report report inspector_general report cite justification provision argue support provision find report think close examination show reliance misplace example report provide evidence disabled_veteran accumulate more asset other veteran report find basis distinguish disabled_veteran other disabled_veteran issue disposition estate other element relate compensation fact report look competent veteran report assume basis disabled_veteran will true report study competent veteran learn dispose estate report look small regional sufficient basis make sweeping change compensation policy respect inspector_general report colleague know recommend compensation payment incompetent veteran stop recommend compensation payment pay special trust fund behalf veteran essence provision establish means test small group veteran do scant record know support provision make mistake demonstrate district court opinion suit bring committee repeat mistake work meet reconciliation mandate either.\n,104.0,daily,0,1

Why? Because every man who has got 412 grains of silver will refuse to take one cent less than a dollar for it. knowing that he can take it to the mint and have it coined into a dollar. That fixes a price below which it can not fall. but when silver is not monetized. when it is a commodity. as this bill makes it. the case is difierent. You pile it up in the Treasury as a commodity. and when you take it out by a note you can not go and have that silver coined. it is a mere commodity. On the other hand. when you take out a piece of gold bullion with a note. you can take it directly to the mint and have it coined. There is a vast difference between a metal that is monetized and one that is demonetized. Silver is now monetized. It is now a commodity. and when you issue notes upon it you issue notes upon it as a commodity. Unless you have some compulsory coinage of that bullion you can not maintain the proposition that it is any better as a basis for coinage than wheat. except that it is not perishable. or any better than lead or zinc. which are not perishable. You can not coin lead or iron or zinc. nor can you coin the silver that is piled up in the Treasury Department unless you authorize it by law. Hence. I claim that it is a matter of great importance to the friends of silver. to those who are in favor of the true theory of money in this country. to insist that silver shall have the right of coinage to some extent. however limited it may be. so as to coatradistinguish it from commodities. That is what I mean. When you say that silver bullion shall not be coined. that practically no coin shall be issued upon it. but it shall be placed in the Treasury and notes issued upon it. you treat it as a commodity. it is no more entitled to coinage than iron or zinc or any other metal.\n',say moment provide free_coinage silver commodity monetize man get grain silver refuse take cent less dollar know take mint_coin dollar fix price fall silver monetize commodity bill make case difierent pile commodity take note go silver_coin mere commodity other hand take piece gold_bullion note take mint_coin vast difference metal monetize one demonetize_silver monetize commodity issue note issue note commodity compulsory coinage bullion maintain proposition well basis coinage wheat perishable lead_zinc perishable coin lead iron zinc coin silver pile authorize law claim matter great importance friend silver favor true theory money country insist silver right coinage extent limited coatradistinguish commodity mean say silver_bullion coin coin issue place note issue treat commodity entitled coinage iron zinc other metal.\n,51.0,bound,0,1

The bill provides a needed equalization in the benefits provided to veterans who served in the Armed Forces during the Vietnam era with benefits previously provided to veterans of World War I. World War II. and the Korean conflict. S. 16 was passed by the Senate on February 7. 1967. and is now awaiting action In the House. However. I believe that S. 16 is unnecessarily restrictive. inadequate. and unfair in that it defines the ""Vietnam era"" as having begun August 5. 1964. the day of the Gulf of Tonkin incident. Considerable doubt has been thrown on the facts surrounding the socalled Gulf of Tonkin incident. However. whatever the actual facts may be concerning that incident. it is true that U.S. involvement in hostilities in Vietnam began much earlier than August 5. 1964. Socalled advisers from the Armed Forces of the United States had been in South Vietnam since 1954. For the U.S. military adviser riding a helicopter over South Vietnam and facing Vietcong machinegun firewith possibly getting killed or woundedthe fighting was just as serious and just as dangerous whether the engagement took place on August 4 or August 5. 1964. or on August 5. 1961. The family of the U.S. soldier killed by hostile action in Vietnam on August 4 can be just as needy as the family of a soldier killed the next day. The artificial distinction which the administration seeks to create between events before and after the Gulf of Tonkin incident bears no relationship whatsoever to the realities of the situation. The facts cannot be changed. History cannot be rewritten. Between January 1. 1961. and January 1. 1964. 194 armed service personnel were killed in Vietnam. 146 of these were killed as a result of hostile action. During this period 1.100 servicemen were wounded in Vietnam. 15.000 servicemen have served in Vietnam. These men who were injured or killed in Vietnam before August 5. 1964. were not there of their own volition. They were ordered there by their own Government. However misguided may have been the policies of their Government in sending them to Vietnam In such an equivocal role. they and their families should not be forced to bear the burdens of their Governments follies. The bill I am. introducing today is identical to S. 16 in providing veterans with disability compensation at wartime rates. pensions for nonserviceconnected disabilities and deaths. allowances for burial expenses. benefits for drugs and therapeutic devices. and automobile allowance for seriously disabled veterans. The only change contained in the bill I offer from S. 16 is that these benefits are extended to all military personnel who served in Vietnam from February 1. 1955. through August 4. 1964. The benefits provided by S. 16 to all members of the Armed Forces. who served at any time subsequent to August 4. 1964. regardless of where they served. are the same as they were in S. 16.

By way of contrast. the cap that we propose would be paid for 89 percent by that 5 percent of the taxpayers who earn $50.000 and more. It would be paid for by those who are the principal beneficiaries of Mr. Reagans 1981 tax cut. which has plunged us into this enormous deficit. Mr. Reagan came to office in 1980 blaming all of our difficulties upon the deficit. Now that he has become the Babe Ruth of deficit financing. he wants to forget about the deficit and threatens to veto a bill that would reduce that deficit by $6 billion this year and by some $8 billion next year. He wants to veto a bill that would reduce the deficit by requiring those who are the most wealthy. the most privileged. the most affluent in our society. to accept only a $700 tax cut this year instead of a $4.000 tax cut that otherwise might inure to a $100.000 taxpayer.

I went to Augustana College. which is in the Quad Cities. and then went to Illinois State University in Normal. IL. and then down to the University of Illinois. At each one of those campuses I had a press conference about student debt. Student debt today has reached a point where we have to pay close attention to itand we should. The vast majority of Americans ask a very basic question: Senator. is there anything you are doing today that really is going to help my family? For 44 million Americans currently paying on student loans in America. legislation that is going to be introduced tomorrow can make a big difference. I am cosponsoring a bill with ELIZABETH WARREN. the Senator from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. a very bright lady who was on the faculty of the Harvard Law School and who understands these issues better than almost anyone I have ever met. She is leading the way on a college student loan refinancing bill. Here is what we are trying to do. We are trying to get those students who are trapped in big debts with high interest rates a chance to refinance their loans. How significant could it be? Well. when I met these students at different schools. they told me their stories. As a former college borrower myself. as a father raising three kids who went through college. it was sad. It was really sad to hear their stories because the amount of debt that students are running into now is dramatically higher than anything those of us who were in the early stages of college loans ever experienced. I will not even tell you how much I borrowed because it makes me sound ancient. But it scared me to death when I borrowed that money to go through college and law school for fear I would never pay it back. It turns out I did as I was supposed to. But students today many times find themselves so deeply in debt they just cannot get out from under it. Now. I am going to set over here on this side a whole category of speeches on institutions known as forprofit colleges and universities. They are in a special place in my thinking. Forprofit colleges and universities. who are they? The biggest one is the University of Phoenix. Apollo Group owns a series of universities. You have seen their advertising. I will bet. They. at one point. had over 450.000 students in this University of Phoenix network of schools across the country. The second biggest is DeVry. another forprofit university out of my State of Illinois. Kaplan is the third largest. I am going to set them over here because they are in a special category. They are in a category of colleges and universities that we ought to be doing something about. Three numbers tell the story about the forprofit colleges and universities. Ten percent of high school graduates go to forprofit colleges and universities. Ten percent of Americas high school graduates go to these schools. These schools receive 20 percent of all Federal aid to education10 percent of the students. 20 percent of the Federal aid. These forprofit colleges and universities receive over $32 billion a year in Federal aid. Why is it so much if they only have 10 percent of the students? Because they charge so much when it comes to tuition. But here is the number: 46. Fortysix percent of all student loan defaults are students out of forprofit colleges and universities. Why? Worthless diplomas. too much debt. and the students cannot find work to pay off their debts. Now. what if you have a college loan? There is something you ought to know about it. You probably heard it. It bears repeating. There are only a handful of debts in America that you can incur as an American citizen that cannot be discharged in bankruptcy: taxesyou have to pay thosechild support. alimony. and college student loans. No matter what happens to you financially. there is virtually no way out. The loan you take out to go to college is with you for a lifetime. Even in bankruptcy you cannot discharge it. At the end of bankruptcy. it is still sitting there. Unfortunately. the interest is growing. That is why we have to take a look at it. Lets move aside from the forprofit college world. which I think is a separate issue. but a very important one. and look at the big picture. For too many Americans the promise of a fair shot at an affordable college education has become a long shot. Average tuition and fees at 4year public colleges has more than tripled in the last 30 years. I can guarantee you that income for American families has not tripled in that same period. Tuition has outpaced inflation for 32 straight years. The cost of education at all colleges and universities has been going up dramatically. No other major consumer expenditure. including health care. can make that claim. It is not just lowincome students who feel the impact of these rising costs. It is middleincome students and their families as well. Since 2003 the amount of student loan debt in America has quadrupled. Nationally there are now almost 40 million borrowers with more than $1 trillion in debt. There is more student loan debt in America today than the combined sum total of all credit card debt. That is more than there is in auto loans. Only mortgages would be a higher category of debt in terms of its total cost. The average student loan debt increased by 49 percent between 2005 and 2012 to $27.850. On average. Illinois graduates in the class of 2012 left with a little over $28.000 in debt. but their individual debts. as you might guess. are much higher. and 1.7 million Illinoisans have outstanding student loan debt out of a population of about 12.5 million. What effect does $1 trillion in student loan debt have on the American economy. The Federal Reserve warns us that it is threatening current and future economic growth. The student loan debt crisis has been compared to the mortgage crisis we went through 8 or 9 years ago. It is ingrained in American culture that each successive generation wants to do better than the previous one. But student loan debt is crippling middleclass growth for younger generations. Currently the median household wealth of people my age. in the 55to65 bracket. is 44 times the net worth of the median household of people younger than 35. People under the age of 35 are struggling. This is historically unprecedented and has a lot to do with the student loan debt. I have heard from so many people in my State about this issue. They say student loan debt is preventing them from buying a car. borrowing any more money to finish their education. having their own place to live. getting married and. once married. having children. I have met couples who have said: We made a family decision. no kids until we pay off the student loans. I am not sure we will be able to pay them off in time to make that decision. Think about that for a second. They cannot even start a family because of the student debts and the fear that they are going to default on them. I heard it firsthand back in Illinois last week. One student I met. Mabinty Tarawallie. is struggling with student loan debt even though she has done everything right. She immigrated to the United States from Africa when she was 11 years old. Her family was very poor but they told her: You have to have an education. She graduated from high school. went to a local community collegea good place to startand completed her undergraduate degree in sociology at the University of Illinois. She told me she wanted to help others pick themselves up out of poverty as she did. so she went to graduate school for a masters degree in social work. She recently graduated from a program at the University of Illinois. Although she was able to get through her undergraduate years without much debt. she spread out her graduate studies over 3 years as she was raising her family of three kids. She had one graduate assistantship. but she had to pay for the rest with loans. To compound this problem. her husband. another University of Illinois graduate student in education. also has student loans. Together. Mabinty and her husband. now that they have completed their degrees. have a debt of $150.000. One wants be a social worker and the other wants to be a teacher. Now she worries about how her family is going to be able to cope. with debt three times the annual salary she might receive as a social worker. The irony is even as a college degree becomes harder to afford for the middle class. it is more important than ever that people get educated. trained. and skilled for better jobs. Only collegeeducated workers have had wage gains in the past 30 years. If you dont go the college route. your chances of success are diminished dramatically. That is why we want to address these serious issues. This bill I am talking about. the one we are going to introduce tomorrow. will give students with college student loan debt who are current on their loans an opportunity to refinance. I talked to Mabinty and other students. It meant for her that her interest rate would come down from 6.8 percent to 3.8 percent. If you have ever gone out to get a mortgage or you know somebody who did. they will explain to you that 3 percent of your interest rate is a big deal. If you can get your interest rate reduced by 3 percent. your chances of paying off the principal are going to be a lot better. This bill I have cosponsored with ELIZABETH WARREN. JACK REED. and others is called the Bank on Students Emergency Loan Refinancing Act. It will help millions of current borrowers refinance their Federal or private student loans into these lower Federal interest rates. Those with Federal loans can refinance into lower rates. the same rates available to students who took out new loans this year. Under the Warren bill. those with private loansmany of whom have skyhigh interest rates and are facing collection agencies beating up on themcan refinance with Federal loans with lower rates and strong consumer protection. Refinancing. incidentally. is fully paid for. This is a point I want to make. because this is where we lose the other side of the aisle. This is where we cant find bipartisan cosponsorship for refinancing college loans.

Since 1939. LIRS has resettled more than 155.000 refugees through partnerships with Lutheran ministry organizations. congregations. and community people. More than 6.000 congregational sponsors were mobilized for this work. to foster the wellbeing of refugees and their integration into American life. The total number resettled includes more than 3.000 unaccompanied refugee children placed in foster care since 1978.

I think all of us agree that the only thing truly temporary about what we are being asked to do today is the brief respite we shall receive before being asked again for another temporary increase in the Federal debt ceiling. The pattern is too well known to require recitation and no one. I am sure. will make more than a feeble pretense of believing otherwise. The tendency of many in the face of this problem is to go to the wailing wall and cry: ""Is there no end?"" But there can be an end and it lies within our power to accomplish it todayhere. right now. This House has not only the power but the responsibility to put a halt to the everlasting pyramiding of our Federal debt. And while it might be helpful to place the responsiblilty for the high level of debt on other shoulders. we must face up to the fact that a great portion of that responsibility rests right here. I do not share the dire and gloomy predictions of those supporting this measure. If we do not authorize the increase. then our level of expenditures will simply be reduced. This is the only method which offers any ultimate hope of reduction of the debt and continued postponement of reality will not make it more palatable when we do decide to face it. Only by reducing expenditures and making a concerted effort to begin reduction of the debt can we ever hope to solve this problem. And it is a problem. a most serious problem. despite the lulling Intonations of those who assure us otherwise or even go so far as to regard it as a blessing. if not a necessity. Mr. Chairman. our Government has to pay bills as well as print bills. If our business firms had been run on the same basis as we have been operating. it is obvious that we would have succumbed long ago. How long can we expect fiscal sanity from others and show such flagrant disregard for it ourselves? . If deficit spending is such a wonderful stimulant to business and to increased national income. why has the course which we have followed with reckless abandon for so long failed to provide funds for some reduction in our national debt? Why can we not let our national prosperity move at a pace we can afford? Why must the Central Government pro.vide everything for everybody? Mr. Chairman. unless we pull our heads out of the clouds and make a realistic effort to live within our income. setting aside a portion for reduction of the national debt. we will be everlastingly besieged with proposals for increasing the debt.

It is the same problem in my congressional district and I am sure in all districts that border on any one of the Great Lakes. One thing that bothers me particularly is the fact that if this survey for a 3year period results in the Sanitary District of Chicago becoming accustomed to the diversion of this additional cubic feet per second of water. and then the survey determines that it is not desirable for the overall good. I doubt very much if the Sanitary District of Chicago would be willing to relinquish this added diversion. The city of Chicago and the sanitary district are making every effort they can to get this experimental additional diversion. They. in good faith. will utilize this additional diversion. perhaps construct additional facilities for sewage treatment. and subsequently. if the survey determines that for the overall good of the entire Great Lakes district this diversion should not be continued. the city of Chicago. through its officials. will be down here contending that they have a continuing right. regardless of the results of the survey. If the city of Chicago and its responsible people are willing to go on record 100 percent that they will abide by the survey. regardless. then this might be more acceptable legislation. But I have seen no one supporting this legislation. particularly those from Chicago. admit that at the end of the 3year period. if the survey is adverse. they will be willing to give up the twothirds increase in diversion. I point out this specific problem to some of my friends who have districts bordering on Lake Michigan. Many of us remember very vividly when the level of Lake Michigan was down to a disastrously low point. That was early in the 1930s. following the high water of the late 1920s. If 3 years from now. after Chicago has had this additional diversion. and it happens that the lake level is very low. those who voted to help lower it will have some reaction from their constituents.\n',move strike last word propose legislation bring same problem last session same problem congressional district sure district border thing bother fact survey period result become accustomed diversion additional cubic_foot second water survey determine desirable overall good doubt willing relinquish add diversion city sanitary district make effort get experimental additional diversion good faith utilize additional diversion construct additional facility sewage_treatment survey determine overall good entire district diversion continue city official contend continue right result survey city responsible people willing go record percent abide survey acceptable legislation see one support legislation admit end period survey adverse willing give twothird increase diversion point specific problem friend district border many remember level low point 1930 follow high water late_1920 year additional diversion happen lake level low vote help lower reaction constituents.\n,84.0,bound,1,0

Its single engine is manufactured by Rolls Royce. It will be used by the Marines as a close support aircraft. In this -respect it is similar in mission to the AX and Cheyenne. .In a research paper prepared by Senator MATHIAS and Senator PROXMIRE and Congressman SEIBERLING it is recommended that Harrier production be discontinued -after the current fiscal year. leaving 60 aircraft purchased out of the planned total run of 114. My amendment does not reach this issue. I favor the en.tire purchase of the recommended 114 Harrier aircraft. I only am attempting to limit the expense of domestic production which could run as high as $275 million over the cost of purchasing the plane from Great Britain. The current bill authorizes $23.7 million for the start of domestic production. Production of the Harrier in the United States was considered by the Congress last year and rejected then. It was rejected again by the House Armed Services Committee in its deliberations on this bill. We should not initiate it now. There have been three arguments offered in behalf of Harrier U.S. production. Let us consider these arguments in turn: First. it has been suggested that domestic production of the Harrier would alleviate unemployment in the United States. This would be true. however. only in one small area. and it is not the purpose of the defense budget to regulate the national economy. Second. it has been suggested that domestic production is needed to end U.S. dependence on a foreign source of supply for the Harrier. But there is no real likelihood that the British source of supply would be cut off. The Marines themselves and the Department of Defense are perfectly content with United Kingdom production of the Harrier. Moreover. it is unlikely that we could find American subcontractors for all the components which go into the plane. Third. It has been suggested that domestic Harrier production could establish a technological base for future V/ STOL development in the United States. The key to V/STOL development. however. is the engine. not -the airframe. Yet .at present no American company has expressed interest in domestic production of the Harriers engine. This is the central portion of the V/STOL development. In addition. the Harrier was designed in the early 1960s and some of its technology dates back even further. We might get far more for our money if we concentrated on new prototype development efforts rather than Harrier production. It should be noted that a new Navy initiative in R. & D. for V/STOL propulsion for fixedwing aircraft is already scheduled to commence in fiscal year 1972. The main argument against production of the Harrier in the United States is the high cost likely to be incurred for the marginal benefits just cited. The Marines now estimate that the additional costs could run anywhere from $113.8 to $275 million. just for the basic airframe. depending on whether the airframe alone or the entire plane were produced in the United States. If we bought an additional 84 Harriers in the United Kingdom. their unit cost would continue to be $4.4 million. If we build only the airframe in the United States. this unit cost would rise to $5.8 million for the 84 planes. And if the entire aircraft were built here. it would rise to $7.8 million. In short. U.S. production would make the Harrier either three or four times as expensive as $2 million AX. depending on the degree of U.S. production. Finally. of the total buy of 114 planes only 12 can be completely produced in the United States. This is a high price to pay275 million for 12 planes. My interest in this stems not from a desire to do the Marine Corps out of what I consider to be a firstclass airplane. I have seen this plane fly. I know its performance record. I believe it will do. in a limited way. exactly what the Marines want it to do. The payload is sacrificed tremendously when you have a short takeoff and landing airplane. In other words. one has to cut down on his fuel. on his radius of operation. on his bomb load or weapon load. Therefore. he loses a great deal of the advantage. I think the 114 planes they have intended for their present deployment is the limit of what they can use. They have no intention of increasing them. nor have they indicated any intention of increasing the 114. Mr. President.

A full century passed before there were 2 billion people on the earth. In the last 40 years. however. the population of the world has swelled to 31/2 billion people. Mankind is locked in an awesome race with the crib as a result of what has been called the medical revolution: increased longevity and declining mortality rates due to better nutrition. better hygiene. the development of miracle drugs. and the control of killer diseases. Today in the United States there are more than 200 million people. In the next three decades it is projected that we will add another 100 million. The challenge of today is how to make America livable in the tomorrow when we have an additional 100 million. Where will they live? How will we provide opportunities for a meaningful existence? Unless we act now. present trends indicate that by the year 2000. 77 percent of all Americans will live on 11 percent of the land in the continental United States. For urban Americans this will mean longer lines. more crowded public transit. choked roads and arteries. worsening slums and ghettos. the increase of crime and pollution. and rising mental illness. Overcrowding is not healthy. as a recent study by Indiana University well demonstrated. This study found that 82 percent of Manhattans population have displayed various degrees of mental illness because of living conditions in that city. Cities in general. as beneficial modes of human settlement. are in decline. As the President said in his state of the Union address: The violent and decayed central cities of our great metropolitan complexes are the most conspicuous areas of failure of American life. Today it is all too evident that. even though we call them cities. we have actually built urban deserts. In addition. to being overgrown. many of our modern cities are largely centerless. bankrupt. and monumentally ugly. The city. which the great urbanologist. Lewis Mumford. tells us was once a place of fellowship and protection. can hardly be considered so today. in fact in contemporary life. the city is all too often a place where crime and social unrest stalk the streets. where inhabitants work and reside behind locked and bolted doors. It is a place of evilsmelling fumes. dark canyons of murky air. congestion. stress. and the constant din of unregulated noise. And for too many Americans. especially black Americans. the city is a vast drab concrete establishment in many ways comparable to a prison. with too few job opportunities. too few recreation facilities. too little open space. inadequate housing. and inferior schools. As our central cities continue to deteriorate. the exodus to the suburbs goes on. Most new growth in our large metropolitan areas is taking the form of urban sprawlwhat one commentator has called the ""slurbs."" This development. which has consumed open land with a voracious appetite. has not provided a solution to our urban ills. but has only intensified them. I realize that I have painted a bleak picture of the contemporary city. but I certainly do not advocate abandoning them. in fact. there are a number of reasons for preserving and enhancing the city form. Only in the city do we have what might be termed the ""great stages"" of human existence. For as the city is the birthplace for over 70 percent of all Americans. it is likewise the place of death for those same Americans. and in the interim. the backdrop for their lives. Because it draws together so many diverse people and elements. it can offer more potential to its inhabitants in the form of cultural. social. educational. and economic advantages. As our cities grow larger and larger. however. and their problems become more and more unmanageable. the size. and complexity of these urban problems will always outdistance available resources. and our hope in meeting the challenges affecting our great metropolises. is to channel urban growth into units of more manageable and more attractive proportions. Moreover. if within the next 30 years. the Nation is to take care of the estimated population growth. it will have to double the physical plant of all of its cities. That means building twice as many schools. churches. roads. houses. airports. dumps. and parking lots as are in existence today. As one commentator has observed: This will entail the building of a Second America. What our forefathers did in three hundred years. we have to do in thirty. It is obvious that our cities cannot absorb this projected growth. however. our rural areas do not presently provide any viable alternative. because in most nonurban regions there is also a lack of opportunity and a lack of jobs. which in turn stimulates migration to the already overcrowded cities. Under these circumstances I believe we should formulate a comprehensive urban growth policy. one that will recognize the organization and nature of dispersion of our population. present. and future. over the entire United States. There should be a halt to the further concentration of our people in the cities. and I support legislation to establish a national land use policy as but one step toward this goal. Perhaps the most important aspects of such a national policy would be an expanded new towns program. . The concept of building new towns is not new. New towns have presented a solution to mans urban ills for centuries. Sweden has had a new communities policy ever since the 1940s and Great Britain in turn has had a highly successful program since the end of the Second World War. New communities in Brazil and Venezuela such as Brasilia are well known. and a large majority of the Nations urban experts favor a new towns program as desirable and important to the future. The creation of new towns could provide an alternative to the present policy of relatively haphazard national growth. would furnish places to locate the tens of millions of new Americans expected in the coming decades. could rescue the cities from many of their worsening problems. and at the same time act as a stimulus for needed rural development. In addition. new towns would provide a more pleasant and healthful environment than do most of our cities today. If cities of the future are not to be replicas of past failures. they must be planned new communities. One prominent urban authority recently said that ""We must build a new town the size of Tulsa every month for the next 30 years just to accommodate our population growth."" Admittedly this is an ambitious proposal and it will be expensive. but continued inaction in face of the awesome urban and population problems of this Nation will be even costlier. But just what is a ""new town."" There are four major types of new towns. The first typede novo new townsare totally new communities. built from the ground up. and completely selfsustaining. Satellite new towns. by comparison. are appendages of another city. more often than not bedroom communities linked by an economic umbilical cord to a larger city. The third type of new townthe newtownintownis constructed on vacant land within an existing city. Finally. there is the renovated new town. or ""new towns from small towns."" This kind of new town is built on the base of an existing small town. In this regard. a small community in northwest Missouri offers a unique opportunity for development as a new town. Pattonsburg. Mo.. could serve as a national pilot project for turning a small town into a new town. In 1928. the Corps of Engineers first proposed a plan for a flood control reservoir which would inundate Pattonsburg. and since that time this small Missouri community has lived under a cloud of uncertainty. Congress gave final approval to the entire reservoir system proposed for the Grand River Basin. of which Pattonsburg Reservoir is the largest impoundment. in 1965. and for the past 5 years the town of Pattonsburg has waited for the Government to acquire its property and for relocation on higher ground. Because the town has no future in its present location. no one is willing to make needed repairs and new investment has virtually dried up. Mayor Lloyd Pettit of Pattonsburg described the situation well in 1969: The value of our homes have fallen. our businesses have begun to shut down and move away. No longer is capital from without invested in new industries or new businesses. Every day more and more of our people begin to move away. Uncertainty and doubt hang over our heads. Our people are demoralized and afraid. We do not want to watch our towns die. we do not wish to abandon it. We would like another chance to relocate in another place. We can only do this if we receive help from our government. Under the leadership of Mayor Pettit. courageous Pattonsburg residents decided to organize and fight for their communitys survival. First. the citizens of Pattonsburg established a nonprofit development organization to serve as the coordinating agency for the planning. relocation. and development of a new town. Then. in 1969. aided by a grant from the Department of Housing and Urban Development. and in cooperation with the Missouri Department of Community Affairs. sites were explored on which to build a new town and a preliminary plan was formulated. Shortly thereafter. the 75th General Assembly of the Missouri State Legislature authorized such a town to annex a nonadjacent new townsite not more than 10 miles distant. During the past month. a proposal has been submitted to the Department of Housing and Urban Development requesting funds to plan the new town of Pattonsburg. This proposal emphasizes the fact that Pattonsburg draws together many ideal elements of new town construction: transportation. industry. recreation. and proximity to a major urban area. The town of Pattonsburg lies 65 miles north of Kansas City and 125 miles south of Des Moines. and will be linked to these two metropolises by Interstate 35. It is also served by the Norfolk & Western Railway. Pioneer Cap Factory. which is the principal employer for the city and surrounding area. is in urgent need of a new facility. and would provide the nucleus for an industrial park development designed to give the new town a diversified economic base. Perhaps the most unique aspect of the Pattonsburg proposal is the combination of a new town with a Federal reservoir. Pattonsburg Reservoir is designed to provide flood control. recreation. hydroelectric power. and water supply to the area. and if Pattonsburg follows the pattern of other reservoir developments in Missouri. we can expect tremendous economic and recreational development to follow the closing of the flood gates of the dam. If the Pattonsburg proposal is accepted. it could add a whole new dimension to water resource development in the United States. It is also evident that the new towns concept offers great latitude in dealing with the problems of rural America. Pattonsburg is located in Daviess County. a county characterized by the same discouraging pattern of outmigration and declining economy that afflicts hundreds of other rural counties in this country. Thus. it would make an ideal location for the creation of a new growth center to spur rural development in the surrounding region. At the same time. it is hoped that this kind of development would help to stem. and in time. reverse the tide of ruralurban migration which is intensifying the problems of our cities. Because the development of new towns holds great promise for rural America. a proposal similar to that submitted to HUD has been sent to the Office of Rural Development and Conservation. Department of Agriculture. Thus. I urge that all consideration be given to the Pattonsburg proposals and that funds be made available to make the new town of Pattonsburg a reality. Moreover. if we are truly serious about improving the environment and the quality of life in this country and restoring an urbanrural balance. then we should consider the importance of undertaking a massive ""new towns"" program in the years ahead. Unfortunately. it was recently announced that the administration has postponedat least for a yearsending to Congress a program for a national growth policy. which would have called for an expansion of the new communities program. The potential effects of an expensive new program on the countrys inflation problems was cited as the reason for this action. I regret that the new towns program is another victim of inflationa part of the growing list of domestic programs shoved aside so that we can continue to finance our national adventures abroad. This Nation launched the decade of the sixties with a commitment which seemed farfetched at the timeto put a man on the moon by the end of the decade. That goal. as we all know. has been achieved. With similar commitment and creativity. should we not now direct our efforts to the solution of the problems of space here on earth? We should launch the decade of the seventies with a commitment to build 300 new towns of 300.000 people each by the end of the century. This also could be a cooperative effort involving private groups and individuals. industry. and governmentState. local. and Federal. The choice is ours. We can sit idly by and watch our urban and social conditions go from bad to worse. we can watch crime rates soar. and we can be spectators to the decline of rural America and the collapse of our economy. Or. if we act nowand the creation of a national urban growth policy putting large emphasis on a massive new communities program would be a step in the right directionwe could help to rescue our dying cities from the fate that is surely theirs and instill new hope in our countryside. and in doing so. make this a better and richer land.\n'",seventh inaugurate people live planetand few border country

I would like to commend the Appropriations Committee for restoring forward funding for the senior community services employment program. title V of the Older Americans Act. The inclusion of $210 million in the urgent supplemental appropriations bill . will enable the title V program to carry the present level of 54.200 job opportunities for older Americans from July 1. 1982 through June 30. 1983. It will supplement the $66.5 thillion ir.ncluded in the continuing resolution fir a total of $277.1 million. The intent of Congress. when it passed the Older Americans Act Amendments of 1981. was to continue this vital and successful support program. The title V employment program makes it possible for senior centers and nutrition sites to more ably serve older Americans. Last year. almost half of the 54.000 older workers in this program worked in services for the elderly: Over 7.000. were in nutrition services. over 5.000. worked in senior centers. and 4.000. worked in outreach and referral services. At a hearing held in February on the food stamp and nutrition program. the Special Committee heard testimony from State and area agency on aging officials and indicated that they would have no way of replacing senior aides who are currently working in these programs. The loss of these community service jobs would have a domino effect and would threaten the ability of local agencies to continue to provide other services funded under the Older Americans Act. In addition to maintaining the title V program. the expressed intent of Congress in the Older Americans Act Amendments of 1981 was to continue the current Department of Labor ""forward funding"" practice. Section 508(b) of the act provides that amounts appropriated for any fiscal year shall be uied on a July 1June 30 basis. The urgent supplemental. therefore brings the appropriation process into conformity with the authorizing legislation. The restoration of $210.5 million for the community services employment for older Americans in the urgent supplemental. along with the $66.5 million authorized by the continuing resolution (Public Law 9792) for fiscal 1982. will provide a total of $277 million for this program. As noted in the Appropriation Committees report. this is the same level of funding as the fiscal year 1981 appropriation and the fiscal year 1982 budget request. It will continue to support 54.200 part time job opportunities for older personsthe same number of Job slots as authorized under the Older Americans Act Amendments of 1981. Mr. President. several weeks ago the Senate passed the first concurrent budget resolution. In effect. that resolution places a freeze on nondefense discretionary programs. Essentially. it holds many programs. including title V. at the same levels as those appropriated in fiscal year 1982. Therefore. the inclusion of the $210 million in this appropriations bill is consistent with the level of funding provided under the budget resolution. The importance of employment opportunities to the economic security. the health. and the personal fulfillment of older Americans is a critical concern to all of us. We know that the vast majority of older men and women want to have the opportunity to continue some form of work. I believe title V can help fulfill that opportunity. It is a program that has demonstrated the significant contributions older workers can and do make to our society. and I will continue to urge my colleagues to maintain their strong support of this important program.\n'",chairman like commend restore funding senior community service employment program title inclusion urgent_supplemental appropriation bill enable title_v program carry present level job opportunity old supplement thillion ir.nclude continue resolution fir total intent pass continue vital successful support program title_v employment program make possible senior center nutrition site serve old last year half old worker program work service elderly nutrition service work senior center work outreach referral service hearing hold food_stamp nutrition program hear testimony area agency age official indicate way replace senior aide work program loss community service job domino_effect threaten ability local agency continue provide other service fund addition maintain title_v program express intent continue current fund practice section act provide amount appropriate fiscal year uied 1june basis urgent_supplemental bring appropriation process conformity authorize legislation restoration community service employment old urgent_supplemental authorize continue resolution fiscal provide total program note report same level funding fiscal year appropriation fiscal year budget request continue support part time job opportunity old same number slot authorize several week pass first concurrent budget resolution effect resolution place freeze nondefense_discretionary program hold many program include title same level appropriate fiscal year inclusion appropriation bill consistent level funding provide budget resolution importance employment opportunity economic security health personal fulfillment old critical concern know vast_majority old man woman want opportunity continue form work believe title help fulfill opportunity program demonstrate significant contribution old worker make society continue urge colleague maintain strong support important program.\n,97.0,daily,1,0

I was disheartened by a recent story in the Washington Star concerning a trucker whose business has been apparently destroyed needlessly by the misguided regulation of the Interstate Commerce Commission. Since shortly after World War II. James H. Carter. whom I assume is no relation to a certain nominee for national office. operated a moderately large trucking firm. In 1969. Carter purchased from another firm an ICC certificate giving him the authority to transport store mannikins and supplies used in connection with store displays. Carter interpreted this liberally to mean that he could transport anything which could be displayed in a store. and this he did. When Carter applied for an official ICC interpretation of his certificate in 1972. it was taken as an application to transport practically anything between New York City and any place east of the Mississippi. The ICC investigated Carter. and despite the fact that the firm from which Carter bought the permit had used it as he did. Carter was fined for overstepping and thus violating the terms of his certificate. The ICC decided that the certificate meant to include only mannikins and window dressing. although what it actually said was admittedly ambiguous. On Carters application for a broad certificate. the ICC eventually ruled that he was unfit to perform the service he proposed. despite the fact that they had previously fined him for performing that service for over 400 customers. According to Carter. ""The ruling put me out of business."" Mr. President. the problem here is that a successful businessman has been financially destroyed and cannot perform a useful service. In a reversal of its usual procedure. the ICC decided in this case to stand by what it meant rather than what it said. It then ruled contrary to commonsense when it decided that Carter could not perform the service he had. in fact. performed successfully for many years. This case crystallizes several issues concerning the need for. and the proper extent of. Government regulation of private industry. In this instance. the ICC does not seem to have promoted either the interest of the consumer or industrial efficiency and safety. Too often. in cases such as this. regulatory agencies stifle competition. impose costly delays. reduce productivity. and damage industrys adaptability and flexibility. This inevitably leads to some inflated prices and loss of jobs. I believe farreaching legislation to reform and make sense out of the overall mission. structure. and operation of our regulatory agencies should be a priority concern of the Congress. Nonsensical and pernicious regulation not only strangles smaller businesses such as Mr. Carters. but cuts to the heart of even our largest corporations ability to produce and compete in world markets. If we do not address this terribly important question soon. we face the risk of allowing our productive system to permanently lose its vitality. During this session of the Congress. Senator ROBERT BYRD and I introduced S. 2812. We think it offers the correct approach to regulatory reform. It mandates a procedure for reform. leaving the actual substance flexible. S. 2812 provides that reform will be comprehensive. covering five broad areas of regulation over 5 years. Most importantly. the bill requires certain reasonable deadlines for executive and congressional action on reform. If either branch fails to meet its deadlines. there are disciplines built into the legislation to prevent an impasse. The measure provides an incentive for special interests and the agencies themselves to cooperate in this comprehensive. actionoriented reform program. In this light. I commend the Washington Star and its reporter Stephen M. Aug for his excellent and timely story on Mr. Carters plight. It is but a symptom of how much in disarray are the regulatory policies of this Nation. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that this article from the September 10.

Prior to the July 4th recess. my colleagues. Senator KENNEDY and Senator ALLEN. and I brought to light the plight of North Korean refugees in a hearing before the Immigration Subcommittee. The hearing capped a month of activity that involved the passage of resolution on North Korean refugees in both the House and the Seante. Both resolutions strongly urged the Chinese government not to repatriate North Korean refugees back to North Korea. The House version passed by 406 to 0 and our resolution passed by unanimous consent on June 19. 2002. At our hearing. we heard some very moving testimony from Ms. Lee SoonOk. a North Korean defector who suffered more than five years in a prison camp. We also heard from Ms. Helie Lee. a Korean American writer whose memoir. In the Absence of the Sun. movingly highlighted a largely hidden and painful secret shared by hundreds of thousands of Korean Americans and millions of Koreans--more than 50 years of separation among family members and loved ones since the outbreak of the Korean War. Few other country and its people has suffered as much. In addition. Mr. President. I urged Secretary Powell in both a formal consultation and by correspondence on the need of our Department of State to allow the processing of North Korean refugees together with the Chinese government and the Beijing office of the United Nations High Commissioner on Refugees. The plight of North Korean refugees. of course. is merely a symptom of a far more pressing issuehow to deal with one of the most repressive and totalitarian states in the world. the isolated country of North Korea ruled by one man. Kim Jongil. Although news regarding the efforts of many in the NGO community and countless others working in North East China have been slowly filtering into the West. the true nature of the North Korean regime is largely hidden and inaccessible. It was not until the showing of a dramatic video of five members of the Hanmee family being forcibly removed from the Japanese consulate in Beijing that the world began to pay attention. Since then. several other asylum bids have drawn the attention of mainstream media. including the horrifying story of babykillings in North Korean prison camps reported in the New York Times and based on the testimony of Ms. Soon Ok Lee. who. as I indicated before. testified at our hearing. In June 2002. ABC Nightime broadcast a threepart documentary of the North Korean refugee in China by Ms. Kim Jungeun whose schedule did not permit her to testify before our committee. I was told by ABC News staff that thousands of Americans have responded to the broadcast with emails in disbelief and in rage against the North Korean regime. I understand that the three programs drew high response from viewers. It is estimated that between 2 to 3 million people died of starvation and persecution in North Korea from 1995 through 1998 and that up to up to 300.000 North Korean refugees in China are living a precarious and dangerous life. hiding by day. begging by night. in an effort to avoid being captured and repatriated back to North Korea by Chinese and North Korean agents brazenly operating inside China Of the 300.000 refugees. only 518 refugees successfully defected to South Korea this year through June 2002. many of them by taking refuge at foreign missions in Beijing and in Shenyang. China. These actions by the Chinese are simply unacceptable. not. only to basic principles and tenets of international human rights. but also by the fact that China is a signatory of the International Refugees Convention.. Hundreds of South Korean. Japanese and western NGOs are working inside China to help the refugees. risking their lives and capture by the Chinese police. A German doctor who also testified before our committee worked in North Korea for a year and a half but was evicted by the North Korean regime for disclosing the tragedies of the NK people. People like him and others on the ground in China and Korea have been some of the most vocal and active in their effort to make the whole world aware of the conditions in North Korea and China. Many NGOs have taken care of refugee families fulltime with their own money. Ive met with many of these people. all of whom are now effectively shut down from operating in China. And what they tell me over and over is that they simply cannot not ignore what they saw. All of them said to me that they could not look away and ignore the refugees. many of whom were too scared to even beg for help. These NGOs from South Korea. Japan. the U.S.. France. and Germany. first reported the tragedy of the North Koreans to the outside world. These NGOs who are in the best position to know report that food aid from South Korea. the U.S.. and Japan. simply are not reaching the dying people. As I mentioned in a previous statement. I believe it is absolutely necessary to condition stringent monitoring of the delivery of food aid by NGOs in an effort to determine that they are being distributed appropriately. Much of this aid is apparently being diverted to feed the millionplus North Korean army and to reward the elites and the inner circle around Kim Jongil in Pyongyang. For this reason. many wellrespected NGOs. including Doctors Without Borders have withdrawn from North Korea. More troubling is that these NGOs have confirmed reports of more than a dozen prison camps in North Korea. where the prisoners are starved. forced to work at hard labor. and tortured to death. Aside from the troubling refugee issue. we cannot forget that North Korea is a threat to regional and global security. North Korea continues its procurement of materials and components for its ballistic missile programs from foreign sources. especially through North Korean firms based in China. In addition. North Korea has become a ""secondary supplier"" of missile technology and expertise to several countries in the Middle East. South Asia and North Africa. The CIAs 2001 report assesses that North Korea is capable of producing and delivering via missile warheads or other munitions a variety of chemical agents and possibly some biological. Furthermore. North Korea refuses to carry out its obligations under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. NPT and the 1994 Agreed Framework. Initial IAEA. International Atomic Energy Agency. inspections and intelligence reports in the early 1990s triggered concerns regarding a clandestine nuclear weapons program. U.S. and foreign intelligence have concluded that the DPRK government of North Korea probably has sufficient plutonium for 1 to 5 nuclear weapons. Despite its obligations under the NPT and the Agreed Framework. North Korea continues to refuse inspections. So while it would be reason enough to continue our pressure on North Korea and China for the humanitarian violations alone. there are also the pressing security threats that the current North Korean government poses to U.S. interests which must be dealt with. While refugee and nuclear weapons issues will necessitate very different responsesthe thing they share in common is the alarms they raise about ignoring the North Korean problem in all its complexity. While I am mindful of the diplomatic sensitivities regarding the need to reach out to the North Korean regime. there comes a time when we have to confront the truth and tell the truth. Moreover. reconciliation efforts have yet to yield any results. There was much hope after the historic meeting between President Kim Dae Jung and Jongil in June 2000. that such a gesture would bring about some meaningful change. As the naval skirmish last month and the continuing problems with the North Korean refugees show. the North Korean issue has simply worsened. Its time for the North Korean regime to immediately allow international monitoring of food aid into the country and to work with the international NGO community to alleviate the suffering of its people. That may at least stem the tide of refugees crossing over into China and being prey to human traffickers and other difficulties faced by refugees. But more fundamentally. the North regime itself must begin to change itself and join the rest of the world in giving hope and freedom to its people. The U.S. can not afford to give into the slowwalking of reforms in North Korea. For our own security. for the stability of the region and for the sake of basic human rightsNorth Korea must remain a top policy focus for U.S. foreign policy. We must keep clear and constant pressure on NK and neighboring countries to bring new leadership into- being. This is a daunting task. but one that we can not afford to shirk. We have significant refugee flight taking place out of North Korea. We have had hearings in the Senate Immigration Committee on this particular topic. We have a humanitarian crisis. probably the largest in the world. that is taking place. We estimate that there are between 2 to 3 million people who have died of starvation and persecution in North Korea from 1995 to 1998. in a 3year time period2 to 3 million people. Nobody knows for sure because outside observers are not allowed. This Nation is the most repressive. closed regime in the world today. The world community is feeding those who are left in North Korea. The United States and a number of other donating countries are feeding about half of the population in North Korea. Much of the food aid we are giving North Korea is not getting out to where it is needed. It. is still held by the leadership in that country. We estimate that some 300.000 North Korean refugees are living in China today in a precarious and dangerous lifestyle. They are hiding by day and begging by night. trying to keep from being caught and sent back into North Korea. which is what China does. If they catch people from North Korea. they treat them as economic migrants and ship them back into starvation. refugee camps. persecution. and probably death. Of the 300.000 refugees in China. only 518 refugees have successfully defected. gotten out of China and into South Korea or into another third countrythat is this year. through June of 2002. Many of them have done it by taking refugee status at foreign missions in Beijing and Shenyang. China. They have rushed embassies in those communities. gotten inside. asked for political asylum. it has been granted. and they passed to South Korea. generally through a third countrymany times through the Philippines. I say only 518 this year. If you look at the history since the Korean conflict has endednow 50 years agothere have been only several thousand who have defected from North Korea into South Korea. Generally. each year. it has been a tricklemaybe in the teens. The North Korean regime has been able to keep people in a dogmatic system. saying this regime is the best in the world and saying they are being fed by the President and the leadership. Now that trickle is beginning to really move. They believe it may be up to a thousand. there may be a thousand or more defecting this year alone. which is a massive number considering the history. Mr. President. the issue I want to bring to light is the role of China and the importance of China in allowing these people to live. If China will allow these people to pass through. or if China will allow the U.N. Commission. or the High Commission on Refugees to establish a processing center to determine if these are people who need to be allowed to pass into third countries. thousands if not millions of people will not have to live in North Korea. If China does not. you are going to see thousands. possibly millions more. die of starvation. persecution. and other causes. China has a choice. They will choose what the status is going to be. whether these people will live or die. They need to be confronted directly and asked to let these people live. to let them pass through. Let them pass through to Mongolia. to South Korea. to other places. but dont send them back. If they dont want to have them stay in China. allow some place for them to go through. such as a refugee center. But. China. make the choice. It is your responsibility and their blood -that will be on your call as to what you determine you are going to do in this particular situation. North Korea is a country that is difficult for us or anybody else in the world to influence. China is the only country in the world that has some influence on North Korea. So it is going to be their choice as to whether these people will live or die. North Korea needs to change its regime. I dont need to remind Members of the Senate of the other problems we have with North Korea. They are a supplier of weapons. North Korea has become a secondary supplier of missile technology and expertise to several countries in the Middle East. South Asia. and North Africa. The CIAs 2001 report assesses that North Korea is capable of producing and delivering via missile warheads. or other munitions. a variety of chemical agents and possibly some biological agents as well. Mr. President. I draw this to the attention of my colleagues because we need to allow refugees to pass and come into the United States as well. We will be bringing this issue up again in front of this body. I hope we will put pressure on China. which doesnt have a good human rights re6ord. so that they can act to save peoples livesif they will only allow these people to pass through. Mr. President.

I rise in support of H.R. 4584. the Omnibus Drug Enforcement. Education and Control Act. which authorizes funding for a wide variety of programs designed to strengthen the enforcement of drug laws. stem the flow of illegal drugs into the country. increase penalties for illegal drug activities. expand Federal prison facilities. and assist drug education and treatment to prevent drug abuse. This bipartisan legislation is the product of the combined efforts of 12 House committees and incorporates all or part of 20 drugrelated bills previously introduced in the House of Representatives. It is the most sweeping drug control measure ever considered by Congress. and I am pleased to be a cosponsor of this important initiative. House consideration of this comprehensive proposal is recognition of this bodys concern about the tremendous toll which the drug problem is taking on the fabric of our society. It also reflects growing sentiment throughout the country that the Federal Government should take the lead in controlling this national problem and repesents tacit acknowledgement that past and current antidrug. efforts have been insufficient. The fact of the matter is that for years Washington has bungled the battle against illegal drugs. We seem to be forever launching a new antidrug campaign which. after the initial fanfare. quickly recedes into. the background. while the human cost of illegal drugs grows ever greater. The magnitude of the drug problem in our country dictates that we can no longertolerate occasional pronouncements of concern followed by prolonged periods of inaction. It is time to take serious. comprehensive action against the drug problem. The ""war on drugs"" must move from the realm of empty rhetoric to that of grim reality. We have an opportunity to initiate such action today through passage of the Omnibus Drug Enforcement. Education. and Control Act. This legislation holds ral promise for progress in the fight against drugs. The key to this effort is the word comprehensive. For the first time. we could have an antidrug program that does not pretend the problem can be solved just by intercepting drug shipments or just by educating users or just by attacking drugs at their source. The fact is that illegal drugs must be fought at every stage: in the countries where they originate. at points of entry into the United States where they may be interecepted. on the streets where they are sold. in the homes and schools where education against their use must be delivered. and at the clinics where their users can be rehabilitated. That is the approach embodied in the bipartisan Omnibus Drug Enforcement. Education and Control Act. \x95 H.R. 5484 .seeks to strengthen interdiction and eradication efforts and improve drug enforcement education. research and education. Specifically. it would: 1. Increase penalties for various narcotics offenses and mandate a prison term of 20 years to life imprisonment for drug trafficking and manufacturing that results in serious injury or death. 2. Authorize additional funds for numerous drugrelated law enforcement activities. including additional Drug Enforcement Administration [DEA] efforts. prison construction. and State and local drug enforcement assistance. 3. Increase funding for the Coast Guard to provide for more personnel and equipment to help stop the flow of illegal drugs into the country. 4. Increase Customs Service authorization to improve drug interdiction. 5. Make it easier to detect and prosecute money laundering. which is frequently used by drug traffickers to hide their illicit profits. 6. Require drugproducing countries to establish eradication programs as a condition of U.S. support for multilateral development bank aid. 7. Impose trade sanctions on drugproducing or exporting nations that refuse to cooperate with U.S. antidrug efforts. 8. Provide additional funds for drug interdiction and eradication programs in foreign countries. 9. Permit U.S. agents to accompany foreign police on drug raids. 10. Authorize funding for Defense Department procurement of antidrug equipment and assign Coast Guard personnel to Navy ships to make arrests in drug smuggling areas. 11. Create grant programs for local drug education and treatment programs and fund Indian drug abuse programs. 12. Mandate Federal drug education programs and a demonstration program to determinethe feasibility and cost of drug treatment under Federal heath plans. and I I 13. Require the President to recommend a -reorganization of executive :agencies to better combat drug trafficking and abuse. Mr.. Speaker. there is. no problem more tragic to the families it destroys. or more men.acing to our society and its citizens. than drug abuse. Defeating drugs will take the combined. continuing efforts of the President. both parties in Congress and. especially. the public. The Omnibus Drug Enforcement. Education and Control Act is a realistic centerpiece for this. effort. I urge my colleagues to vote for H.R. 5484. and I hope that the Senate will follow the Houses lead on this important .issue so that a comprehensive antidrug bill can be sent to the President to be signed into law this year.\n'",rise support authorize funding wide_variety program design strengthen enforcement drug law stem flow illegal drug country increase penalty illegal drug activity expand prison facility assist drug education treatment prevent drug abuse bipartisan legislation product combine effort committee incorporate part drugrelated bill introduce sweeping drug control measure consider pleased cosponsor important initiative house consideration comprehensive proposal recognition bodys concern tremendous toll drug problem take fabric society reflect grow sentiment country take lead control national problem repesent tacit_acknowledgement past current antidrug effort insufficient fact matter year bungle battle illegal drug seem launch new antidrug campaign initial fanfare recede background human cost illegal drug grow great magnitude drug problem country dictate longertolerate occasional pronouncement concern follow prolong period inaction time take serious comprehensive action drug problem war drug move realm empty_rhetoric grim_reality opportunity initiate such action today passage education legislation hold ral promise progress fight drug key effort word comprehensive first time program pretend problem solve intercept drug shipment educate user attack drug source fact illegal drug fight stage country originate point entry interecepte street sell home school education use deliver clinic user rehabilitate approach embody bipartisan strengthen interdiction_eradication effort improve drug enforcement education research education increase penalty various narcotic offense mandate prison term year life imprisonment drug_trafficking manufacturing result serious injury death authorize additional fund numerous drugrelated law enforcement activity include additional effort prison construction local drug enforcement assistance increase funding provide more personnel equipment help stop flow illegal drug country increase authorization improve drug_interdiction make easy detect prosecute money_laundering use drug_trafficker hide illicit profit require drugproducing country establish eradication program condition support multilateral bank aid impose trade sanction drugproducing export nation refuse cooperate antidrug effort provide additional fund drug_interdiction eradication program foreign country agent accompany foreign police drug raid authorize funding procurement equipment assign personnel ship make arrest drug_smuggling area create grant program local drug education treatment program fund indian drug abuse program drug education program demonstration program feasibility cost drug treatment federal heath plan require recommend -reorganization executive agency well combat drug_trafficking abuse problem tragic family destroy more men.acing society citizen drug abuse defeat drug take combine continue effort party public realistic centerpiece effort urge colleague vote hope follow lead important .issue comprehensive antidrug bill send sign law year.\n,99.0,daily,0,1

I am really shocked at the callous indifference to the destiny of the people of South Vietnam shown by the suggestion of the candidate of the opposition that they be entirely disarmed and left helpless before an advancing army. Moreover. the proposals. involving not only unilateral withdrawal but unilateral disarmament. go beyond even the proposals made by Hanoi. because Hanoi. as quoted only on last nights television. has indicated its willingness to negotiate the question of U.S. military materiel in South Vietnam. This speech is singularly ill timed and singularly wrongly motivated. coming as it does during a period when the negotiations with the north never have been more sensitive and when there has never been more reason not to upset the apple cart. In previous campaigns and in the administration of previous Presidents. this kind of thing was not done. It is being done now because the candidate is desperate. It does raise certain questions. For example. why again propose amnesty without any conditions of national service? Why simply say. ""If I were doing it. I would offer national service?"" There is no requirement. no condition of that. it is absolute. unconditional amnesty 90 days after he would take office. because that is the time within which the candidate of the opposition says he would end the war. So in 90 days amnesty is proposed. Moreover. on this question of materiel. if it be argued that the title of the materiel has passed to South Vietnam. then there is no materiel to bring home and the offer is a hoax. If. on the other hand. it is U.S. rifles. artilleries. or planes regardless of whether title presently is in the United States or South Vietnam. how does the candidate propose to get the materiel to the United States out of South Vietnam? Forcibly? By violence? Does he plan to take it away from the South Vietnamese and start another war. or does he think the materiel will be given up while these people allow themselves to be unilaterally disarmed and left weakly helpless and waiting for the slaughtering enemy coming down in hordes from the north?

It is not my intention at this time to go into all the arguments pro and con as to the reasons for or against assistance to Yugoslavia at the present time but I shall take 5 minutes to point out what I believe to be a very serious inconsistency that I want the committee to be in full cognizance of before voting on this bill. The report of the conference committee on the authorization bill for mutual security contained this section which was not in the original bill as passed by the House. Language similar to it was inserted in the Senate version of the mutual security authorization and the conference agreed on this language: It is the purpose of this act to advance the cause of freedom. The Congress joins with the President of the United States in proclaiming the hope that the peoples who have been subjected to the captivity of Communist despotism shall again enjoy the right of selfdetermination within a framework which will sustain the peace. that they shall again have the right to choose the form of government under which they will live. and that sovereign rights of selfgovernment shall be restored to them all in accordance with the pledge of the Atlantic Charter. Funds available under this section may be used for programs of information. relief. exchange of persons. education. and resettlement. to encourage the hopes and aspirations of peoples who have been enslaved by communism. In other words all embracing with respect to communism. Mr. Chairman. the people of Yugoslavia eminently qualify for assistance under this particular section. Now. Mr. Chairman. I would like to call the committees attention to page 3 of the legislation we are discussing at the present time. line 12: Special Presidential fund: For assistance authorized by section 401 (b) $100 million. In other words. we have here a $100 million authorization for refugees. escapees. or what have you from all Communistcontrolled countries and. according to the language of the authorization bill. that would include Yugoslavia. I think the Committee is faced with this inconsistency. Mr. Chairman: We are being asked on the one hand to appropriate money for escapees and refugees from Communistdominated countries. including Yugoslavia. On the other hand. we are being asked to appropriate an unspecified amount of money for the very Communist country from which some of these escapees and refugees are fleeing to seek independence in the free world.

Mr. Chairman. I rise in opposition to the amendment offered by the gentleman from Ohio . I recognize that cost accounting standards and accounting propriety is something that we all support and seek and we want to make sure that it is done. The difficulty. of course. is that this particular provision has been carried in this bill since 1998 at the request of the authorizing committee. namely the Committee on Government Reform. Why? Because. as the Office of Personnel Management has told us. the accounting standards that through the CAS are sought to be applied to insurance carriers through the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan. as OPM told us. are in ""incompatible conflict"" with the accounting standards that are used within the insurance industry. I think that the Chairman. as well. as many Members. are aware that there are accounting differences depending on the type of business. whether it is a publicly held corporation. whether it is a partnershipor small business. whether it is a public utility. or in this case whether we are talking about an insurance .company. The concern is this: If we adopt this amendment. we may force out of the market insurance carriers that provide coverage to hundreds of thousands of Federal workers by arbitrarily and immediately cutting them off. I do not want to see hundreds- of thousands of people lose their insurance benefits or be told now they have to shop around and find a different carrier under the FEHBP just because we made a quick and not fully informed decision on the floor of the House that we wanted to take some regulation that was meant to apply to other types of companies and apply them to insurance carriers under the FEHBP. That is my concern with the gentlemans amendment. His desire to make sure that we have accounting propriety is well taken. but let us make sure that we do that in a reasoned way. Let us make sure that we go back to the authorizers. the Committee on Government Reform that originally asked for this provision to be carried in this bill several years ago. ask them to look at it. look at it in proper depth and with correct understanding of the accounting differences for different types of businesses. I have been informed that more than half of all Federal employees could have their insurance coverage put at risk if we adopt the amendment of the gentleman from Ohio . Members may agree or disagree that that is the case. but I for one do not want to take the chance without having -a much more informed understanding of this situation. It is a very technical amendment. It is a technical circumstance. The gentleman has excellent motives. but I think it is also an excellent motive to protect the insurance coverage of half or more of the Federal workers that we have in the United States.

The purpose was to establish a mechanism to create a special coordinating program for artists when the national unemployment rate exceeds 6.5 percent. . In the course of debate. Members on both sides of the aisle indicated that they were sympathetic to the objectives of the amendment but felt that it more properly would obtain In connection with the CETA bill which we are considering today. Pursuant to that suggestion. the Members may recall that I asked unanimous consent at that time to withdraw my amendment and indicated that I would take the suggestion of the members of the Committee on Education and Labor to bring up this amendment in connection with the CETA act today and I am doing so. Mr. Chairman. in June of 1973. in recognition of the severe impact which recessions have on artists. the House Subcommittee on Select Education requested special studies to examine the problem of unemployment in the theater. According to the most recent information from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. approximately 7 percent of our Nations artists. writers and entertainers are unemployed. Yet. of all the available public service employment positions less than 1 percent have been allocated to artists. When Congress enacted title VI of the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act many of us hoped that prime sponsors would take advantage of this opportunity to employ persons in the arts. At that time. Nancy Hanks. Chair of the National Endowment for the Arts. contacted all executive and legislative leaders of State and local governments urging them to recognize the arts and cultural activities in their employment plans. She pointed out the role these individuals might play in education. graphic design and visual arts. as well as in architecture. The adaptive use of existing public structures has become an increasingly attractive alternative to new construction. Many of us are familiar with the fine work the city of Boston has accomplished in transforming its waterfront buildings to new offices and apartments. I know that my colleague from New Jersey is extremely interested in such programs for railroad depots. Ms. Hanks pointed out in her testimony to the Select Education Subcommittee that the theater. art. music. and writers projects of the 1930s were extremely important in providing opportunities to talented people. beautifying our public places. and enriching the public and cultural life of the country. At its midwinter meeting in 1975 the U.S. Conference of Mayors adopted a resolution recognizing the economic hardships facing artists and their importance as a vital resource contributing to the quality of life in the urban environment. Nevertheless. it is clear that artists have been neglected in public service employment. The optimistic hopes voiced by one delegate to last years meeting of the National Council on the Arts that 10 percent of the CETA jobs would be for artists have remained unfulfilled. Mr. Chairman. among the lessons we have learned from our experiences in public service employment during our Nations previous depression is the importance of targeting jobs programs to mesh with the skills of those who are unemployed. Similarly. efforts should be made to locate projects where they will serve the greatest unemployment needs. We would not impose geographic conditions on the disbursement of funds to scientists. Neither should they be imposed on artists. Mr. Chairman. the arts are a labor intensive industry. As such. they generate a significant ripple effect in the economy. The Associated Councils of the Arts undertook a study to examine this industry. It showed that for every dollar spent on the arts directly by the Government. an additional one and one half dollars are generated in terms of ancillary activities. These benefits come from tourism. transportation. restaurant expenses and increased business for the vast number of suppliers of arts related equipment and maintainence. and increased employment for construction workers. The value of arts to communities has been supported by studies in such diverse communities as New York City. Chicago. Atlanta. Philadelphia. and Ashland. Oreg.. as well as in a statewide study in Rhode Island. Mr. Chairman. this bill will put our Nations artists to work in a program that will improve the quality of community life.

I am convinced by testimony recently heard by the Subcommittee on Labor of the Committee on Labor and Welfare. of which I am a member. that the mining of coal as is now being conducted in this country is an extremely hazardous occupation. I am further of the opinion that were all the safety and health provisions of the pending bills enacted. a great deal of risk would remain for the men who go into mines. "" Coal is a vital element of our national industrial complex. I need not enumerate the ways that coal contributes to our economy. Suffice it to say that it is our most important and valuable mineral. We must have coal. How then can we utilize this product without endangering the lives of men? I suggest that we should look outside the conventional methods and strike out in a new. untried. even revolutionary direction. What are the principal dangers to men when working underground? They are cavein. water. dust pollution. and explosion. The first two are mechanical and physical and can be best controlled by adequate safety laws and frequent inspections to insure compliance. The last two I believe can be best controlled by having the miner work in a completely controlled environment. How do we handle mans survival in a completely hostile environment? We put our astronauts and aquanauts in space suits and diving gear. They breathe pure air. their bodily responses are closely monitored. Are not our miners entitled to an equal amount of concern? Their environment at work will not kill them instantly as in outer space or underwater work. but their environment can kill them just as surely. I know there are those who will dismiss out of hand the proposal that a miner work in a space suit. This Buck Rogers Idea will no doubt provide considerable amusement around the mine and in the board rooms of coal corporations. But I believe that some day coal will be safely mined in this manner. There are other advantages. A mine could be completely sealed. filled with an inert gas such as helium. and a few pounds of pressure maintained. This would retard the invasion of water. Without oxygen. there could be no oxidation. which causes water pollution. The valuable methane gas. now lost. could be recovered. Of course. the obvious and immediate benefit would be complete relief from air pollution and resulting ""black lung"" and complete removal of explosion danger. since the inert. pressurized gas would not support even the weakest explosion. Eliminating temperature changes and maintaining a constant temperature inside the mine would prevent cracking and other physical damage that changing temperatures would cause. Mechanical problems of maintaining a sealed mine would be substantial. It would indeed be awkward for a machine operator to spend his day in something resembling a space suit. But I submit that this might be the most workable solution if we are earnest in our desire to prevent prolonged misery and death of the men who work underground in search of our most precious mineral. I understand that at least one coal company has discussed what I am proposing today. and contemplates further research. But I know of no present experiments in this type of mining. I firmly believe that the miners. the companies. and the Government should work together for such a model unit. To proceed with dispatch is not only desirable. It is a necessity.\n'",convince testimony hear member mining coal conduct country hazardous_occupation further opinion safety health provision pende bill enact great deal risk remain man go mine coal vital element national industrial complex need enumerate way coal contribute economy suffice say important valuable mineral coal utilize product endanger life man suggest look conventional method strike new untried revolutionary direction principal danger man work water dust pollution explosion first mechanical physical control adequate safety law frequent inspection insure compliance last believe control have miner work control environment handle man survival hostile environment put astronaut aquanaut space suit diving_gear breathe pure air bodily response monitor miner entitle equal amount concern environment work kill outer_space underwater work environment kill know dismiss hand proposal miner work space suit provide considerable amusement mine board room coal corporation believe day coal_mine manner other advantage mine seal fill inert gas such helium few pound pressure maintain retard invasion water oxygen oxidation cause water pollution valuable methane_gas lose recover obvious immediate benefit complete relief air_pollution result black_lung complete removal explosion danger inert pressurize gas support weak explosion eliminate temperature change maintain constant temperature mine prevent cracking other physical damage change temperature cause mechanical problem maintain sealed mine substantial awkward machine operator spend day resemble space suit submit workable_solution earnest desire prevent prolong misery death man work search precious mineral understand coal company discuss propose today contemplate further research know present experiment type mining believe miner company work model unit proceed dispatch desirable necessity.\n,91.0,bound,1,0

I thank the chairman of the Finance Committee for putting forward this legislation. This is the marriage penalty tax. It has been before this body. We passed it with 61 votes in favor of it. and 9 Democrats voted in favor of this bill. Almost the entire Republican side voted for this bill. Now we have a conference report in front of us. I hope people will look at this and look at what is in the conference report. That is why I wanted to take some time to go through it. It is a 5year package. $89 billion. I dont want people saying it is $250 billion or anything. it is an $89 billion package. It only hits the 15percent tax bracket. There has been concern about the 28percent bracket being hit. It doesnt include the 28percent bracket. The House side has & 15percent bracket in dealing with the marriage penalty but not the 28percent bracket. So we went with the House side and said: OK. we will pull out the 28percent bracket. So it is just that 15percent bracket. It is phased in faster than the Senate bill that passed. It does continue to contain the earnedincome tax provisions within it so that married couples who are currently being hit by a marriage penalty associated with the earnedincome tax credit are no longer impacted by that. This is an overall excellent bill that meets virtually everybodys suggestions.that they were making about this bill. I hope we can get 100 percent support within the Senate for this bill. It eliminates the marriage penalty built into the standard deduction effective back to the beginning of this year. It backs it up to the beginning of the year 2000. It widens the 15percent bracket gradually so that joint filing is two times that of singles. It starts at the beginning of this year. and is fully effective by the year 2004. In other words. we are taking that 15percent bracket for twowage earners. or spouses with combined incomes. or even only one spouse. and we are doubling the standard deduction. We are doing it up until 2004. It increases the top phaseout amount of the earnedincome tax creditthe provision I was talking about earlierfor joint filers by $2.000 effective to the beginning of this year. again. the beginning of the year 2000. It sunsets the tax relief provisions in accordance with the Byrd rule at the end of 2004. I want to make sure to point out that provision to people as well. This is a 5year marriage penalty elimination for the 15percent tax bracket and earnedincome tax credit. That is basically what the package is. I think it should contain more. I think we ought to have the 28percent bracket as well on combined incomes. We couldnt get agreement to that in the House. We did on the 15percent bracket. I direct most of my statement tonight to the administration. This is going to pass. It is going to pass strong. We have had a lot of calls and contacts in our office from people saying: Of course you shouldnt tax marriage. Lets do away with this penalty. That is what we are simply pleading to the President. After tomorrow morning when this passes with at least 61 votes. this will be on the administrations desk. It is up to the President and Vice President to determine whether they are going to sign this tax cut. Are we going to sign this tax correction and send to the American people. or are we going to veto it? The President has been saying: OK. Send me prescription drugs and I will sign the marriage penalty. In the State of the Union Message. he said: Lets deal with the marriage penalty tax. and lets eliminate it. He didnt say then that you have to send this to me at the same time. He asked for a hundred things in the State of the Union Message. He didnt say they have to be linked together. I think he is hiding behind that issue rather than saying whether he is for or against eliminating the marriage penalty within the Tax Code. I call on the President to sign this for the American people. After tomorrow morning. the President and the Vice President and this administration are all that stands in the way of the American people being able to receive this correction within the Tax Code so people who are married dont pay more taxes than people who are single. It simply makes equitable a situation for most people impacted by the marriage penalty. not all. It would be better if it dealt with everybody. It is a simple statement that we should not be taxing marriage. We have said that repeatedly. For most people impacted by the marriage penalty. this bill will deal with that situation. We will not be taxing people just for being married. Plus. I think it is just the right message to send across to the American public saying we think marriage is a valuable institution. it shouldnt be taxed. We think it is at the center of family values. Lets all say we are for it and that we shouldnt be taxing it. Also. it gets around that iron rule in government that if you want less of something. tax it. if you want more of something. subsidize it. I dont think we want to tell the American public we want less marriage. and therefore we are taxing them. This is the time for us to accomplish this. I say in conclusion that this is going to pass. and it will pass large tomorrow morning. At least nine Democrats voted for it the last time. The only thing that stands in the way of this tax reliefthis tax sanity. that we shouldnt be taxing marriage and the American publicis the President of the United States. Please. Mr. President. sign this bill. This is good tax policy. This Congress is doing a number of. things. We are getting them to the President. It is up to the President whether he will sign them into law.

It is a grand old river. old as the continent. Its waters are pure and limpid. Its banks. from its source to its month. are dotted with great. busy cities and picturesque villages. Wealth and prosperity abound along its banks. and the possibilities for the commerce that may float upon its bosom are unbounded. This amendment proposes to transform the entire five hundred miles traversed by this river into a busy mart of commerce. The modest sum proposed to be appropriated by this amendment will. judiciously expended. simply inaugurate the grandest scheme of the nineteenth century. It will give employment to thousands of men. and the housewives and children fed by the judicious expenditure of these paltry thousand millions of dollars will have reason to rise up and call this Congress blessed.

Mr. Chairman. the banks are so far apart and the bed of the stream is so near the surface that it can not be navigated the whole distance. But at all seasons of the year there is water enough in it to float small steamboats. By the expenditure of this small sum of money ($1.000.000.000) a canal can be dug in the bed of this stream and then steamboats could start from Ostego Lake..iii Central New York. and course their way to the sea. With a portion of this money steamheaters can be erected withwhich to break the icy fetters that bind the waters for about six months of the year. and thus we shall see the tide of commerce rolling in one unceasing current. one unbroken wave (so to speak). from the icy North to the sunny South.

Mr. Chairman. the letter of the Assistant AttorneyGeneral. it seems to me. is sufficient to determine this claim. I think he says in as plain language as can be expressed that this railroad company has no claim against the Government. In view of the fact that the policy of the Department is not to enter into contracts with railroad companies. I can not anticipate how or why they should enter into a contract in this instance. and if they did. permit to say that at that time they could not have entered into a contract legally to give this railroad company any more than it was entitled to under the law. There are several of these bills before Congress. They seem to be scattered all through the committees of this House. some before the Committee on PostOffices. some before the Committee on Claims. and some maybe in other places. Here is a claim that is twentyfour years old. and which the AttorneyGeneral says in as emphatic language as can be expressed that the railroad company has no claim against the Government. and yet Congress. without a word of debate. proposes to send this case to the Court of Claims. To do what? That is the questionwhat the Court of Claims are to do about it. There is some doubt about that. I have not had an opportunity to investigate the bill. and I am free to say I think this claim should have gone where similar claims do go. From the report submitted by the committee it would seem that they had not had much opportunity. or if they have they have not availed themselves of the means at their command to investigate this case. Now. there is an allegation that there is a contract here. I should like to ask why inquiry has never been made at the proper place to ascertain whether a contract ever was executed or not? know from some experience in connection with the PostOffice Department that as to contracts coming under the Second Assistant PostmasterGeneral the greatest care has always been exercised in the filing away of contracts. And I say without fear of successful contradiction. weighing my words. that if a contract ever was entered into. that matter can not be covered up in the records of the PostOffice Department. even if there were a desire to cover it up. Not alone does the law require the filing of the contract. and. if the contract is accepted. the keeping of that contract forever. but there are other records of contracts accepted besides the contracts themselves. Now. the facts in this case evidently are as set forth by the Assistant PostmasterGeneralthat this railroad company has received every dollar to which it was entitled under the law. Of course the Committee on Claims treats this as a very trivial matter. saying that the bill proposes only to refer the case to the Court of Claims. We have heard so often. as if it were a perfectly harmless proposition. ""The bill only refers the case to the Court of Claims."" Why. sir. let me say. if you were to be here a hundred years from today. and if this case should not be determined before then. this claim will be pushed before Congress with greater vigor then than it is now. Probably the parties directly interested in this claim are dead. but their heirs will multiply as the years go by. and thus greater vigor will be given to the claim. Now. when the PostOffice Department says emphatically that this railroad company must have received all that it is entitled to under the law. why endeavor to keep in existence and perpetuate the claim? My God! is it impossible to suppress a clgim before Congress? You can not suppress it even when you pay itl Only a few Congresses subsequently. a claim comes up for something additional.

I believe the President should. in appointing members of the Interstate Commerce Commission. recognize the problems of transportation and the capacity of the men who are to be appointed commissioners to deal with those problems. and I think he has done so. in the main. The reason why there should be a man from the South on the Interstate Commerce Commission is that the southeastern territory of the United Statesthe Atlantic coast and the States which border upon It south of the Potomac Riverhave a peculiar problem in transportation. which may be said of nearly every other territory in the United States. and in so far as it is possible for the President to adjust his nominations. regard ought to be paid to the fact that the inhabitants of a particular geographical part of the United States may be supposed to have greater information on transportation problems in his section than some one from another part of our country. But I could not find it possible for me to support a bill which would attempt to limit or direct the President of the United States. when nominating commissioners. to select men froni any particular part of the country. If we can not have enough confidence in the Chief Executive of the United States to believe he will give due consideration to these matters. in my judgment. it would be impossible to cure the trouble by legislation. I am not interested in that particular matter. but I did not want the Senate to be left under the impression that there was any connection between the five districts into which the Interstate Commerce Commission divided the country for rate making and the proposal for the consolidation of the railroads. There is no connection whatever. and. while I agree that it would be very wise to select a man from the South or Southeastern States for the Interstate Commerce Commission.

I rise in support of the Mitchell inventory reform package amendment which simplifies the rules for converting to the last in. first out. or LIFO. accounting method and allows small businesses to use cash accounting. Mr. President. this amendment will benefit the many small businesses of this country that are inventory. as opposed to capital. intensive in nature. This includes the thousands of small wholesalers. retailers and manufacturers that contribute so much to our economy. I want to congratulate the Senator from Maine for the fine effort he has made on this amendment. and. indeed. for his devoted work on small business issues in general. His efforts in the Finance Committee. particularly with regard to proposing a small business direct expensing amendment which the committee has included in the tax bill. are especially appreciated by this Senator who also has concerns about the plight of small business in the United States today. I would also like to commend the National Federation of Independent Business for its diligent efforts on behalf of this amendment. NFIB has done a great service to its small business constituency through its strong support of this inventory reform package. Mr. President. this amendment would greatly simplify the rules with regard to the conversion from first in first out. or FIFO. accounting to the IUFO method. Though FIFO is the more commonly used accounting method. inflation causes it to understate the cost of goods sold by a business and therefore overstate a business taxable income. This also overstates the tax liability of the firm in question. In 1979 alone. inadequate inventory accounting added $42.6 billion to taxable profits. This overtaxation could be avoided through the use of LIFO accounting if small businesses could only convert to it without incurring great conversion costs. But the LIFO rules are extremely complicated. Despite the obvious benefits from the use of LIFO. only small percentages of those businesses who could make use of this tool do so. Of all corporations in 1976. only 2.5 percent of wholesalers. 1.3 percent of retailers and 3.7 percent of manufacturers used LIFO accounting. The present rules are simply too complicated for a small firm to handle without extensive assistance from outside accounting firms. Mr. President. this amendment also provides for a study of the small business use cash accounting. This system recognizes income and expenses when they actually occur. much as we do in our personal checking accounts. Income tax is then paid only on income actually received and not on inflation bloated inventories. Under present law. only certain farm operations are allowed to use cash accounting. Mr. President. I commend this amendment to my colleagues who are interested in the plight of small business sector of our economy. It is the small business that produces most of the new jobs in this country. It is the small business that does that most efficient job of coming up with more productive ways of doing things in this economy. Yet small business is beset with a long list of problems. most of which are not encountered by their larger competitors. We must take a firm step in the direction of equitable treatment for small firms.

I rise to introduce legislation I intended to offer as an amendment to the immigration bill. Unfortunately. it does not appear I will have the opportunity to offer this as an amendment to that bill. I therefore decided to offer this as a freestanding bill as I believe it is an issue that needs to be addressed whether or not we decide to go back to this bill. Much of the debate on the immigration legislation involves complex issues and arcane areas of the law. My legislation is pretty easy to understand. It is a common sense legislative solution to a simple. but troubling. issue. The issue my bill attempts to resolve is that of international parental abductions. Significantly. my bill does not attempt to right a wrong. Rather. it attempts to prevent future wrongs from occurring. And there is little dispute that absent legislation. future wrongs will occur. The wrong that occurs is best illustrated by a living nightmare forced upon an American family from Henderson. NV. No parent should ever have to go through what Fred and Barbara Spierer went through in 1993. That year. on Valentines Day. Barbara Spierers exhusband took her son to his native country. wartorn Croatia. She would soon learn that upon their arrival. her exhusband initiated official custody proceedings in a Croatian court. Through tremendous emotional and financial costs. Fred and Barbara Spierer were able to secure the return of young Mikey. Incredibly. this could all have been prevented if our laws didnt permit such easy procurement of passports for minors. Few would disagree that parental consent should be given before a passport is issued to a minor child. Both parents ought to be notified before the State Department issues a document permitting their child to be taken out of this country. Presently. such joint notification is not required. Under current law. one parent can apply for a U.S. passport for his or her child. receive it. and then depart from the country with that child. Again. this can all be accomplished without the notification of the other parent. Current law is an invitation to engage in the grossest of misbehavior by a scurrilous parent. And engage in it they do. Sadly. the case of Fred and Barbara Spierer is not an isolated incident. International parental abductions are a growing problem. In 1994. there were over 600 cases of children being abducted from the U.S.A. Thousands of parents are attempting to bring home their children who were taken from this country by a mother or father. While these cases are tracked by the State Department. childrens advocates believe many more go unreported. Often. the children are snatched during a divorce. The abducting parents usually have strong ties to a foreign country. But sometimes an Americanborn mother or father will take off for an unfamiliar nation to flee U.S. law. Regrettably. such surreptitious travel is made quite easy because of current law. Why? Because one parent can procure the childs passport without the other one knowing. Leftbehind parents are faced with wading through a maze of foreign laws and customs in their efforts to secure their childs return. Imagine how difficult it is to find a missing child in the United States and then multiply it by 1.000. Thats about how difficult it is to locate and return a child abducted overseas. And finding a missing child is only the start. A parent must then take their case to the foreign countrys legal system. Most: nations do not recognize custody orders from U.S. courts. Even when criminal charges have been filed against the abducting parent in the United States. many nations will not honor a U.S. request for extradition. Some countries simply discriminate against women. The decision to fight for a childs return consumes enormous amounts of time and money. Many parents are simply without the financial wherewithal to engage in a protracted international legal battle. For a variety of reasons. the Government is able to do very little to assist these parents. The current budgetary constraints realistically preclude doing more to secure the return of abducted children. But they do not preclude efforts to implement additional barriers to prevent these tragic abductions from occurring. My bill takes cost effective steps toward preventing future abductions. It implements a system of checks prior to the issuance of a minor childs passport. Both parents would be required to sign the passport application of a child under the age of 16. Or. if the parents were already divorced. the application would have to be signed by the parent of the child having primary custody. If such a law had been in place by 1993. Barbara Spierers exhusband would not have been able to abduct their child to Croatia. The passport would not have been issued because her written permission had not been given. I believe it is drafted in such a manner. so as to give the State Department the April 18. 19 discretion to implement a reasonable and flexible rule. This bill is not just about parental rights and preventing these tragic international abductions. It is also about protecting the rights of our children. No one disagrees that the rights. liberties and freedoms provided in our Nation make it the best country in the world. No child should be forced to lose these rights. No child should be forced to undergo what Mikey. Kale lived through. No American child. regardless of his age. should be abducted to the middle of a war torn part of the world. American parents should not be forced to endure the living nightmare that the Spierers were forced to go through. If my bill prevents only one family from having to endure this nightmare it will be judged a success. I believe that more can be done but this is the most cost effective step we can take today. I encourage my colleagues to cosponsor this legislation and support it should we return to fonsideration of the immigration bill. Mr. President.

I rise in strong support of the Andrews amendment. part of the en bloc. and thank my colleague from New Jersey for offering it. In February of this year. Iintroduced a bill. H. Con. Res. 36. that is very similar to my colleagues amendment. Like the amendment. it expresses the Sense of the Congress that the islets of Imia in the Aegean Sea are sovereign Greek territory under international law. As those who are familiar with this issue know. for some three and a half years now Turkey has stood firm in its totally groundless claim that it has sovereignty over the Greek islets of Imia. On December 25. 1995 a Turkish bulk carrier ran ashore on the islets of Imia. one of two uninhabited islets which are part of the Dodecanese islands group in the Aegean Sea. This incident nearly escalated into armed conflict between NATO allies Turkey and Greece due to Turkeys belligerent claim that the islets. which are sovereign Greek territory. belonged to Turkey. Hostilities were avoided after the Greek government refused to attack a detachment of Turkish commandos who had been dispatched to the islets and President Clinton personally intervened to help defuse the crisis. Despite Turkeys continued insistence that the islets are Turkish territories. the historical record on this issue is clear. As this amendment. as well as my bill details. the Dodecanese.islands group was ceded by Turkey to Italy in the Lausanne Treaty of 1923. The boundaries delineating the exact sovereignty between Turkey and the islands group were finalized in a December 1932 protocol between Turkey and Italy. That protocol. which was annexed to the Convention Between Italy and Turkey .for the Delimitation of Anatolia and the Island of Castellorizio. placed the islets of Imia under the sovereignty of Italy. In the 1947 Paris Treaty of Peace with Italy. Italy ceded the Dodecanese islands groups to Greece. The legal status of the Dodecanese islands group remained unchallenged by Turkey until its bulk carrier ran aground in late 1995 and Ankara began making its unfounded claims in 1996. That same year. the European Parliament approved a resolution reaffirming the historical record. The 1996 resolution stated that the water boundaries established in the Treaty of Lausanne of 1923 and the 1932 protocol to the convention between Italy and Turkey. are the borders between Greece and Turkey. Despite all of these readily available and irrefutable facts. Turkey continues to promote instability in the region by ignoring the historical record with its claim of sovereignty over the islets of Imia. Mr. Chairman. Turkeys unfounded claim should not go unnoticed by Congress. The United States Congress should follow the precedent of the European Parliament and reaffirm the historical record in a show of support for territory that is unquestionably sovereign to Greece and for the rule of international law in general. The United States should also pressure Turkey to resolve this issue. and all other outstanding territorial disputes with Greecethe most notable of which is the nearly 25 year old invasion of Cyprusin a peaceful fashion. To that end. in addition to reaffirming Greeces sovereignty over the islets of Imia. both my bill and the Andrews amendment include language urging Turkey to agree to bring the dispute in the Aegean over Imia to the International Court of Justice at the Hague for a resolution.

For several weeks past we were aware that Penn Central executives were spending a good deal of time in Washington attempting to obtain some unspecified kind of financial assistance. Then we learned that a $100 million bond issue at 10.5 percent was aborted for lack of takers. Suddenly a special meeting of the companys board of directors deposed most of the leadership of the Penn Central. The very next day the Nixon administration sent its emissaries to Congress to inform us that it intended to provide loan guarantees under. of all things. the Defense Production Act. The plan. we were told. was for $200 million to be provided in that fashion. but the plight of this $7 billion corporation is such that another $400 to $500 million in loans would have to be underwritten by the Federal Government before the railroad would be completely out of trouble. No indication was given as to what the administration thought the Government should require in return. help would come with few questions asked. The administration has now wisely backed away from this scheme to provide immediate. nostringsattached assistance under the Defense Production Act. But Congress will still apparently be asked to cast aside the basic principles of the free enterprise system in order to pass a special relief bill for a railroad turned conglomerate. We are led to believe that transportation services are of prime concern in this grossly irregular procedure. But when we had a chance to look at the bill it quickly became clear that it was designed not for the purpose of preserving or improving the transportation services of this organization but rather for the purpose of shoring up the banks to which the Penn Central is in debt in the amount of some $2 billion. Moreover. we have only the sketchiest idea of who. precisely. we will be helping if we approve such a measure. Federal records at the Interstate Commerce Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission raise more questions than they answer: most of the Penn Central creditors and all of its stockholders are anonymous. At a minimum. Congress has the duty to find out who stands to benefit from Government largesse before we hand out millions of dollars of the taxpayers money. There are also some basic policy issues at stake. We need to know. for example. whether the Penn Centrals railroad businessimportant for the national defensehas brought it to these difficult financial straits. or whether instead its problems have been caused by its practice of diverting assets and management time into investment adventures unrelated to rail service. In this connection. it is common knowledge that passenger and freight service alike have deteriorated since the merger of the New York Central and the Pennsylvania Railroad. Just recently the traffic manager of the B. F. Goodrich Co. was quoted in Newsweek as saying: If I can avoid using the Penn Central under any circumstances. I am going to do it. And the complaints of Penn Central passengers are legion. Yet during the time since the merger. the Penn Central has pursued real estate schemes in Florida. Texas. and Georgia. and has started milliondollar renovation projects in Manhattan hotels. If the U.S. Government intends to bail out a failing company. it must demand at the very least that this company is indeed serving the public interest. We are not an openhanded guarantor of private corporate investment schemes. We have a duty to find out what the priorities are at the Penn Centralwhether it is feeding its transportation business or bleeding it--before we subscribe a penny of public money to the venture. Mr. President. I have barely touched on only a few of the salient issues which confront us as the bankruptcy proceedings go forward and the administration readies a relief bill. It is vitally important that the Congress look into all these questions in an orderly and thorough way. beginning with the negotiations that led to the merger of the New York Central and the Pennsylvania. and following through to the immediate causes of the Penn Centrals present financial disarray. Without such an inquiry we will be unable to act as responsibly as the public interest demands. Accordingly. I have today directed the staff of the Subcommittee on Surface Transportation to begin preparations for conducting a fullscale review of these matters. It is my hope that we will be able to proceed expeditiously to develop the kind of information and understanding that will enable the Congress to meet its responsibilities to the transportation industry. to the financial community. and above all to the American people whose interests will be so vitally affected by the decisions we must inevitably make.\n',action yesterdaya file petition bankruptcy climax series bizarre event demand congressional scrutiny several week aware executive spend good deal time attempt obtain unspecified kind financial assistance learn bond issue percent abort lack taker special meeting board_director depose most leadership next day administration send emissary inform intend provide loan guarantee thing plan tell provide fashion plight corporation such loan underwrite railroad trouble indication give administration think require return help come few question ask administration back scheme provide immediate nostringsattache assistance ask cast basic principle free_enterprise system order pass special relief bill railroad turn conglomerate lead believe transportation service prime concern irregular procedure chance look bill become clear design purpose preserve improve transportation service organization purpose shore bank debt amount sketchy idea help approve measure federal record raise more question answer most central creditor stockholder anonymous minimum duty find stand benefit largesse hand million_dollar taxpayer money basic policy issue stake need know example railroad businessimportant national bring difficult financial_strait problem cause practice divert asset management time investment adventure unrelated rail service connection common knowledge passenger_freight service deteriorate merger traffic manager quote say avoid use circumstance go complaint passenger legion time merger pursue real_estate scheme start milliondollar renovation project hotel intend bail fail company demand least company serve public interest openhande guarantor private corporate investment scheme duty find priority feed transportation business bleed subscribe penny public money venture touch few salient issue confront bankruptcy proceeding go administration ready relief bill important look question orderly thorough way begin negotiation lead merger follow immediate cause present financial disarray inquiry unable act public interest demand today direct staff begin preparation conduct fullscale review matter hope able proceed develop kind information understanding enable meet responsibility transportation industry financial community american people interest affect decision make.\n,91.0,bound,0,1

I appreciate the gentleman yielding me this time. I urge support for this legislation. Let me say first. Mr. Chairman. that 55 years ago there was a boat named the St. Louis off the shores of Cuba. ironically. There were hundreds of people on that boat. They asked for the same thing that these people are asking for today. not a handout. not a screen card. not citizenship. just a place to stay while the trouble in their homeland subsided. They were sent home. many to their deaths. and America should not repeat that sad story. The bill that has been crafted by the distinguished subcommittee chairman is a very narrow bill. It does not apply to anyone who flees from Haiti to Cuba after a date that is in the past already. It does not allow those who have been there any rights in the United States.

I rise in strong opposition to subtitles B and C of title 5 of the Budget Reconciliation Actthe Interior Committee title. Subtitle A meets all of the Interior Committees budget savings Instructions by requiring 100 percent recovery of NRC costs from users of their services. That means that subtitles B and C are extra credit for the committee. Im not against extra credit work. so long as it is intellectually honest. These provisions are not. Subtitle C changes the rules for patent of oil shale claims in Western States. It is unfair and the willingness of claimants to patent or maintain claims at these increased levels of $2.000 and $5.000 is highly questionable. Oil shale is currently uneconomic. It makes no sense to make maintaining those claims even more costly. when they are currently unprofitable. It just drives up costs and puts off the day when oil shale will become a contributor to our national energy supply system. We will not receive additional money from these projects. and therefore any savings are just smoke and mirrors. The worst part of this package is subtitle B. dealing with the Tongass National Forest in Alaska. This is nothing more than a land grab hiding behind a budget savings disputed by our own Congressional Budget Office. The only true budget item is the repeal of an automatic $40 million fund from nationwide forest receipts which go for road building. fish and wildlife improvement. and similar projects which increase Forest Service access and enjoyment for the general public. I support this because it would simply put the Tongass in the appropriations process like every other National forest. It is the only true savings in the package. But the Interior title also takes on two items which have passed the House but have nothing to do with budget savings. First. the title would break two longterm legal contracts. The CBO estimates that breaking these contracts will cost the Federal Government between $20 and $250 million or more. The Constitution of this country holds contracts to be private property of the parties. If one side breaks its part of the deal. it is liable for damages. You simply cant break Federal contracts without paying damages. The taxpayers will end up paying through the nose on this one if it ever becomes law. and the authors know it. Any estimate which denies the basic principles of contract law is not worth the paper it is written on. Finally. the Interior title adds 1.8 million acres of wilderness on the Tongass. which already has more wilderness than most States. Many of these areas were not reviewed by the committee for possible conflicts with native corporations. communities. or State transportation and utility development plans. Since passage on the floor. I have received word from the State of Alaska Department of Transportation detailing the massive disruption of transportation plans for the region caused by wilderness designationsomething we did not know when considering the Tongass legislation. Further. Gvldbelt. Inc.. southeast Alaskas largest Native village corporation. has comue out strongly against the legislation. Los it would surround their lands with wilderness. gutting the economic viabiity of the lands for 2.700 Alaska Natives. This. too. was not considered by the committee. Other impacts of trese designations are being discovered weekly as communities or groups find out just what could be done to them by the Tongass legislation. The community of Craig. AK. reversed its support for the legislation when it discovered that 65 percent of its population was directly affected by the timber industry. Others are reviewing their positions. Including almost 2 million acres of wilderness in a budget bill is a gross violation of the budget bill. We might as well sell off a park or two to raise cashIm sure the Japanese would line up to support such a socalled budget item. This is a blatant violation of the budget process and the agreements with the President on reconciliation. I have been here 16 years and I plan to be here for many more. If this goes forward. it has implications not only for Alaska. but other States as well. Members would do well to remember that fact. I am a member of three committees. On two of these. we have bipartisan cooperation and work for consensus. Respect and cooperation are the ruling principles. This results in many bills being signed into law. Many of the same issues are dealt with in the Interior Committee. but without cooperation. no new laws result. Tongass is an examplewe nearly reached an agreement last year. If we would have carried that bill forward. there would be a new law on the Tongass and we would not have to carry on this budget ruse. I recognize the position of the House. and must therefore continue my constructive dialog with the administration. I am informed that the Tongass section is one which would lead to a veto. If the Congress is not responsibleif we dont seek to rein in some of our more flamboyant and irresponsible proposals. laws will continue to be made by the other body and the administration. and we will continue to be considered ""wackoes"" by many in the governmental process.

Today this House is being given the opportunity to vote on the Mansfield amendment that would end our military involvement in Indochina 9 months after enactment of this bill. The only condition for our withdrawal is the release of U.S. prisoners of war being held in Indochina. The issue of the prisoners is the only issue that can be used to legitimately justfiy our continued military presence in Southeast Asia. but I have the most serious doubts that our continued fighting will make the release of prisoners any more certain. As has been discussed. the exchange of prisoners has traditionally been accomplished after the cessation of hostilities. Still. the Mansfield amendment which has passed the Senate by a vote of 57 to 42 should be adopted by the House of Representatives. I prefer that the date to end the war be earlierI have supported the December 31. 1971 deadlinebut I feel that the Mansfield amendment offers the Congress an historic chance to reaffirm its constitutional role in decisions affecting peace and war.

They insisted these despicable procedures were only performed in extreme medical circumstances. Therefore. they said the Federal Govern- ent should not pass laws to stop it. but that was a flat out lie. I do not use that word often. but I will repeat it. It was not just an error. It was a lie. These claims were either manufactured or disseminated in an attempt to minimize the significance of the Issue and to dismiss the issues raised by Senator SMIT1I. In my view. it was based on an ends justify the means theory. As reported in a 1997 frontpage article in the Washington Times. Mr. Ron Fitzslmmons. the executive director of the National Coalition of Abortion Providerslet me say that again. the executive director of the National Coalition of Abortion Providers. who had been traveling the country saying these procedures were rare. had a change of heart.

Was it illegitimate when Dr. Martin Luther King marched for freedom based on his belief in the Scriptures? Religious principle is not an illegitimate reason for a motivation. but that has been a complaint about those who question the procedure.

Participants. in consultation with volunteer adult advisors. set and achieve their own goals in four areas: Volunteer community service. personal development. physical fitness. and expeditions. Upon fulfilling their goals. participants receive recognition for their efforts from the U.S. Congress through the presentation of a congressional award. Participation in the congressional award program creates in young people from whatever background. qualities of confidence in themselves. selfinitiative and the desire and knowledge to become active. responsible members of society.

Individualized. noncompetitive effort is encouragedyoung people are not selected for the award. they earn it. The problems of alcoholism. drugs. and unemployment are positively combated. Contact with Members of Congress involves young people more fully in their Government. The quality of life within communities is enhanced through the efforts of these young people. Since 1982. when the first medals were presented. more than 5.000 young people have received awards. Calculated conservatively. program requirements for voluntary community service alone have returned more than 750.000 hours to local needs.

I rise to speak against amendment No. 1059 which would attempt to change foreign policy toward Cuba in an appropriations bill. which I think procedurally. as well as substantively. is the wrong thing to do. I urge my fellow Senators to vote ""no"" on this amendment. The amendment would seek to unconditionally grant a concession to the repressive Castro regime. This is a government- and a country that currently suppresses the human rightp of its people. It has been on the list of states that assist terrorism. consistently right there with North Korea and other countries that are not particularly helpful to our global war on terror. Aside from that. this policy of travel consists as one leg or one part of a more comprehensive travel policy toward Cuba that the United States put in place under the leadership of our President about a year and a half ago. It created some restrictions on travel. It limited travel even among Cuban families. I know this community well. I know it is.a policy that is largely supported by that community. I also would tell you that there is. in my own life. the knowledge that the denial of family reunification is something that for over 40 years the Cuban system has utilized as part of their endeavor in order to control people. I had lived in this country for 4 years. and during those 4 years of separation from my mother and fatherbetween the ages of 15 and 19my family was not able to travel here to visit me. They were not allowed by the Cuban Government to at any point leave Cuba to visit. The case of this brave soldier. whom I greatly respect and honor. Mr. Lazo. who has served his country bravely in Iraq. has been brought up. Let me say. specifically. on that case. this young man. who has sons in Cuba. wishes to go to Cuba to visit his sons. It is understandable. He has been there in the past 3 years. He wants to go again. His sons are 16 and 19. We have asked Mr. Lazo if he would allow us to bring his children here so they could visit here. One of them has had some illness. Currently. he is not under medical care. but he has been recently. He could certainly seek medical care here when he came. under his fathers auspices. In addition to that. I believe it would be a nice thing for these children to have an opportunity to visit in a free sobiety and a free country. That request. that offer. has been refused. For family reasons or other reasons. he doesnt care to pursue that. He wants to go there. I understand that. But I dont believe we can change the foreign policy of the United States to suit one individual situation. I am sympathetic to family travel. I am sympathetic to humanitarian problems that may arise from time to time in peoples families. I have lived those in my own family and my own life. However. I believe the policy of the United StRtes. the law of the United States. ought to be followed and that it would be wrong for us in this instance at this time to change what is established foreign policy of our country. established in terms of our relationship with Cuba. simply to take care of this individual situation.

I spoke on this subject in the last session of Congress at some length. I have no desire in any sense whatever to make a speech now. but I have some additional facts bearing on the matter which I desire to present. believing that possibly they may be of use in the further progress of this debate. In discussing the question of reciprocity with Canada in the last session of Congress I tried to show that no harm would come to this country if the terms of the agreement were enacted into law. and that it would be in full accord with the practice of the Republican Party in the past and also with the provisions of the national Republican platform at the present time. I pointed outFirst. That in every case where we had made reciprocity agreements with other countries the result had been beneficial to both parties. Second. That the pending agreement was in no sense a general tariff revision. but simply a straightforward business arrangement with a single adjacent country for the reciprocal exchange of such articles as the negotiators of both Governments believed. after most careful consideration. could be made with safety to each other and for the mutual advantage of both. and that the special rates so made had no necessary bearing upon the general tariff relations of either Canada or the United States with the other countries of the world. and Third. That the racial characteristics of the respective peoples and the climatic conditions of the two countries fully justified an entirely different course of action of one toward the other from that which ought to control our relations with the peoples on the other side of the two oceans. where like conditions do not prevail. I laid down the fundamental principle that competition can not exist between the products of two nations except with reference to their exportable surplus. and showed the statistical position of the principal crops of Canada and the United States In this respect. I think I demonstrated beyond dispute. for no reply has yet been made by anybody to the proposition. that the higher cost of living which now obtains in this country was due to an enormously increased demand for food products and a proportionately decreased productive power on our part. and that this great change. due largely to immigration and a transition from agriculture to manufacturing. had begun on the Atlantic coast and was steadily moving westward until now its influence was effective and controlling in the central West. I pointed out. also. that the transference of millions upon millions of the foodproducing classes from the nations of Europe into the manufacturing industries of this country had made the tendency to a higher cost of living worldwide. and I expressed my sincere belief that the continuation of high prices for food products was inevitable. and that the only possible effect of complete freedom of exchange of all natural products between the United States and Canada would be to temporarily retard the rapid advances and to steady the fluctuations of the prices of the fastdiminishing export surplus of many of the food products of both countries. and that a considerable period of time would be necessary for a permanent readjustment of the present worldwide conditions of the cost of living. I showed that the land values differed in the different Provinces of Canada as they did In the United States. but that taking all occupied farm lands in the Dominion. the average value was $38.60 per acre. as against a value of $23.38 of all occupied farm lands in the United States.\n',gentleman speak subject last session length desire sense make speech additional fact bear matter desire present believe use further progress debate discuss question reciprocity last session try show harm come country term agreement enact law full accord practice past provision national republican platform present time point case make reciprocity agreement other country result beneficial party pende agreement sense general tariff revision straightforward business arrangement single adjacent country reciprocal exchange such article negotiator government believe careful consideration make safety other mutual advantage special rate make necessary bearing general tariff relation other country world racial characteristic respective people climatic_condition country justify different course action other control relation people other side ocean condition prevail lay fundamental principle competition exist product nation reference exportable_surplus show statistical position principal crop respect think demonstrate dispute reply make proposition high cost living obtain country due increase demand food product decrease productive power part great change due immigration transition agriculture manufacturing begin atlantic_coast move influence effective control central point transference million million foodproducing class nation manufacturing industry country make tendency high cost live express sincere belief continuation high price food product inevitable only possible effect complete freedom exchange natural product retard rapid advance steady fluctuation price fastdiminishe_export surplus many food product country considerable period time necessary permanent readjustment present worldwide condition cost living show land value differ different take occupy farm land average value acre value occupy farm land,62.0,bound,1,0

I rise in support of S. 440. the war powers bill. of which I am a cosponsor. No legislation. in my judgment. is more essential than is this bill in the efforts of the Congress of the United States to restore a proper balance between the executive and legislative branches of government. The significance of this bill. however. goes beyond that immediate and desirable objective. It is important to all citizens as well. inasmuch as the life of every citizen of this Republic can be affected by the farreaching decisions which may be made with respect to the questions of war and peace. This bill plows no new ground. It seeks instead. to reaffirm and to reestablish the original Intent of the framers of the Constitution. Its aim. in the simplest terms. is to set forth guidelines for the use of the Armed Forces of the United States in socalled ""undeclared wars."" so that in the future the best judgment of both the Congress and the Chief Executive may jointly be brought to bear upon the problem at hand. Not only the events of recent years. but also the use of U.S. forces in undeclared hostilities by Presidents in years past. make this legislation necessary. Passage of this bill is especially important at this point in our history when the United States is moving toward a reassessment of its responsibilities and its future role as a world power. The approval of this bill is needed so that in the future there may be no mistake and no misunderstanding about the circumstances in which our Armed Forces may be used without a declaration of war by the Congress. The authority of the President of the United States to act appropriately in an emergency is not impaired by this bill. Section 3 of this measure spells out in detail the conditions or circumstances under which the President. as Commander in Chief. can act to repel or forestall sudden attacks. or to protect U.S. citizens whose lives might be endangered abroad. Subsections (1). (2). and (3) codify the implied power of the President to act in emergency situations. Subsection (4) of section 3 deals with the delegation by Congress of additional authority to the President through statutory action and establishes a means by which the President and the Congress. working together. could act to deal with any contingency which might arise. It is this provision of the bill which would be brought into play in any future situation such as that from which we are only now extricating ourselves in Indochina. The language here would require that the Congress participate with the President in any decision to authorize use of the Armed Forces in any situation other than the three emergency categories of sudden attack upon the United States. attack upon its Armed Forces. or the protection of its nationals abroad. Section 5 of the bill provides the 30day limitation upon emergency action by the President. and seems to me to be as satisfactory a solution as may be devised to the problem of reconciling the necessity for swift retaliatory action in the event of attack with the constitutional requirement that Congress make the ultimate judgment upon the question of waging war. It is not my purpose in these brief remarks to go into more detailed aspects of S. 440. Suffice it to say. I think. that this is a bill whose time has come. Presidential warmaking must be brought under control. The Congress must reassert itself in this vital area in which the Constitution makes it so unmistakably clear that the legislative branch bears the ultimate responsibility. The disclosures this week of the hundreds of secret U.S. bombing raids carried out over Cambodia and Laosand the falsification of reports concerning themsharply underscores the necessity for action. If war is too important a matter to be left to the generals. it is also too important a matter to be left to the Commander in Chief alone. This is not to suggest that the Congress is infallible in its wisdom. But in times when national commitments may require action. or in times of national peril. the collective best judgment of the Nations elected leaderslegislative and executive togetheris the Nations one best hope of following the right course of action.\n'",rise support war power bill cosponsor legislation judgment essential bill effort restore proper balance executive legislative_branch government significance bill go immediate desirable objective important citizen inasmuch life citizen affect farreache decision make respect question war peace bill plow new ground seek reaffirm reestablish original intent framer aim simple term set guideline use socalled undeclared_war future good judgment bring bear problem hand event recent year use force undeclared hostility president year past make legislation necessary passage bill important point history move reassessment responsibility future role world power approval bill need future mistake misunderstanding circumstance use declaration war authority act emergency impair bill section measure spell detail condition circumstance act repel forestall sudden attack protect citizen life endanger subsection codify imply power act emergency situation subsection section deal delegation additional authority statutory action establish mean work act deal contingency arise provision bill bring play future situation such extricate language require participate decision authorize use situation other emergency category sudden attack attack protection national section bill provide limitation emergency action seem satisfactory solution devise problem reconcile necessity swift retaliatory action event attack constitutional requirement make ultimate judgment question wage war purpose brief remark go detailed aspect suffice say think bill time come presidential_warmaking bring control reassert vital area make clear legislative_branch bear ultimate responsibility disclosure week hundred secret bombing_raid carry falsification report concern themsharply underscore necessity action war important matter leave general important matter leave suggest infallible wisdom time national commitment require action time national peril collective good judgment elect leaderslegislative executive togetheris good hope follow right course,93.0,bound,0,1

Senator JOHN MCCLELLAN died in his sleep Monday night. He had been seriously ill in recent months. but his influence on all of usmost notably in the codification of Federal criminal lawwas as strong and as vigorous as ever. His qualities of mind and character which gave special distinction to his many years of service to the American people are all too rare. Our Nationindeed. any nationcan illafford the loss of a statesman of his caliber. His leadership. his unflinching devotion to the public good. and his unstinting hard work have been an inspiration to every Member of this Congress. Those of us who were privileged to know him as a colleague and a friend mourn not only the passing of a statesman. but the passing of a genuinely decent and fairminded man. As a freshman Senator. I had the good fortune to serve on two committees with JOHN MCCLELLAN. I thus had an extraordinary opportunity to learn firsthand what effective legislative leadership demands. His performance as chairman of the Appropriations Committee and ranking member of the Judiciary and Governmental Affairs Committees set a standard of excellence and dedication that few will ever equal. He was always generous with advice and counsel. especially to a newer Member. and ready to lend a helping hand. The people of Arizona owe Senator MCCLELLAN a special debt. His years of friendship with former Senators Hayden and McFarland enabled our State to receive the Federal assistance that has been so vital to our economic development. particularly in the area of water resource development. Senator MCCLELLAN extended the same hand of friendship to me. and continued his efforts on behalf of Arizonans to the very end.

However. the funding level designated for the potato cyst nematode in this bill falls short of the necessary funding levels to continue this eradication effort.

Mr. President. when one is tat as rustee for another party and coninually and continuousiy operates in the interest of the creditor of his ward. as it maybe if he happens to be a guardianif he coniues in every transaction to take the side of the creditor. and thereby ignore the rights of the person whom he r is not a cour in all the land ut what would remove him from office. and he would go out disgraced foreveMr. Will you tell me how it is a violation of the law when the Secretary of the Treasury openly refuses to tender silver in the payment of these bonds. and then appears bcefore a committee of the other House and says that the standard silver dollars are redeemable in gold? The Senator from Iowa [MRr. APresiN said this evening that the passage of this resolution would tend to disturb the business of the country and retard is prosperity. The Senator from Iowa and those who act with him on the other side of the Chamber have made so many false prophecies in the past that their predictions have ceased to excite either hope or fear in the bosom of any man who listens to him or to them. If there is any one thing remarkable for its uniformity and its regularity. it is how the prodictions of the Senators opposed to silver have not comn to pass. There is scarcely a man in this Chamber opposed to silver who was here in 1893 who has not changed his position on this question. In 1893 every Senator on this floor spoke upon the question of the unconditional repeal of the Sherman law. Everyman who ""was here on both sides of the Chamber spoke. andwith one exception. and that is the Senator from Louisiana [r. CFFERY] every man here declared he was opposed to the singlegold standard and im favor of bimetallism. You can not find a speech made by a Senator on this floor. except the Senator from Louisiana. wherein the Senator did not declare .himself in favor of bimetallism and of both gold and silver as standard money and money of final redemption. Yet today those same Senators we find standing and upholding the Secretary of he Treasury an the President of the United States. when they say that theypropose more effectually to fasten the gold standard upon the people of this country. Mr. President. going back to the predictions to which Ireferred. they told us in 1893 that if we passed the unconditional repeal bill prosperity would burst and bloom forth in this country as it never had done. The act was unconditionally repealed. and a period of distress and business depression set in which has never been equaled in the United States of America. They told us that if we passed that bill we should have legislation in favor of silver. Yet. in the very next session of Congress. when we passed the seigniorage bill. the President of the United States vetoed it. and he was sustained by the Republican members of the Senate in that veto. They told us in addition that if we passed the unconditional repeal bill it would insure international 13imetallism. They said. and the Senator from Iowa said it. too. that there was nothing that would tend to make foreign nations come into an agreement so quickly as unconditional repeal. and that they had no doubt that if the bill were passed that condition of things would be brought about. Yet today. with the exception of my friend the Senator from Colorado . and possibly the Senator from Nqew Hampshire . there is not a man on the other side of the Chamber who believes in the gold standard who has the faintest hope that international binetallism will ever come. N~ot only that. but they told us that if .we passed the bill there would be no danger of a bond issue. ""If you do not pass it."" they said. ""we will have to sell gold bonds."" They did pass it. We did not do it.but theydid. andinmediatelyfollowing thepassage of it came the sales of bonds. some of them in a way that reflected no credit upon the men who engineered the transaction. Furthermore. when some of us insisted here thatif yhrepealed the act and made no conditions the next cry would be in favor of retiring the greenbacks of the count. they said no man and no party would dare to stand before the American people and advocate the retirement of the greenbacks. I remember distinctly that when I was speaking upon the floor and said that the time might come w they would first retire the greenbacks and sell bonds and then the bondholders and the money changers in the East would put forward the absurd proposition that a silver dollar itself was redeemable in gold. the Senator from New Jersey. not now here. said no man not an idiotwould ever contend in the United States of America that standard silver dollars were redeemable in gold. Yet today we have the Secretary of the Treasury taking the broad ground that every silver dollar must be redeemed in gold. and while the President seeks in a way tohold fast possibly a few Senators like some on the other side of the Chamber. yet he has not the nerve to kick out that Secretary of the Treasury. and the conclusion is that he indorses the views expressed by him. That is the condition. and when the Senator from Iowa deals in prophecies and predictions. I tell him that I do not believe him. I tell him that he has been predioting for twentyfive years and no prediction that he has ever made within my knowledge has come to pass. 1 prefer to take the prophecy of others. You say. ""Oh. but what is the use of bringing this resolution in here? Why do you want to pass it?"" I will tell the Senator another reason why I want to pass it. I want to serve notice on the Secretary of the Treasury and the President of the United States that any attempt to more firmly fasten the gold standard upon the peopleof thiscountry will be resisted and fought at every step. I want to tell them that the 6.000.000 people who voted for the Democratic candidate in 1806 are more firmly of the determination today to see that the wrongs that have beenheaped upon the people shall be righted. I want to tell the bondholders that the issue of 1806 will he the issue of 1900. and that every man who loves his country. every man who despises injustice. whatever may be his affiliations in the past. as I hope and believe. will rally around that standard. and neither bribery nor intmidation can again beat down the will of the majority of the people of the United States.\n'",tat rustee party continuousiy operate interest creditor ward happen guardianif coniue transaction take side creditor ignore right person r cour land remove office go disgrace tell violation law refuse tender silver payment bond appear committee other say standard silver dollar redeemable_gold mrr say evening passage resolution tend disturb business country retard prosperity act other side make many false prophecy past prediction cease excite hope fear bosom man listen thing remarkable uniformity regularity prodiction oppose silver comn pass man oppose silver change position question floor speak question unconditional_repeal law side speak exception man declare oppose_singlegold standard m favor bimetallism find speech make floor declare favor bimetallism gold_silver standard money money final redemption today same senator find stand uphold say theypropose fasten gold standard people country go prediction tell pass unconditional_repeal bill prosperity burst_bloom country do act repeal period distress business depression set equal tell pass bill legislation favor silver next session pass seigniorage bill veto sustain republican member veto tell addition pass unconditional_repeal bill insure international say say tend make foreign nation come agreement unconditional_repeal doubt bill pass condition thing bring today exception friend man other side believe gold standard faint hope international_binetallism come ~ tell pass bill danger bond issue pass say sell gold bond pass theydid andinmediatelyfollowe thepassage come sale bond way reflect credit man engineer transaction insist thatif yhrepeale act make condition next cry favor retire greenback count say man party dare stand american people advocate retirement greenback remember speak floor say time come retire greenback sell bond bondholder money_changer put absurd proposition silver dollar redeemable_gold say man idiotwould contend standard silver dollar redeemable_gold today take broad ground silver dollar redeem_gold seek way tohold few senator other side nerve kick conclusion indorse view express condition deal prophecy_prediction tell believe tell prediote twentyfive year prediction make knowledge come pass prefer take prophecy other say use bring resolution want pass tell reason want pass want serve notice attempt fasten gold standard peopleof thiscountry resist fight step want tell people vote democratic candidate determination today see wrong beenheape people right want tell bondholder issue issue man love country man despise injustice affiliation past hope believe rally standard bribery intmidation beat will majority people,55.0,bound,0,1

H.R. 15798. to extend for an additional temporary period the existing suspension of duties on certain classifications of yam of silk. introduced by myself and by Congressman HERLONG. is important to American industry and to American workmen. It would extend for 2 years. or until November 7. 1970. the existing temporary suspension of duties on certain yams wholly of noncontinuous silk fibers classifiable underitems 905.30 and 905.31 of the Tariff Schedules of the United States. No objection has been raised to this legislation. and the Department of the Treasury has stated by letter to the distinguished chairman of the Ways and Means Committee that it would have no objections to the enactment of the bill. The yams covered are of two principal types: standard spunsilkschappeyarn and silknolbourretteyam. Standard or schappe spunsilk yarns are used for making sewing thread. decorative stripings of fine worsteds. lacing cord and for cartridge bags. and. in combination with other fibers. certain types of necktie fabrics. shirtings. dress and suiting fabrics. upholstery and drapery materials. The silknoil type of yarn is made from shorter length. The chief use is in the weaving of silk cartridge cloth for powder bags for largecaliber ordnance. The suspension of the duty was made in order to enable domestic producers of fineyarn fabrics to import fine silk yarns free of duty and thus to make it more economical to produce fineyam fabrics in competition with imported similar fabrics. Failure to renew the suspension from duties would result in severe hardship to certain sections of the U.S. textile industry. Particularly at this time. it also should be noted that extension of the dutyfree treatment will have no unfavorable effect on the balance of payments. On the contrary. import duties. by raising the cost of silk yarns to domestic weavers. would make it impossible for them to compete. thereby increasing the quantity of silk fabrics imported from abroad. This would affect unfavorably the payments situation. Obviously.

Some of the points that I needed to make sure that I brought out and hit upon is that we have been trying for a very lengthy time to keep Hispanic children in schools. We have made that a priority. to help Hispanic students stay in school. The Hispanic education action plan targeted more than $30 million to help transform schools with high dropout rates. especially districts that have populations that are largely migrant workers. I say to my colleagues. you do not understand. or if you lived in my area you would have a good feel of how important this particular issue is. I have some schools that may have as high as a 70 percent dropout rate from high school of Hispanic children. and that does not make for a good economy anywhere in the.United States. Now. if we are able to help keep these young people in school and be able to provide any assistance. whether it is tutoring or any of the kind of family assistance that these children may need to be able to succeed. then we are helping. we are helping communities be more viable and helping our economy. because these young people will eventually become leaders in our areas. We also have to help students finish college. We proposed a new college completion challenge grant to help reduce the college dropout rate with prefreshman summer programs. support services and increased grant aid to students. This is a $35 million initiative to improve the chances of success for nearly 18.000 students. That may be a beginning. hopefully. because I know that more than 18.000 students not only are needy of being able to receive the assistance. but also Ire deserving of being able to get assistance from us. We need to turn around our failing schools. There are 11 million lowincome students now benefiting from Title I aid to the disadvantaged students. and all our children are benefiting from this higher expectation and the challenging curriculum that accompanies it. which is geared to higher standards. Our 2000 budget provides an additional $134 million. account bit fund. to help turn around the worst performing schools and hold them accountable for results. Now. 30 percent of children served by Title I are Hispanic. That tells us that we are failing our young people. We are not providing them with the tools to be successful. and consequently. I think that this Congress has done a great service to be able to target and begin focusing on those issues. I can tell my colleagues just quickly that the more we provide highquality teachers. and the more we provide smaller class size. the better our students are going to be. I can point to a group of middle school students that are going to be coming to New York to perform at Carnegie hall. These are middle school students out of one of my schools. one of my district schools. that have not only performed in the Rose Parade in Pasadena. but are also performing a full orchestratic ensemble in New York City. It is because they had a teacher who was of high quality. who cared about these young people and taught them that they can achieve anything they set their mind to. I am very proud of them. and I certainly want to share that with everybody so that others may learn that our youngsters. ages seven. eight. and nine. can also reach those heights. We have increased the funding for Pell grants. We have increased educational funding for migrant families. There are many of these important things for the State that I represent that are becoming viable for our people. and I certainly want to congratulate my democratic colleagues and those that helped us put these measures through. Again. education is the key for our young people to succeed. and I am glad to be here to be part of the thrust to achieve that for them.

1120058108,S,20110926,13,Ms. LANDRIEU,Unknown,LANDRIEU,Unknown,F,973,1621,09262011.txt,22140,1341,112117431,LANDRIEU,MARY,S,LA,F,D,,voting,"Mr. President. I wish to follow up on the remarks of Leader REID by reminding everyone how unfortunate but in some ways necessary this situation is. This whole debate. in my view. is worth having. It is unfortunate it is so close to the end of the year because the Senate actually offered a bill. as the Presiding Officer may remember. earlier in September to try to avoid getting to this last minute. But this whole controversy started just a few days after Hurricane Irene had raked the east coast and wreaked havoc from North Carolina. through Connecticut. into Vermont and New Hampshire. and people are still reeling. The way this controversy started was Representative CANTOR said: Before we can provide help. we need to find an offset in the budget. In other words. before we can help the victims of Irenethe thousands of homes that were flooded. the electrical wires on the ground. the businesses flooded outwe have to go to Washington and find a program to cut. I strongly objected then. and I have objected every day since then to that Cantor doctrine. So this is an argument and a debate worth having. This could have been completely avoided if. the day after. Representative CANTOR. with all the outcry from his own district and newspapers around the country. many of which editorialized against that position. would have just said: I am sorry. I made a mistake. And I have had to say that in my political career: I am sorry. I made a mistake. But instead of saying that. he doubled down. and he doubled down on the backs of people from Pennsylvania. to New York. and actually to Louisiana and Mississippi because it is our projects that have been stopped for the last 6 weeks. FEMA. as far as Louisiana is concerned. was out of money 6 weeks ago. This is what the Cantor doctrine looks like to a very clever cartoonist. I am going to put this up in my office and keep it forever. It says: Welcome to the Republican disaster relief hotline. At the tone. please tell us the emergency and how you plan to offset the cost of your rescue. Here is Grandmother sitting on the roof. with her little cat on the chimney. with her television and her cane. calling FEMA. I am the appropriations chair of this committee. as my colleagues know. It is a good thing I am chairing this appropriations committee because I happen to know a lot about disaster relief. having to lead the effort for the gulf coast in the wake of Katrina. Rita. Gustav. and Ike. This is not a little matter. as some of the press reported over the weekend. I have read most of the editorials from coast to coast. Some have written: Why is Congress arguing? This is such a minor matter. I dont think the $40 billion it took to rebuild the gulf coast is a minor matter. and I dont think any taxpayer in America would think $40 billion is a minor matter. This Cantor doctrine must be rejected. I am not the only one who believes this. There are wonderful articles and editorials in papers all across the country. I am going to read some of them today. I am so glad people were working through the weekend and focusing on this debate. From Colorado. the Denver Post writes: ... and some Members of Congress are so bent on budget cutting They are referring to the Republicans. of coursethat they happily seize the opportunity to demand concessions. despite the larger impact on our struggling economy. In this case. it is demanding that money for the Federal Emergency Management Agency to provide emergency disaster assistance to communities hit by flood. fire. and other manner of natural disasters. be offset by comparable cuts to the Federal budget. Demanding such offsets is unprecedented in terms of emergency relief. and it has again manufactured the prospects of a shutdown. To be clear. we are not supporting a blank check And neither am I. I have been an appropriator since I was 23 years old. I am 56. I understand balanced budgets and debt limits and curbing government spending. I have been a part of those efforts. The last time we had a balanced budget. a Democrat was in the White HouseBill Clintonas the Presiding Officer knows. We understand there is no such thing as a free lunch or a blank check. and we are going to pay for these disasters. but we dont have to pay for them while Grandmother is on the roof. We can figure out how to pay for it later and send help to her now. The article goes on to say: ... but we think any nearterm spending cuts are best dealt with by the super committee as opposed to a symbolic standoff that sends ripple effects beyond Washington. This is the Brattleboro Vermont Reformer: Though individuals eligible for Federal disaster aid and State and city governments recouping emergency response costs are still receiving funds. projects dating back as far as Hurricane Katrina are once again waiting for money. How did House majority leader Eric Cantor of Virginia respond? He said: ""Change like this is hard."" The paper goes on to say: However. not as hard as waiting for power lines to get restrung along the Auger Hole Road. wondering when. if ever. you will be able to move back into your waterlogged home or when your road might become passable again. Though Congress has about a week to get everything ironed out. we can expect this argument to go down to the last minute. I wish we werent here at the last minute. I wish to remind everyone that the Senate passedwith a bipartisan response to this. which provided the money FEMA needed without the offsetit was passed bipartisanly with 10 Republicans and all the Democrats and sent to the House. They could have passed that bill. and we would all be gone now. with FEMA replenished. set up for the next year. and the jobs program. which is really a private sector effort to create jobs in America. would be untouched and would be moving forward. This argument started when Representative CANTOR came up with a new tea party agenda. which is for flood victims to let FEMA know what offset can be required before they are rescued. Other newspapers throughout the country. including Pennsylvania. say: Much of northeast Pennsylvania needs Federal assistance to recover from flooding. but two of the regions representatives In this case. both Republican Representativesoffered an unacceptable condition. They go on to saythey list the Members. They say: The problem isnt the Senate. which earlier had passed a bill by a positive vote that included 10 Republicans to appropriate more than $7 billion for FEMA that handles disaster relief. That fund could run dry. The House responded with a bill that would provide $3.7 billion. but only if two loan programs for energy development projects were rescinded. Senator HARRY REID. they say. ""goes on to offer a compromise with the House."" But I guess we are in the time of no compromise and take whatever hostages you can. In this case. the tea party Republicans want to take hostage the Grandma who is on her roof asking for help. Even the New York newspapers: Congress shouldnt allow disaster aid for people devastated by Tropical Storm Irene to be stalled by a fight over how much is enough and how to cover the tab. We are willing to negotiate with the House over how much. We believe our number of $6.1 billion is not enough for the year. and I think the records will show as we move forward that I am accurate. But given the situation we are in. we dont need to fight over that amount because if $6.1 billion isnt enough. most certainly $3.5 billion that the House has offered isnt enough. and we can work that out later on and that is what Leader REID has offered. But requiring an offset. particularly an offset from a program that Republicans themselves supported. that was signed into law by President Bush. and that is supported by the chamber of commerce. the National Manufacturers Association. the League of Cities. the National Conference of Mayors. and an offset that has created 40.000 jobs. that is a road I dont think we should go down. If it is a manufacturing program today that the new Cantor doctrine requires. as one of these great articles this weekend said. maybe next time we have a disaster. we will have to offer up education programs. and the next time we have a disaster. we will have to offer up a fourth of our transportation budget. and the next time we have a disaster. we will have to offer up aid to Israel. or maybe the next time we have a disaster. we will have to offer up something else. When does the offering up stop? The worst time to negotiate how to find funding after a disaster is when emotions are high. when people are really at their sort of emotional limit. particularly the disaster victims themselves. We want to argue and debate these things when cool heads prevail and once we get the estimates. It is hard. within a week or two or three of an emergency. to even know what those estimates are. We have to wait for the insurance adjusters to go out. for the FEMA adjusters to go out. for people to even get back to their communities to assess the damage. Believe me. I have been through this. It was months after the aftermath of Katrina before people in my city of New Orleans and in parts of my State could even get back into their neighborhoodsmonths. Not days. not weeks. months. I remember people along the gulf coast having to come in on foot with chainsaws to try to get back. It took them days. That is another reason why we do not want to have to find an offset to fund disasters. We want to do a couple things. We want to budget as carefully as we can in advance. I want to answer this argument that: Oh. well. the reason Congress is in this pickle is because they did not budget for disasters. I am going to put up a chart in a minuteif staff will grab that one for meto show that we have budgeted for disasters. We have not budgeted as adequately as we should. This has been a problem for Democratic Presidents and Republican Presidents. But I have to say. as chair of this committee. I have doubled the amount of moneymore than doubled the amount of moneyin anticipation of disasters to try to get in front of it. But no oneunless they had a crystal ballcould have predicted that 48 out of 50 States would have had disasters this year in America. It is unprecedented. We would have had to have a crystal ball that was always right and never. ever wrong to be able to predict we would have had that many disasters. What can we do in the future? I have offered to my colleaguesSenator BLUNT. Senator SNOWE. and othersthat I will work with them in the future to get a bill that mandates that Democratic and Republican Presidents. regardless of party. would have to send to usbudgeted and paid forat least a 10year average of previous disasters. But I have to say. even if we would have had that law in placewhich is the best we can all collectively think of. and universities or businesses would recommend the samewe still would have underestimated this last year. and we still would have underestimated Katrina and Rita. That is why I am on the floor making this argument. I know it is inconvenient for Members to have to come back this week. I know people wanted to be away this week to work in their districts. But this is an argument and a debate worth having. I hope our side will prevail. but if not. at least we put up the fight that I think is necessary to make the argument to the American people. But even if we had a crystal ball and even if we had budgeted more than the $1.8 billion we budget every year. approximately. out of Homeland Security. look what happened when Katrina and Rita and Wilma hit. This went up to $45 billionKatrina. Rita. and Wilma. Wilma. you will remember. was one of the storms that hit Florida. In the year before. Florida had four storms. Dennis. Ivan. Frances. and Charley hit Florida in 1 year. I believe that is why Senator RUBIO and Senator NELSON understand the hollowness and the danger of the Cantor doctrine. Because had this doctrine been in effect when these four hurricanes hit Florida back in 2004. the people of Florida would have had to come to Congress. and before we could spend one dime to help them. we would have had to find a $3 billion offset. Mr. President. maybe we would have gone to your State and taken the money out of your transportation program or gone to my State or gone somewhere to find $3 billion. but we did not. We sent Florida their $3 billion. and we will pay for it over time. I do not know what we would have done on the gulf coast had the people of the United States enforced the Cantor doctrine. which was to find $45 billion like thatlike thatbefore we could have sent money to Mississippi. Alabama. Louisiana or Texas. I could go on and on and on. One of the more disappointing positions Republicans are holding. particularly Representative CANTOR. which is very disappointing. is that we have to scramble to find offsets for Americans who are in trouble. but we can just send free money to Iraq and Afghanistan. We do not have to send an offset to rebuild Iraq. We do not have to find an offset to rebuild Afghanistan. But we have to scramble around here and find an offset to help the people of our country. Third point. Some of the House Members have stood and said: Senator LANDRIEU is wrong. We have offset emergency funding in the past. That is correct. We have offset emergency funding. but emergency funding is different than FEMA funding. We have emergencies such as dams break and levees break and the Corps of Engineers needs extra money. Over the course of time. we have. occasionallybecause we want to be responsible with the budget when we can. and when we have time to figure it out. we most certainly can find offsets in programs that are not working as well. So we can eliminate that and push some of that money to emergency funding. We have done it in the military. We have done it for the Corps of Engineers. But if we do this. this will be the first time we have required an offset for FEMA funding in the history of our country. I think it is a road we do not want to go down. and it can be avoided. We do not have to walk down this road. We can eliminate the offset completely. FEMA mayunder the last 24 to 48 hoursbe able to stretch their money through Friday. We can even accept the House number. which is the lower number. It is not going to be adequate. We are going to be back here literally in 8 weeks having the same debate. But they are hardheaded and insistent that they want to continue to have this debate week after week after week. But at least the $3 billion will jumpstart all our programs that are stalled and many of them are in my State. which is why I am spending a lot of time on this. but I am also concerned about everybody elses State. It will give us enough money to get through Thanksgiving. maybe the first of the year. It is not going to be enough for all next year. That is a reasonable compromise. On the side of that compromise is the Chamber of Commerce. the National Association of Manufacturers. four Governors of disasterhit Statestwo Republicans and two Democratsthe National League of Cities. and the National Conference of Mayors. That is just to name a few. There are editorials across the country from Pennsylvania to New York. to Louisiana. The TimesPicayune. my own newspaper. of which I am very proud. editorialized for this position that to require an offset before one can be rescued is not the American way. We do not require it when we declare war or disaster. We go ahead and send the troops. and we fund them later. I do not believe we want to go down this road. So Leader REID has brought us back to try to work through it. Again. the Senate. earlier in September. passed a bipartisan resolution. The House rejected it for their own reason. insisting that we have an offset. We are back saying that is a wrong policy to adopt. This is not the right time in America to adopt it. If we were going to adopt it. this is definitely the wrong program to eliminate. This program has created. with the private sectorthis is not government jobs. These are private sector jobs that have been created. Republican leaders in the Houseand I am going to read those letters for the RECORD this afternoon againsupported the program. wrote letters to the Secretary asking for this funding to be spent in their districts. and then they turn around and offer this as an offset when it is unnecessary. unprecedented. and absolutely wrongheaded. For the legislators. the Congress men and women along the gulf coast. it is particularly disturbing. After receiving $45 billionMississippi. Louisiana. and Texasafter Katrina and Rita and not one penny offset while it was going onwe are all going to be paying for it for many years to come in our regular budgeting processto then turn around and say. when the east coast needs help: Oh. no. we need to find an offset today. That is how this argument started. I do not like to fight. I like to cooperate. I am one of nine siblings. I have two children myself. I have been happily married to my husband for 23 years. We resolve things by talking and negotiating in our home. We do not like to fight in our family. But I have learned one thing: Some things are worth fighting for. win or lose. I have led this effort. I have been proud to lead it. I am so grateful to my colleagues on the Democratic side. both in the House and the Senate. who have spoken on this point. who have changed their schedules to support this. Win or lose. it is right to stand against the Cantor doctrine and the tea party agenda. I guess this is where this comes from. We have never seen this before. Never have we offset a dime of FEMA funding. We have offset emergency funding. we have offset defense emergencies. Corps of Engineers emergencies. HUD community development block grant money we have offset but not FEMA. But the Republican caucus in the House has run us right down to the wire. not willing to negotiate. not willing to even recognize the bipartisan bill we sent over there. Sometimes we say ""bipartisan"" around here if we have one Republican and all the Democrats. We kind of brag because we have bipartisanship. This was 1010Republican Senators. That is a big number today. We broke a Republican filibuster on this with 10 Republican Senators who said ERIC CANTOR was wrong. Now is not the time. We do not have to find an offset. Lets negotiate. Lets work through this. They were right. I hope they will stand strong. I hope the leadership can work this out. But. again. if we cannot. it was worth. in my view. the fight over this to say: The Cantor doctrine is dangerous for the country. Let me just remind everyonebecause I have spoken about the gulf coastthese are 48 States represented that have been hit by disasters. The only States that have been spared a natural disaster are Michigan and West Virginia. But as the Senators from Michigan will tell us. they have been experiencing their own economic disaster now for almost 6 years. an economic meltdown in Michigan. Because of the crash of the auto industry and the foreclosure disaster and the crash of some of the Wall Street banks and other banks. Michigan has been very hard hit. West Virginia is always one of our poorer States. with great assets. but they struggle all the time. So we can honestly say all 50 States are in need of help. Why dont we help them? We have a supercommittee set up. Many of us are working hard on closing the deficit gap. We have already cut trillions. literally trillions. of dollars from this budget over the last 2 years. We have trillions more to cut and we have revenues to raise. But this time we have to find money in this budgetin this case for something that is wholly unprecedented and unnecessarythey recommend a program that is actually helping to turn around a very weak job outlook. It is creating jobs. It has created 40.000. It could create more publicprivate partnerships. promoting loans to auto companies that are creating new and different kinds of automobiles so we can minimize our dependence on foreign oil. we can start building again in America. we can start manufacturing again in America. Again. it is a programsome of the newspapers reported itDemocrats support. This is a program George Bush signed into law. This is a program that Republicans and Democrats have supported. This is a program that actually works to put Americans back to work. Why would they pick this one? Why would they pick any one? But why would they pick this one? Because they wanted to pick a fight. and they knew we were not just going to say: OK. fine. So we did not pick this fight. I did not pick this fight. Representative CANTOR started it when he decided on a Cantor doctrine that would make disaster victims have to find an offset before they could be helped. I am going to close with where I started. with this cartoon that says it all: Welcome to the Republican disaster relief hotline. At the tone. please tell us the emergency and how you plan to offset the cost of your rescue. ... This is not America. We have gone too far. If this kind of government is on the tea party agenda. I suggest they remove that item for consideration. This is not the way we operate our government in the United States. We are there for people in their time of need. We do not ask them to find an offset. We will pay for this. We are working to have our budget balanced. But we do not put this kind of pressure on taxpaying Americans. who hardly ask us for anything. But when their home is washed away. when their business is destroyed. they expect FEMA to be there and they do not have to scramble around with their congressional delegation or their mayors or their counsel members or their local representatives to wring their hands and say: What program can we suggest Congress cut so we can get our meals today or our shelter for next week? It is not the way we do business. I hope as Members come back tonight to talk about this. we can find a way forward. keep our government operating. and do what is right for Americans and our country. I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n'",wish follow remark remind unfortunate way necessary situation whole debate view worth have unfortunate close end year offer bill remember

We have received input from thousands of farmers and ranchers and others interested in this legislation. We address the reform that has been requested in a farm bill. We have addressed the concerns about more funding for fruits and vegetables for nutrition and conservation and renewable fuels. And then to have this tax increase injected into this process after the bill has left the committee is why you have heard every single Member on this side of the aisle speak about how they feel betrayed by this process. It is unfortunate for us. but it is also unfortunate for this farm bill because what happens when it leaves the House. if it passes at all. will be very different than if it passed leaving this House with a vetoproof majority. That opportunity has been lost. I would say to those on the other side of the aisle we can fix that if we would simply slow down and take a look at the appropriate way to pay for the additional funding that is due this committee because we took a $60 billion cut in the budget. The way to do that is to vote for the motion to recommit that we .will offer later on that will say you can have this farm bill that we have all praised and send it back to the committee to look for an appropriate way to do this without pitting American agriculture against American industry by having a tax increase imposed to pay for the things that are in this bill. Thats the appropriate way to proceed here. That would restore the bipartisanship that is needed in this process. and that would restore a good future for this farm bill. which is very much endangered because of the injection of this partisan tax increase that has been laid at our doorstep. the most bipartisan committee in the House of Representatives that has worked so hard and so long. And to be faced with this at the end is wrong.

I support S. 2375. the Health Professions Training and Distribution Act of 1980. and urge the Senate to adopt this measure today. This bill constitutes a comprehensive revision of titles VII and VIII of the Public Health Service Act. affecting the training of health personnel and nurses. Health professions education legislation has existed since 1963 and has been renewed several times since then. most recently in 1976. On December 27. 1979. I became the first to introduce legislation to comprehensively reauthorize these two titles. The goal of my bill. S. 2144. was to maximize Federal impact on the health professions and nursing without extravagant spending or regulation and while meeting the legitimate needs of both students and schools. Subsequently. Senator KENNEDY introduced S. 2375. a somewhat different proposal for revising titles VII and VIII. and Senator JAVITS introduced a bill. S. 2378. dealing with support for health administration programs and foreign medical graduates. A compromise set of programs. combining elements of all three bills. was adopted by the Subcommittee on Health and Scientific Research on May 24 and by the full committee When I introduced S. 2144. I noted that I was particularly proud of this bill because I believe it met three important tests by which legislation should be judged. First. it would accomplish national goals in a direct and positive manner. Second. it represented a fiscally sound approach. blending needed budgetary restraint with adequate funding for programs that met serious educational and health care problems. Third. the bill carefully avoided the imposition of further regulatory schemes upon our citizens. I noted my conviction that with encouragement from us. many health professionals would do voluntarily what we could not ask them to do otherwise. My bill provided considerable encouragement for individuals to practice their health profession in underserved areas and to provide primary care. and for health professional schools to each more about health promotion and disease prevention. health care policy and economics. and nutrition. The principles of my billachievement of national goals. fiscal restraint. and use of inducements rather than regulatonsare well represented in the final version of S. 2375. as well as many programs and concepts from my bill. The key elements of S. 2375 as amended are:\n',support urge adopt measure today bill constitute comprehensive revision title affect training health personnel nurse health profession education legislation exist renew several time become first introduce legislation reauthorize title goal bill maximize federal impact health profession nursing extravagant spending regulation meet legitimate need student school introduce different proposal revise title introduce bill deal support health administration program foreign medical graduate compromise set program combine element bill adopt full committee introduce note proud bill believe meet important test legislation judge accomplish national goal direct positive manner represent sound approach blend need budgetary_restraint adequate funding program meet serious educational health_care problem bill avoid imposition further regulatory scheme citizen note conviction encouragement many health professional ask bill provide considerable encouragement individual practice health profession underserved_area provide primary care health professional school more health promotion disease prevention health_care policy economic nutrition principle billachievement national goal fiscal restraint use inducement regulatonsare represent final version many program concept bill key_element amend,96.0,bound,1,0

Particularly distressing was the failureor unwillingnessof the Naval Inspector Generals Office and the Naval Investigative Service to work cooperatively prior to and during the investigation. Equally inexcusable was the calculated decision not to Interview officers above the grade of lieutenant commander. an unmistakable demonstration of cronyism within the Navy. The Department of Defenses report proves. beyond any reasonable doubt. that the mistakes. prejudices. and infighting that occurred during the Tailhook investigation were Inexcusable--particularly given the nature of the allegations. If this Nation has learned nothing else during the course of the last year. it is that sexual harassment charges must not be taken lightly. As women have moved into traditionally male dominated occupations. they are highly competitive within the employment chain. Women seek and deserve to be treated as equals. The blatant sexual harassment that occurred at the 1991 Talihook convention and the investigation thereafter constitute a slap at every woman in our Armed Forces and to every woman who has struggled to be treated with dignity and respect in the workplace. Mr. President. the reports from the Tailhook incident are appalling. But for the victims of this incident. the fear. mistreatment and degradation did not end there. It is shameful that the women who brought forth their claims were scorned and that the investigation that followed was simply a farce. Had the DODs inspector general led the investigation from the beginning. the entire process could have been effective. and could have demonstrated our armed services commitment to its women members. What was demonstrated instead was an inability to make the tough decisions needed to ensure a fair and thorough Investigation. The officers involved let their allegiance to the outdated culture within an institution and to their male colleagues overshadow their better judgment. This lapse is inexcusable. It is entirely appropriate that four of the five officers involved in the Tailhook investigation will lose their positions or be forced to retire as a result. If simply human decency does not convince all members of the military to treat women employees with respect. disciplinary actions should. I hope. Mr. President. that Tailhook and its investigation will be used in the future as the impetus for every military branch to help root out sexual harassment. and that this will be the final chapter in a book that dishonors what has been otherwise a fine institution that has served its country well.\n',clear last report convention selfevaluation deplorable incident fair objective distress unwillingnessof work investigation inexcusable calculate decision interview officer grade_lieutenant commander unmistakable demonstration cronyism report prove reasonable doubt mistake prejudice infighting occur investigation inexcusable give nature allegation nation learn course last year sexual_harassment charge take woman move male dominate occupation competitive employment chain woman seek deserve treat equal blatant sexual_harassment occur convention investigation constitute slap woman woman struggle treat dignity respect workplace report incident appalling victim incident fear mistreatment degradation end shameful woman bring claim scorn investigation follow farce inspector_general lead investigation beginning entire process effective demonstrate armed service commitment woman member demonstrate inability make tough decision need ensure fair thorough officer involve let allegiance outdated culture institution male colleague overshadow well judgment lapse inexcusable appropriate officer involve investigation lose position force retire result human decency convince member military treat woman employee respect disciplinary_action hope investigation use future impetus military branch help root sexual_harassment final chapter book dishonor fine institution serve country well.\n,102.0,daily,1,0

I thank the distinguished gentleman from Pennsylvania for allocating to me this time in order to discuss my ideas as to what I have long thought with reference to the foreign aid bill. Mr. Chairman. as the members of this committee know. I am not a supporter of this bill. One of the reasons for my not supporting it is that every time I have a faint hope that possibly there is something about the bill that I can support. or that I find commendable. I run into a snag. Mr. Chairman. the purpose of this bill as I have understood it during the time I have been here is to try to convert minds to democracy in order to combat the Communist thinking and the Communist program and to show that our system is the superior system and the free world system is the system that should be followed. Mr. Chairman. we build dams. we build roads and we build factories in order to show that with our funds we can stimulate the people in the countries in which these projects are constructed to follow a free world pattern. But are we really capturing the minds and the thoughts of the people? Once the factory is built. it is soon forgotten who built it. Once the dam is constructed and the water is backed up and the wheels begin to turn on the power. the credit is taken by whomever is in local authority at the time. He may remain our friend but when he has gone. how about the young people. the masses? Mr. Chairman. one thing that has appealed to me with reference to this program has been the educational program. There is a university located in Mexico City called the University of the Americas which was formerly Mexico City College. This college was started in 1940. It was started by Americans and the board was composed of American citizens. Recently the former president of Texas Christian University took over as president of the University of the Americas. He stated that this college has been known as ""a gringo college. Let us change it."" He changed the name and expanded the board and brought in Mexican citizens. It now has a board consisting of both Mexicans and North American citizens. He is undertaking to make this a university which will bring about a melding of the minds and thoughts between North and Latin America. Mr. Chairman. he asked me: Can we get any assistance under the foreign aid program? I have had a Mexican citizen give me a new campus. and I want to know if I can borrow any money under the foreign aid program. Mr. Chairman. he spent a week up here and he has not obtained a nickel or has not been able to come up with any encouragement to speak of as yet. Mr. Chairman.

This legislation has absolutely nothing to do with navigation. I went through this 18 years ago in Geneva. when they wanted to extend the limit to 12 miles. This bill has absolutely nothing to do with navigation. Saying that is like seeing a Halloween goblin. Do you think anyone will stop navigation going through the Straits of Gibraltar because we want to protect our fishery resources. Mexico now is claiming a 200mile limit. and it seems to me that to negotiate with Mexico. which would involve a lot of my friends and yours in the tuna industry. we have to deal from the same deck. We cannot go into this game with us not having anything and them having the 200mile limit. I know that a lot of tuna fishermen in San Pedro are worried. and they are very vocal. jut I know of a few thousand up in northern California and southern Oregon where the ocean perch. which they live on. are gone. absolutely gone. As to the tuna thing. we catch tuna within the coastal zones of nations which already have 200 mile zones. There is a tuna agreement. So I hope that between now and tomorrow the Senator will change his mind on this issue. because I do not see any valid argument from the tuna people at all. May I have the attention of the Senator from California? I think the argument that somebody is going to retaliate on navigation or air space because we protect our own fisheries is ridiculous. They would have not standing any place to do that. That would be like saying the Sultan of Morocco and the King of Spain are going to say nobody can go through the Straits of Gibraltar because the Americans want to fish their own fish off their own shores. How ridiculous can you get? The military worries about this all the time. They opposed the 12mile limit. As a matter of fact. at one time I thought at Geneva they were going to oppose the 3mile limit. There is no indication whatsoever that there would be retaliation in that way. Navigation is going to be taken up by the Law of the Sea Conference. navigation and an economic resource zone. Someone said to the Senator from Alaska. why should we not do this for minerals? But the minerals are going to be there. the oil is going to be there. but the fishlook at that chartare going down and down and down.

I insist that we must consider the subject matter of this legislation as being composed of two absolutely separate and distinct phases or elements. the first having to do. of necessity. with the hurried appropriation of public funds to continue such direct relief as admittedly is immediately. or relatively immediately. necessary. the second having to do with the carefully studied preparation of a longrange plan or policy to create. as rapidly as possible. gainful employmentemployment that will at least have some hope of becoming selfsupporting in the future in the normal economic sense of not being dependent on governmental contributions. I may say right here that whether we spend four billion or fourteen billion dollars. I have no feeling of assurance that such a socalled "" publicworks program"" as apparently is contemplated by this measure will result in real recovery as far as selfsupporting prosperity in the future. in the normal. nonartificially stimulated sense. is concerned. The joint resolution leaves so much to the imagination that I may not have guessed its fuller meaning. but it certainly is too big a bet for me to wager until I know more about the odds. I do know. however. that it is manifestly unfair. though it may be good political strategy. to force the Members of the Senate. as was done when the joint resolution was jammed through the House of Representatives. either to swallow the measure ""whole hog "" or to be put in the false position of apparently voting against a necessary appropriation of funds for direct relief. admittedly more or less immediately needed. In other words. in my judgment. it is obviously unjust and unwise to try to force the Senate to treat these two wholly different. though related. subjects as one. Surely $880.000.000. or any such sum. is not of itself such an inconsequential pittance. viewed in these days of exaggerated perspective. as not to warrant consideration standing alone on its own merits. without being tagged on to some much greater sum in order to make the whole worthy of our thought and consideration. Any proper appropriation for necessary direct relief. standing by itself. will. of course. pass both the Senate and House at once. and undoubtedly unanimously. Who would vote against it. or would want to do so? Any delay that may result in respect to the appropriation of the remaining four billions. or whatever the amount may be. will be time well spent indeed. for I am becoming more and more convinced that perhaps even more than the huge sums themselves incurred in each instance. the greater danger involved in the whole presentday philosophy of spending. especially without attempting to raise by taxation the money to pay the piper as we go along. is the apparently growing utter disregard for the real value of moneywhat it means. what is the cost. and where it must come fromwhich we unconsciously. perhaps. but none the less certainly are acquiring ourselves. and. in turn. are conveying. possibly unwittingly. to others. to the end that all of us. in and out of public life. are fast forming the subconscious belief that the Federal Treasury is inexhaustible. and that the donation of public funds for whatever cause is simply controlled by the degree of generosity in each instance exhibited on the part of those who hold the purse strings. with inevitably. as part of the insidious cycle. the greatest political popularity accruing to those who are apparently the most generous the most often. Thus will still greater appropriations inevitably follow with increasing frequency. and more and greater political popularity accrue to those who initiate and support them. and so on. ad infinitum. Am I exaggerating? Can I be accused of partisan. nonconstructive criticism if I venture the suggestion that possibly a political Frankenstein monster may thus be in creation. which from time to time is being ever strengthened. to the end that not only those who. regardless of party affiliation. oppose the creation of such a robot. but those who. however unintentionally. gave it birth. will find themselves one day. even if they all combine against it. unable in the end to check its menace to our democratic form of government. to which this country is dedicated. and which we are all sworn to preserve and protect. I am in accord with the general premise of the President. recently enunciated before the Congress in his annual message. that ""the Government must get out of this business of relief."" I am in full accord also with the general premise that direct reliefor. to speak more plainly. the dolehas within it the seed of disintegration of the moral fiber of our citizens. of which moral fiber we have always been so justly proud. Here again. however. we must. in the practical sense. weigh the relative costs of all these different forms of governmental aid. and ask ourselves the question: Which plan can we afford. and which program will hold out until the country shall at last be able to go ahead as heretofore under its own power without contributions. by whatever term they may be called. from the Federal Treasury? Contributions which we all know today are in excess of our ability or desire. certainly one or the other. actually to pay for as we appropriate them. other than through the medium of everincreasing bond issues. which are piling up to haunt us in the future. for generations to come. When is this patient we are continually doctoring going really to get well? How much more medicine must he take? Or is the medicine. perchance. of a sort so palatable that he is coming to prefer it to being cured? To revert to the terms of the joint resolution itself. as I have said. it leaves much to the imagination. to put it mildly. but aside from making available such sum as may be necessaryand I assume that sum to be $880.000.000. though the joint resolution does not say soto provide for the necessary direct relief of today and the more or less immediate future. we are confronted with the amazing request that we divest ourselves of the responsibilities imposed upon us by the Constitution we have all sworn to uphold. by the simple expedient of turning over a blank check for nearly five billions of dollars to a single individual. even be heand I say this in all respectthe President of the United States. drawn in such general terms as to be payable to the order of ""providing relief from the hardships attributable to widespread unemployment "". ""relieving economic maladjustments "". ""alleviating distress "". and ""improving working conditions."" Especially amazing is this request in view of the fact. which of course must be recognized. that the President himself. however noble his intentions. however superhuman his energies. however wise his judgment. must of necessity delegate many of these powers in turn to othersothers to us as yet unknown. whose rulings are as yet undetermined. in respect to undertakings which in even a remotely specific sense are as yet undisclosed. rulings which are. moreover. to have the force of statute even to the point of the confiscation of property and the imposition of punishment in the form of fines. and this measure. as originally drafted by whomever it was who did draft it. permitted not only the imposition of fines but also the imprisonment of any offender against this new order of things! Contrast all this. if you please. with the methods employed in the handling of public funds for that great publicworks program of yesteryear. the building of the Panama Canal under the policies pursued by the late Theodore Roosevelt. The Congress in that day was asked to appropriate the thenstaggering sum of approximately $200.000.000. but in that case the expenditure was to be guarded by a bipartisan commission of outstanding citizens known to all at that time and in whom all had confidence. and the project itself was not simply some vague general undertaking somewhere to facilitate navigation. but was a very definitely known and understood and carefully worked out project for a specifically designated purpose in an exactly described location. May we venture even further at this juncture and approach at this time the dawn of a new new deal that must inevitably come in respect to the whole general situation we have created by suggesting that we begin now. at the same time that we give study to this. the largest of all such undertakings of its kind in our history. to give study also to the rearrangement into their proper and logical spheres of the many activities. for instance. of the N. R. A.. legislating it as a separate entity out of existence. and transferring its good featuresand there are good featuresto the existing Cabinet departments. The all too numerous bureaus. commissions. and boards making up this gigantic bureaucratic. and increasingly bureaucratic. Government of ours today have the malignancy of a tumzr and its persistency for growth. It is time. I feel. that we give really exhaustive thought to this whole problem. broad as I know it is. to the end that the form of government to which we are dedicated shall not in time be smothered by this growth of a new kind of government. In conclusion. if this measure comes up for passage in anything like its present amazing form. I have no alternative but to vote against it. and I shall do so. but I protest now and vehemently against a stratagem that places me in the false position of apparently voting against any sum that is needed to alleviate human suffering unless at the same time I vote for infinitely more of that whose very nature I know not. I am eager. as is everyone else in Congress. to vote for whatever is needed for direct relief at this time. and my pleamy earnest and sincere plea. yes. my demandis that we do just that. vote now such sum. whatever it may be. as is needed for this particular purpose. and. as time is the essence in this instance. let it be dealt with as we are now dealing with the distribution of public funds for this recognized and understood need. whether all of us like or do not like in all particulars the way in certain respects this necessary obligation of the Federal Government is being discharged. Let us now recognize. however. whether or not it be politically popular at the moment. the necessity of assuming our own obligations in these purely legislative matters. and put an end to this exhibition of shadow boxing with our constitutionally prescribed responsibilities. which now apparently is the order of the day. and is so perfectly exemplified by the joint resolution under discussion. which we are again asked to side step as far as doing our real duty in respect to it is concerneda measure which. while it boasts as its proud purpose ""making appropriations for relief purposes "". in reality makes no attempt. even in any remotely specific sense. to designate what is actually to be done with all this vast sum of money. or how it is to be expended. by whomexcepting

In using this severe language to this weak nation. which has hardly any military force that could possibly affect us. andwhich has hardly any money eitherin using this- severe language to her in regard to what she equitably owes us. let us be careful also to do equity on the noble maxim which myfriend from Iowa has laid down. I hope we shall remember itas a nation. and when I speak of equity I do not merely mean what has been agreed upon by a treaty. but I mean what is intrinsically just and right. My friend alluded to another point which is also one of great interest. He has great respect for the principle of arbitration. So have I. It is one upod which I have thought much. and in which I feel a deep interest. Some important petitions and papers hearing on the subject the Committee on Foreign Afilirs did mae the honor to refer to myself as a subcommittee during the present session. aid I have failed to report upon them to the committee and through the committee to the House only because I could not find a favorable occasion. or what seemed to me such. for doing it. I respect the priuciple of arbitration. I am anxious it should gain respect among the nations and gain favor. And I hope. even at my time of life. to live to see the day when there shall be much more regard among the great powers of the earth for the principle of arbitration than there ever has been heretofore. But. Mr. Speaker. I do not think that it will injure the respect for that principle if a great nation which fears that its citizens may have profited unjustly through fraud by an arbitration to which it was a party comes forward frankly and offers to suspend all claims under such arbitration in order to see that the right thing is (lone. My own opinion is that there is nothing in the world that could hurt the estimation in which the principle of arbitration could be held among the nations more or worse than to enforce unjust awards of arbitration. And if there is good reason for supposing that there has been fraud at the bottom of an arbitration. I should say that it would not tend to encourage the esteem in which arbitration is held to enforce such fraud. On the other hand. I should say that thenation which felt that it had profited by the fraud might come forward to great advantage and offer to surrender any advantages which it might have secured from fraud. How can it hurt the principle of arbitration for the nation which itself believes that it may have profited unrighteously to conic forward and offerto surrender the unrighteous fruits of a commission which may have been hold by it and an other nation I The moral effect of such a thing on the part of the United States must be good. It is not Venezuela that is pressing a reconsideration of these claims. I think Venezuela seems to have exhibited about as tuch diligence as she could in trying to meet these claims upon her front the United States. but the trouble is she has not any money in her treasury. and has not known how to meet them. although 1 believe she has several times protested her desire to meet them. For this Congress. for this country. for this great power to come forward and offer to do right and not to take advantage of the results of an unjust arbitration against a weak and defenseless nation. why. air. I IV--343 should say that the moral effect of that upon ourselves and the whole world could be nothing but good. I venture to say that the disposition on the part of the United States not to profit by frand. no matter how many abitrations would give us the profit. a disposition like that on the part of the United States. exhibited to the whole world would do us good. would do the civilized world good. would help the cause of arbitration. would honor God. and bless the human race.

Alito. Jr.. an outstanding choice for Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Judge Alito is indeed one of the most qualified nominees to ever come before the Senate. He has excelled at every levelhigh - school valedictorianPhi Beta Kappa from PrincetonYale Law SchoolEditor of the Yale Law JournalFederal prosecutordistinguished and esteemed judge. His judicial experience and record are vast. During his J5 years on the bench. Judge Alito has participated in more than 1.500 decisions. He has written more than 350. opinions on issues across the legal spectrum. Of the 109 men and women who have been chosen to serve this country on the Supreme Court. Judge Alito has spent more time on the Federal bench than all but four. And no nominee to the high court has come before this body in the last 70 years with as much Federal judicial experience. Judge Alito is precisely the type of person America needs on the Supreme Court. Yet. despite Judge Alitos obvious qualifications for this important post. some members of the other party have resorted to personal attacks in an effort -to deny this good and honorable public servant confirmation by the Senate. They have questioned his integrity. questioned his commitment to equal rights. and mischaracterized his rulings from the bench. But in reality. the hostility towards Judge Alito has nothing to do with his integrity. his commitment to fairness.. or even his view of executive power. Rather. these attacks are simply a pretext upon which to oppose Judge Alitos nomination. His critics real fear is that he will refuse to rubberstamp the agenda advanced by liberal interest groups. Make no mistake. they want Judge Alitoand the Supreme Courtto undermine marriage. religious expression. and protection of the unborn. I do not know how Judge Alito will ultimately rule when confronted with difficult questions of lawand neither do my colleaguesbecause Judge Alito has rightly refused to prejudge cases that may come before him. But we can all take comfort in the principles that will guide his approachrespect for the Constitution and the rule of law. a commitment. to hear all sides of an argument with an openmind. impartiality and fairness to all parties. big or small. powerful or powerless. Judge Alitos judicial record and Senate testimony demonstrate an unwavering dedication to these principles. His colleagues on the bench and in the Justice Department. his clerks. and so many others who know him well. have testified that Samuel Alito is a man who will approach his job without bias. Like John Roberts.. Samuel Alito understands that a Supreme Court justice should apply the law without regard to his personal views. I am confident that Judge Alito will bring this approach to the Court. Mr. President. there is no question that confirmation hearings can be long. stressful. and exhaustingnot only for the nominees but for their families and friends as well. But in earlier days. a nominee with Samuel Alitos intellect. qualifications. and integrity would have been confirmed with overwhelming support. Indeed. -the other side has not publicly ruled out the possibility of an attempted filibuster. I fear that this precedent will have a chilling effect--keeping our best and brightest from entering public service. The responsibility of the United States Senate to give advice and consent to a Sfipreme Court nominee is among the most significant given to us. It is vital to our Governments constitutional structure that the Senate discharge its duty by giving a Supreme Court nominee an up or down vote. And each Senator has ample resources upon which to make such a decision here. Judge Alito has a judicial record far surpassing that which has custonarily been available to us when considering a nominee for the highest court in the land. He also has answered more questions during the course of his hearing than any Supreme Court nominee in recent memory. If any question existed about Samuel Alitos integrity. judicial temperament. or qualifications for the Supreme Court. it was put to rest before the Judiciary Committee. I ask that my fellow Senators therefore vote to confirm Samuel Alito as Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court.

960069429,S,19790625,929,Mr. WEICKER,Unknown,WEICKER,Unknown,M,36821,36930,06251979.txt,4165,261,96107031,WEICKER,LOWELL,S,CT,M,R,,voting,Mr. President. when the Senate turns to the consideration of S. 712. the Amtrak Improvement Act of 1979. I intend to offer an amendment which will mandate that the Office of Technology Assessment. instead of the Secretary of Transportation. study the potential benefits and costs of a 55mileperhour speed goal for Amtrak. Western European countries and Japan place a great deal of emphasis on the research and development functions of their intercity rail passenger systems. As a result of this emphasis. there have been technological innovations in those countries which have enabled them to implement a rail system that can achieve speeds in excess of 100 miles per hour while assuring safety and comfort. Yet Amtrak trains average only 42 miles per hour. which is 13 miles per hour lower than the highway speed limits. Clearly. Amtrak will have a difficult time competing with the automobile if it cannot provide service at a comparable speed. Section 13 of S. 712 directs the Secretary of Transportation. in consultation with Amtrak. to study the potential benefits and costs of a 55mileperhour speed goal for Amtrak and to report the results of the study to Congress. This study promises to be very important to the future of Amtrak as a viable alternate mode of intercity transportation. It is because of the importance of the study that I am proposing that the Office of Technology Assessment. and not the Secretary of Transportation. conduct the study. We have recently seen an example of an Amtrakrelated study conducted by the Secretary of Transportation. That study resulted in a recommendation to cut 12.000 miles. or 43 percent. of the present Amtrak system. Yet only 4 months after making the recommendation. the Secretary has had to acknowledge that it was inaccurate and he has endorsed more Federal aid to maintain a nationwide rail system. I am also concerned that the Secretary does not have the objectivity necessary to insure a fair. meaningful study. Secretary of Transportation Adams has frequently indicated his preference for the automobile and his distaste for rail passenger service. In a letter to me dated March 22 of this year. the Secretary stated: * In the event of an energy emergency Amtrak could play no significant role In meeting the Nations passenger transportation needs.... It is also important to remember. when discussing energy conservation. that for the past 50 years Americans have shown a clear preference for the unrivaled flexibility and convenience of the private automobile ... Given the dominance of the automobile in American travel. It is clear that the largest payoff In energy conservation can be in making that travel mode more efficient. That is why I have challenged Americas automobile manufacturers to redesign the automobile to make it an even more efficient machine. and why I have committed so much of my own time and energy to that effort. Mr. President. the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce has stated thatDespite the conflicting studies and statistics advanced by proponents of various modes of transportation. it is widely recognized that with sufficient ridership levels and modern. stateoftheart equipment. the passenger train is the most energyefficient of all modes. Given the potential energyefficiency of Amtrak. it is important that an unbiased study be conducted. The Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) is perfectly suited to carry out this study. This office was created by the Technology Assessment Act of 1972 to provide an independent and objective source of information about the impact of technological applications. It is presently reviewing a comparison of American and Canadian rail safety. Pursuant to Public Law 94348. OTA published an evaluation of rail safety in May of 1978. Since its inception. OTA has also conducted studies of national rail issues. the financial viability of Conrail. and a railroad rehabilitation study. Mr. President. this amendment will insure that the feasibility of the adoption of a 55mileperhour speed goal by Amtrak will be objectively evaluated.

As a matter of fact. in fiscal years 1997 and 1998. when we still had deficits. the Congress spent less money than the actual budget caps allowed. But since the era of surpluses began in 1999. the Congress and the president have taken this to mean they now have a license to spend freely and irresponsibly without any adherence to limits. We have gradually spent in excess of the discretionary spending limits.

The CBO also warns that ""Projections of future economic growth and fiscal imbalances are quite sensitive to assumptions about what policymakers will do with the budget surpluses that are projected to arise over the next decade.""

I should be at a great disadvantage in the presentation of my views on this question if my purpose was to enlighten the Senate or the country either on the question of constitutional law involved in this great bill. for we have been listening with great attention and with every opportunity for instruction for the better part of three weeks to the opinions expressed by the most profound constitutional lawyers in this body upon the proposition whether. we have the authority to pass the bill. So I will be content to inform my constituents of my reasons for the vote I will give. The measure is the most magnificent in its proportions that was ever brought into the Senate of the United States. It is the first bill in which there is sought to be made an appropriation exceeding $100.000.000 by a single act for a specific purpose. and that not a governmental purpose. but a purpose. I may safely style it. of charity or of public benevolence. of public improvement. public cultivation. A measure having for its purpose the bettering of the condition of the private citizen. the mere unit. the atom in our great body politic. One hundred and five millions of dollars to be appropriated by a single act of Congress is the broadest proposition that has ever been presented to the consideration of American statesmanship. and when that sum of money is required for a single generation of people. to say nothing of the repetition of this and other greater suns that we may be forced to supply for the cultivation of succeeding generations of people. we must recognize the fact that we are laying broader foundations for benevolence and charity by this act than have ever been attempted by any act of the American Congress. The Legislatures of the States. so far as I am informed. have none of them instructed their representatives. or even advised them. that they should come here and appropriate $105.000.000 out of the Treasury for the purpose of public education. Not only have I not received such instructions from the Legislature of Alabama. but I have received no expression of opinion from the people of that State of any important or general character which would lead me to believe that they had prepared themselves for the introduction and the passage of this great measure at this time. The measure has been received in the Senate on both sides of the Chamber. without respect of party and without respect of sectional divisions. with rather a cold welcome. especially among some at least of the older members of this body.. They are afraid that they do not possess the constitutional power to do that which is required of them by the bill. I think the opinions which have been uttered in the Senate indicate at least thatthere is a very large division. ifnotabout an equal division. of opinion upon the grave question of the constitutional power of Congress to pass this proposed law. As the subject is new. as it is important. as it is very far reaching in its scope. it would seem to be a wiser policy to defer final action upon this measure until the people have been consulted throughout this great Union to ascertain whether they are willing that Congress shall exercise this new and hitherto untried power of appropriating money out of the Treasury of the United States for the education of their children. We have also made great progress during this session of Congress in the Senate in the passage of important bills. I am informed that we have passed now more than one hundred and sixty bills.which lie upon the Speakers table in the House of Representatives. Only thirteen of our bills have so far been considered in that body. and four of the joint resolutions we have passed out of eleven. This admonishes me that while the great length of time spent in this debate is not wasted. for it has been. I dare say. of great instruction to the people. it will be futile during this session of Congress. for the House of Representatives. we must understand. with the accumulation of business that it now has before it and with the appropriation bills still incomplete in that body. can scarcely give such attention to this subj ectas to warrant it in passing final judgment upon it at this session. We are admonished also by vares amendments that are put in here by Senators that the bill is not satisfactory in its details to many of them. The Committee on Education and Labor have given to it grave consideration. but they have discovered in the progress of the debate many infirmities in the bill which they themselves confess ought to be remedied by some amendment. and other Senators have suggested very important arrangements for the management and disposition of this fnd. for its distribution between the States. some upon the basis of illiteracy and some upon the basis of population. differing entirely from the suggestions made by the conunittee. I would content myself with a vote to recommit the bill. as it unquestionably should be recommitted. but for the fact that I have no expectation that any amendment that will be put upon the bill will make it more acceptable to me. The amendments. on the contrary. in the direction that they have taken indicate a purpose to make the measure a machine or an engine of control of the States by Congress in the administration of this fund. Those Senators who have offered amendments to the bill have not offered them in the direction of restraining the power of Congress in the management of this fund after it shall have reached the States. but to the reverse. their amendments nearly all looking to the proposition that Congress shall retain larger power over the school fund than the committee have retained for it in the bill as they have reported it. Hence I have no expectation that the bill 4ill be put into any bettor shape than it is now. so far as my views of it are concerned. by any amendment that may be offered or that may be passed in the Senate. Yet I shall be disappointed if some of the friends of the bill. on this. side of the Chamber. in their eagerness to get hold of the money which now stands so temptingly before us will not yield very much more than they have done in committee. or than they have done in their speeches. to the demand of Congress to control this fund afteritshall havereached the States in which it is to be expended. That is the drift of sentiment on this question. When we have laid the foundations of this new. assumption of power in this bill. as proposed by the committee. with such amendments as may be ingrafted upon it by a compromise or concession between the gentlemen on this side of the Chamber and the gentlemen on the other side of the Chamber. we shall then find ourselves in the opening march of that great progress toward thorough centralization which will result in the overturning of those conservative views. ofgovernient which have always characterized the greatparty of which I happen to be an humble member. It may be thought necessary for the general welfare that that conservative political organization should disband. but I am not prepared for that result as yet. Mr. President. I say it in no offensive sense. but if there was not $100.000.000 in the Treasury today. and if there was not a tax system yoked down upon the shoulders of the people of the United Statea which will yield a hundred million surplus revenue annually until we repeal or amend it. I venture to say that this bill would never have received one hours consideration in this body. If the revenues of the. United States Government had been limited to the necessary purposes of government alone. and if we werederiving through our tax system no. more revenue than is necessary to execute the great purposes of the Government. if we had a treasury which emptied itself regularly for. the purpose of supplying the Government with its needed resources for expenditure. this bill would never have fluttered upon the table of the President except in its death agony. It would have been passed by as an idle declaration in respect of the powers of Congress. having no immediate fruit to be distributed through the votes of Senators in this. body. and therefore no useful purpose. But I feel. and every Senator here must feel. that we are standing today in the presence a great temptation. a temptation that I would rid myself of fbr two reasons. first. personal to myself as an inducementto be extravagant and wasteful in the use of revenues collected from an overtaxed people to pay a& public debt and to get the country from beneath the terrible difficultie& engendered by war. and a temptation to take part in a propaganda of benevolence which appeals to the warmest sympathies of my nature. It is not necessary fbr me to annonnee upon the floor of the Senate that I am the friend of edheation. I have sufficiently experienced its wants to know its value. I was raised among a class of people who. were compelled to work f6r their living and to educate themselves at the same time. While they are not a learned class of people they are still not ignorant. Many men who have been raised among them without the advantages which are now possessed by those who have an ordinary commonschool education are now performing important public. funQtions in the United States and elsewhere in the world. Whatever. therefore. would contribute to place within reach. of their children the. advantages of better education than their fathers had must appeal naturally to my warmest sympathies. although I may not feel that they wilt ever dishonor their unlettered fathers by their ignorance of the learning of the books. More than that. I have had the opportunity on the floor of the Senate of expressing my views oni this question in former days both by speeches and by votes. and I have never failed to add what of encouragement I could to the cause of public education. I have only been careful to act within the limits of my duty in such matters. Then. because a large proportion of the money which may be received under the bill by the State of Alabama may be applied to the education of the negro children who are in that State is a matter that also. appeals to my personal sympathy and arouses within my heart a sea. timnent of strong desire that they should receive every advantage in this direction that we are capable of bestowing upon them. Not that I have realized in my experience (and therefbre I must say solemnly I do not believe) that the South is in the calamitous condition that has been. represented here by Senators who seemed to think that an argument drawn from the mise ry of their people is necessary to justify their course upon this bill. I stand here to deny upon facts and figures this accusation against us. of extreme and lamentable ignorance in the South. I realize thatit must be better for any community in the world that every man. woman. and child in it should have the opportunity to learn. and should. be capable of. reading and writing. In. other words. it would be a blessing if every child should have the foundations of a good English education laid as far as may be by the exertions of his father. or his friends. and. as far as may be necessary. by additional assistance of the government under which he may reside. But the education of a child by the exertions of its parents is a twofold blessing. in which each is benefited and made better. Nor. in rejectingthis overture made to thepeople of the South through this broad act of benevolenpe. as it is alleged to be and as I have no right to assume that it is not. am I in the slightest degree moved by any feeling of jealousy. pride. or resentment. or any of the lingering hates. if therewere hates. existing between us in former times. These reflections came to me as an embarrassment upon my condu t. for I am averse to standing upon punctilios. but they shall only make me more cautious in my action. and not lets resolute. My motives maybe misunderstood. but my votes here must have the approbation of my own conscience. The bill appropriates $105.000.000 to the cause of public education in the United States. excluding some of the States from its provisions. those that have npt 8 per cent. of the whole population who can not read or write. and it requires the Secretary of the Treasury upon certain certificates being made by the governors of the States to the Secretary of the Interior-\n',great disadvantage

I rise to introduce the ""Womens Small Business Programs Improvement Act of 2003"" in recognition of the critical potential that women entrepreneurs hold for the Nations economic welfare. I am pleased to be joined by Senators BOND and BURNS in offering this important legislation. Today. women own nearly a third of the Nations small businesses--totaling nearly 7 million womenowned enterprises that contribute approximately $1.2 trillion. to be economy annually. That number. however. does not include jointly owned businesses in which women play a major role but hold less than fifty percent of the ownership rights. So. the actual number of women with significant roles in business goes well beyond 7 millionand they are growing rapidly. These figures reflect the successes that women entrepreneurs are having despite facing the same challenges for the past twenty yearsaccess to business assistance. access to capital. and access to Federal Government contract opportunities. The ""glass ceiling"" in corporate America that led many women to start a small Lusiness has been transformed into a another obstacle-""a glass doorway""-between women who want to start and grow businesses and the lending and Federal contract markets these women entrepreneurs seek to enter. Overcoming these obstacles requires that women are provided the business assistance tools they need. which we can ensure through the programs and services established within the Small Business Administration. SBA. specifically for women. As the new Chair of the Committee on Small Business. I have been carefully examining the SBAs programs with a particular focus on the agencys initiatives that are intended to foster womenowned businesses. During the past year. witnesses and participants of the Committees hearings and roundtables clearly identified the concerns of women business owners: the lack of business assistance programs for existing small businesses. scarcity of financial resources for startup or expansion. limited opportunities for Federal Government contracts. and the need for specific research on womens business ownership. In addition. we heard concerns from the Womens Business Centers and their advocates about the Womens Business Centers Sustainability Grants Program. which sunsets in 2003. These centers have been extraordinarily successful in providing assistance to women in all walks of lifethose who once received public assistance but now operate businesses and create jobs. women transitioning from employee to small business employer. and establish womenbusiness owners who create and manufacture products for sale at home and abroad. The Centers nurture women entrepreneurs through business and financial planning and help with critical issues like securing funding for startup and expansion. Despite these successes. however. funding questions have long plagued the program. Adding to the information gained from its official activities. the Committee staff also conducted a review of all SBA funded and sponsored activities for women entrepreneurs. held discussions with women business leaders. and obtained information in the process of preparing for the reauthorization of SBA NonCredit Programs. Our findings support specific changes to ensure that the SBA will be more accountable in its delivery of programs and services through the Office of Womens Business Ownership. Specifically. based on the need and the impressive record of the Womens Business Centers. there is strong support for making the program permanent. provided that the SBA streamlines the grants administration processes. Improvements in the focus and operations for the National Womens Business Council and the Womens Interagency Committee on Womens Business Enterprise would also enhance their missions and ability to serve women entrepreneurs. The bill I introduce today is designed to address these issues and improve the programs and services that the SBA delivers across the nation for women business owners through the Office of Womens Business Ownership. the Womens Business Centers Program.. the National Womens Business Council. and the Interagency Committee on Womens Business Enterprise. The key elements of the bills improvements will provide direction. consolidation and integration of existing programs that have been previously created to offer opportunities for women through their entrepreneurial endeavors. The ""Womens Small Business Programs Improvement Act of 2003"" would improve the entrepreneurial environment for women seeking assistance and opportunity through Federal Government sponsored programs. A key to the success of this bill is the integration of all internal and external SBA programs and partnerships. The provisions in this bill are timely and in response to tlhe many concerns of women business owners that I have received from my constituents in Maine and from across the country through the Small Business Committee. Additionally. the bill makes the Womes Business Center a permanent program for existing eligible Centers so that women can depend on the experienced services of small business longterm counseling and small business education and training. The Centers have proven to be a great value the communities they servo so we must ensure that their programs and services continue to be available. The ""Womens Small Business Programs Improvement Act of 2003"" ensure that women entrepreneurs at all stages of business ownership get the assistance they need so that success through business growth is more easily obtained. And it achieves that goal. not by establish costly new initiatives. but by building on successful establish programs within the SBA and improving their delivery for the benefit of current and future women entrepreneurs. As the Small Business Committee continues its work on legislation to reauthorize the SBA. we will be addressing all of the agencys programs. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate to ensure that the provisions of this bill are included so the growth of women owned business in America can reach its full potential. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and a sectionbysection analysis be printed into the RECORD.\n'","rise introduce recognition critical potential woman entrepreneur hold economic welfare pleased join offer important legislation today woman own third small business total womenowned enterprise contribute economy number include own business woman play major role hold less percent ownership right actual number woman significant role business go millionand grow figure reflect success woman entrepreneur have face same challenge past yearsaccess business assistance access capital access contract opportunity glass_ceiling corporate lead many woman start small transform obstacle-""a glass_doorway""-between woman want start grow business lending federal contract market woman entrepreneur seek enter overcome_obstacle require woman provide business assistance tool need ensure program service establish woman new examine sbas program particular focus agencys initiative intend foster womenowned_business past year witness participant hearing roundtable identify concern woman business owner lack business assistance program exist small business scarcity financial resource startup expansion limited opportunity contract need specific research women business ownership addition hear concern advocate sunset center successful provide assistance woman walk lifethose receive public assistance operate business create job woman transition employee small business employer establish_womenbusiness owner create manufacture product sale home nurture woman entrepreneur business financial planning help critical issue secure funding startup expansion success funding question plague program add information gain official activity staff conduct review fund sponsor activity woman entrepreneur hold discussion woman business leader obtain information process prepare reauthorization finding support specific change ensure accountable delivery program service base need impressive record strong support make program permanent provide streamline grant administration process improvement focus operation enhance mission ability serve woman entrepreneur bill introduce today design address issue improve program service deliver nation woman business owner key_element bill improvement provide direction consolidation integration exist program create offer opportunity woman entrepreneurial endeavor improve entrepreneurial environment woman seek assistance opportunity sponsor program key success bill integration internal_external program partnership provision bill timely response tlhe many concern woman business owner receive constituent country bill make permanent program exist eligible center woman depend experienced service small business longterm counseling small business education training prove great value community servo ensure program service continue available ensure woman entrepreneur stage business ownership get assistance need success business growth obtain achieve_goal establish costly new initiative build successful establish program improve delivery benefit current future woman entrepreneur continue work legislation reauthorize address agencys program look work colleague ensure provision bill include growth woman own business reach full potential ask_unanimous consent_text bill sectionbysection_analysis print_record.\n",108.0,daily,1,0

I rise today to join twenty of my Senate colleagues in introducing landmark legislation that will double the amount of ethanol used in motor fuel by 2012. The Fuels Security Act of 2005 establishes a renewable fuels standard program beginning with 4. billion gallons in 2006 and culminating in 8 billion gallons in 2012nearly a 40 percent increase from legislation that I first sponsored in 2003. The legislation creates a functioning and flexible market for ethanol produced from South Dakotas farmerowned plants. South Dakota has more farmerowned ethanol plants than any other State. and South Dakota producers deliver a greater percentage of corn for ethanol production than any neighboring State. Revising and strengthening the proposed RFS is important to South Dakota producers and our valueadded economy. In 2004. the domestic ethanol industry produced a record 3.4 billion gallons of ethanol and an additional 700 million gallons of capacity will be added in 2005. Because of the strong increase in ethanol production over the last few years it is necessary to revisit and revise the proposed RFS to more accurately reflect the growing market. Increasing the RFS schedule to 8 billion gallons in 2012 ensures market stability and encourages investment in ethanol plants and transportation infrastructure. Ethanol stands out as an agriculture sector that is resisting the move toward greater consolidation and concentration. The Fuels Security Act of 2005 goes a long way toward ensuring that farmers retain market power and will continue to play a leading role in renewable energy production. While adjusting the schedule to match growth is crucial. equally important is ensuring that the schedule and standard are not eroded by a permissive credit program or inconsistent and suspect waiver authority provisions. To that end. the Fuels Security Act of 2005 creates a oneyear credit program to provide flexibility to blenders without diluting the RFS requirement. An illdefined or openended credit program will cause investor\xa7. to .hedge against investing in new ethanol facilities as the guarantee of an increased baseline is weakened through multiyear credit trading language. Additionally. the bill includes an effective tool to ensure that after 2012. Americas renewable fuel market does not diminish and capacity and production match demand. The bill directs the Secretaries of Agriculture and Energy. as well as the Environmental Protection Agency to ensure the RFS schedule grows with the overall motor vehicle fuel pool after 2013. I am proud to stand with over a dozen agriculture. clean energy and renewable fuels organizations that support this legislation. Accordingly. I ask unanimous consent that a letter written by over a dozen agriculture and energy groups be printed in the RECORD at the conclusion of my remarks.\n',rise today join colleague introduce landmark legislation double amount ethanol use motor_fuel establish renewable_fuel standard program begin gallon culminate gallon percent increase legislation sponsor legislation create functioning flexible market ethanol produce farmerowne plant farmerowne_ethanol plant other producer deliver great percentage corn ethanol production neighboring strengthen propose important producer valueadde economy domestic ethanol industry produce record gallon_ethanol additional gallon capacity add strong increase ethanol production last few year necessary revisit revise propose reflect grow market increase schedule gallon ensure market stability encourage investment ethanol plant transportation infrastructure ethanol stand agriculture sector resist move great consolidation concentration go long way ensure farmer retain market power continue play lead role renewable_energy production adjust schedule match growth crucial important ensure schedule standard erode permissive credit program inconsistent suspect waiver authority provision end create oneyear credit program provide flexibility blender dilute requirement illdefined_openende credit program cause .hedge invest new ethanol facility guarantee increase baseline weaken multiyear credit trading language bill include effective tool ensure america renewable_fuel market diminish capacity production match demand bill direct ensure schedule grow overall motor_vehicle fuel pool proud stand dozen agriculture clean energy renewable_fuel organization support legislation ask_unanimous consent letter write dozen agriculture energy group print_record conclusion_remarks.\n,109.0,daily,0,1

I want to talk about the timing of the Judge Sotomayor nomination. I talked with the distinguished ranking member last week on this schedule. and I would note the concerns he raised. but I am announcing today that the Senate Judiciary Committee will hold the confirmation hearing on the nomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor to be Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court on July 13. I have talked and met with Senator SESSIONS. the committees ranking member. several times to discuss the scheduling of this hearing. I will continue to consult with Senator SESSIONS to ensure that we hold a fair hearing. We were able to work cooperatively to send a bipartisan questionnaire to Judge Sotomayor within one day of her designation by President Obama. Last week the committee received her response to that questionnaire. We also received other background information from the administration. as well as the official Presidential nomination. This is a reasonable schedule. It will be the middle of next month. It is in line with past experience. It will allow several more weeks for committee members to prepare for the hearingseveral more weeks than if I had held the hearing this monthand there is no reason to unduly delaythe consider ation of this wellqualified nominee. Judge Sotomayor deserves the opportunity to go before the public and speak of her record. especially as some have mischaracterized and misstated it. The only place she can speak of her record is in.a hearing. It is also a responsible schedule that serves the many interests involved. Of course. first and foremost is the American peoples stake. in a process that is fair and thorough but not needlessly prolonged. It serves the purpose of the institution of the Senate. where we need sufficient time to prepare for a confirmation hearing. We have a full legislative plate of additional pressing business in the weeks and months ahead that is of great importance to our constituents and to the Nation. Then. of course. it serves the need of the third branch of governMent. which depends on the other branches of government to fill court vacancies in our independent judiciary. It serves the needs of the President who has nominated Judge Sotomayor. And lest we forget. it serves the needs of the nominee herself. who as a judge will only be able to speak publicly about her record when the hearings are convened. This is an extremely important obligation that we as Members of the Senate take on. There are only 101 people who get a direct say in the nomination and confirmation ofa Justice of the Supreme Court. First and foremost. of course. the President of the United Statesand in this case. President Obama cbnsulted with numerous Senators. Republicans and Democrats alikeprior to making his nomination. Then once the nomination is. made.. 100 Members of the Senate have to stand in for 300 million Americans in deciding who will get that lifetime appointment. I. voted on every single current member of the Supreme Court. as well as some in the past. and I know how important an obligation that is. The Justice who takes Justice Souters place for the court session that convenes. October 5 also needs as much time as possible to hire law clerks. to set up an office. to find a place to live here in Washington. and to take part with the rest of the Court in the preparatory work that precedes the- formal start of the session on the first Monday in October. . I mention that because I have put together a schedule that tracks the process the Senate followed. by bipartisan agreement. in considering President Bushs nomination of John Roberts to the Supreme Court in 2005. At that time. I served as the ranking minority membet of the Judiciary Committee. I met with our Republican chairman. and we worked out a schedule which provided for Chief Justice Roberts hearing 48 days after he was .named by President Bush. I might say that the agreement on time was reached even before the committee received the answers to the bipartisan questionnaire. And while Justice Robertsthen Judge Robertshad not written as many opinions as Judge Sotomayor. he had beeh in a political policy position in Republican administrations for years before. and there were 75.000 pages of documents from that time. In fact. some arrived almost on the eve of the hearing itself. And. of course. that nomination replaced Justice OConnor. who was recognized as a pivotal vote on the Supreme Court. If something that significant required 48 days. and Republicans and Democrats agreed that was sufficient to prepare for that hearing. in accordance with our agreement on the initial schedule. certainly that is a precedent that says we have more than adequate time to prepare for the confirmation hearing for Judge Sotomayor. My initial proposal to Senator SESSIONS was that we begin the hearing on July 7. following the Senates return from the Fourth of July recess. I have deferred the start date to July 13 in an effort to accommodate our Republican members. With bipartisan cooperation. we should still be able to complete JudiciaryCommittee consideration of the nomination during the last week in July. and allow the Senate to consider the nomination during the first week in August. before the Senate recesses In selecting the date. I am trying to be fair to all concerned. I want to be fair to the nominee. allowing her the earliest possible opportunity to respond to attacks made about her character. It is not fair for critics to be calling her racistone even equating her with the head of the Ku KluxKlan. an outrageous comment. and both Republicans and Demiocrats have said it was outrageous--without allowing her the opportufity to speak to it. and she cant speak to it until she is in the hearing. I also want to conclude the process without unnecessary delay so that she might participate fully in the deliberations of the Supreme Court selecting cases and preparing for its new term. In his May 1 letter to President Obama. Justice Souter announced his resignation. effective ""when the Supreme Court rises for the summer recess this year."" which will happen later thi s month. Thereafter. the Supreme Court prepares for the next term. To participate fully in tite upcoming .deliberations. it would be helpful for his successor to be confirmed and able to take part in the selection of cases as well in preparing for their argument. I am merely following the timeline we followed with the Roberts nomination. The timeline for the Alito nomination provides no reason to delay the hearing for Judge Sotomayor. It presented a very different situation in many ways. For one thing. that nomination was made with no consultation by President Bush. By contrast. President Obama devoted several weeks to consultation with both Republicans and Democrats before making his selection. The Alito nomination was President Bushs third nomination to succeed Justice OConnor. It followed 4 months of intense effort by the Judiciary Committee. beginning with Justice OConnors announcement on July 1. And finally. the Christmas holidays helped account for the timing of those hearings. I do not believe Bastille Day requires us to delay the confirmation hearings for the first Hispanic nominated to the Supreme Court for an additional 6 weeks. Some may recall that Justice OConnors resignation in 2005 was contingent on the ""nomination and confirmation of [her] successor."" She continued to serve.on the Supreme Court when its new term began in October 2005. and until Justice Alito was confirmed at the end of January 2006. In addition. proceedings to fill that vacancy involved a more extended process. not only because Justice OConnor represented a pivotal vote on the Supreme Court on so many issues. but because President Bush first nominated John Roberts and then withdrew that nomination. then nominated Harriet Miers and withdrew her nomination when Republicans and conservatives revolted. and finally nominated Samuel Alito. The nomination of Judge Alito was the third Supreme Court nomination that the Senate was asked to consider. and followed the withdrawal of the Miers nomination by only 3 days. Given that sequence of events. and the then upcoming Christmas holiday. that hearing on the late October nomination of Samuel Alito was appropriately scheduled by the Republican Chairman to begin after the New Year. In addition. Judge Alito did not return his questionnaire until November 30. His hearing was held 40 days after his questionnaire was returned. which includes the Christmas and the holiday period. That is substantially equivalent to the 39 days between the time receipt of Judge Sotomayors questionnaire response and her hearing. Of course. in the case of the current nomination. Judge Sotomayor had been reported to be a leading candidate for the vacancy as soon as it arose on May 1. and her record was being studied from at least that time forward. The right wing. groups attacking her were doing so long before she was named by the President on May 26. and those attacks have intensified since her designation. I do not want to see this historic nomination of Sonia Sotomayor treated unfairly or less fairly than the Senate treated the nomination of John Roberts. In 2005. when President Bush made his first nomination to the Supreme Court. Senator McCONNELL. who was the majority whip. said the Senate should consider and confirm the nominations within 60 to 70 days. We worked hard to achieve that. The nomination of Judge Sotomayor should more easily be considered within that timeframe. Judge Sotomayor has been nominated to succeed Justice Souter. a likeminded. independent and fair Justice. not bound by ideology. but one who decided each case on its merits and in accordance with the rule of law. We have the added benefit of her career being one that includes her service on the judiciary for the past 17 years. Her judicial decisions are matters of the public record. Indeed. when my staff assembled her written opinions and offered them t the Republican staff. they declined. because they already had. them and were reviewing them. We have the benefit of her judicial record being public and well known to us. We have the benefit of her record having been a subject of review for the last month. since at least May 1. when she was mentioned as a leading candidate to succeed Justice Souter. We have the benefit of having considered and confirmed her twice before. first when nominated to- be a judge by a Republican President and then when elevated to the circuit court by a Democratic President. We have the benefit of not having to search through Presidential libraries for work papers of the nominee. By contrast. the 75.000 pages of work papers for John Roberts required extensive time and effort to retrieve them from Presidential libraries and to overcome claims of privilege. In fact. they were still being received just days before the hearing. To delay Judge Sotomayors hearing until September would double the amount of time that Republicans and Democrats agreed was adequate to prepare for Judge Roberts hearing. That would not be fair or appropriate. That would not be equal treatment. \x95 Unlike the late July nomination of John Roberts. this nomination of Judge Sotomayor by President Obama was announced in May. Unlike the resignation of Justice OConnor that was. not announced until July. the retirement of Justice Souter was made official on May 1. Given that the vacancy arose 2 months earlier. and the nomination was made after bipartisan consultation 2 months earlier. by following the Roberts roadmap. we should be able to complete the process 2 months earlier. We should be able to complete the entire process by the scheduled recess date of August 7. Of course. while the Roberts nomination was pending. Chief Justice Rehnquist passed away and President Bush decided to withdraw the initial nomination to be an Associate Justice. and proceeded to nominate John Roberts to succeed the Chief Justice. instead.-We did not insist that the process start over. rather. we continued to move forward. It was the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. with its destruction and toll in damage and human life. thatpushed the start of the hearings back 1 week. by bipartisan agreement. We were still able to complete Senate consideration and the Senate confirmed John Roberts to be the Chief Justice 72 days after he was initially designated to be an Associate Justice. We did this despite the fact his initial nomination was withdrawn and only shortly before his hearing he was renominated to serve as the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. And we did this despite the terrible aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. where everybodyRepublicans and Democrats alikeagreed that we should hold back a week on the hearings so we could all concentrate the Nations resources on Hurricane Katrina. So that required a weeks delay. If we followed the same schedule. 72 days after Judge Sotomayor was nominated to the Supreme Court would be. August 6and we will not have to lose 7 of those days to Hurricane Katrina. Her historic nomination should be treated as fairly as the nomination of John Roberts was treated by the Senate. Given the outrageous attacks on Judge Sotomayois character. I do not think it fair to delay her hearing. I cringed when I was told that. during the courtesy visit Judge Sotomayor paid to Senator MCCONNELL. reporters shouted questions about conservatives calling her a- racist. She had to sit there silently and could not respond. She deserves that opportunity as soon as possible. The hearing is the opportunity for all Senators on the Judiciary CGuminitee. both Republicans and Democrats. to ask questions. to raise concerns. and to evaluate the nominee. As Senator SESSIONS Saturday radio speech ably demonstrates. Republican Senators are already prepared to ask their questions. Last week. we were considering another judicial nomination at the meeting of the Judiciary Committee when Senator KYL suggested that he may oppose all of President Obamas nominees given what he views as the criteria President Obama is considering in -selecting them. Republicans have questioned whether her recognition that she brings her life experience with her. as all judges do. is somehow disqualifying. Our Republican colleagues have said they intend to ask her about her judicial philosophy. It doesnt take a month to prepare to ask these questions. In fact. most of them have already raised the questfons. They will surely be prepared to ask them more than a month from now. And during that month. we have a weeks vacation from the Senate. I intend to be using that weekwithout the interruption of committee hearings. without the interruption of votes. without the interruption of the regular Senate businessto prepare for the hearings. I would advise those Senators who feel they have to have extra time to forgo your vacation and spend that week preparing for the hearing. Holding Judge Sotomayors hearingon July 13 will. in effect. afford 10 weeks for them to have prepared. Because this is a historic nomination. I hope all Senators will cooperate. It is a schedule that I think is both fair and adequate -fair to the nominee. but also adequate for the Senate to prepare for the hearing and Senate consideration. There is no reason to indulge in needless and unreasonable delay. I say this is a historic nomination because it should unite and not divide the American people and the Senate. Hers is a distinctly American story. Whether you are from the south Bronx or the south side of Chicago or south Burlington. VT. the American dream inspires all of us. Her life story is the American dream. And so. I might add. is the journey of the President who nominated her. Some are simply spoiling for a fight. There have been too many unfair attacks. people unfairly calling her racist and bigoted. I know Sonia Sotomayor. and nothing could be further from the truth. These are some of the same people who vilify Justice Souter and Justice OConnor. Americans deserve better. There are others who have questioned her character and temperament. She deserves a fair hearing. not a trial by. attack and assaults upon her character. So lets proceed to give her that fair hearing without unnecessary delay. I am also disappointed that some have taken to suggesting that after 17 years as a Federal judge. including 11 as a member of the U.S. Court of Ap-. pealm lur the SecnVki.uiUJUU Sotomayor does not understand ""the. judges role."" I know her to be a restrained and thoughtful judge. She has reportedly agreed with judges appointed by Republican Presidents 95 percent of the time. Let us respect her achievements. her experience. and her understanding. Let no one demean this extraordinary woman or her understanding of the constitutional duties she has faithfully performed for the last 17 years. I urge all Senators to join with me to fulfill our constitutional duties with respect. I have said many times on the floor of this great body over. my 35 years here that as Senators we should be the conscience of the Nation. as we are called upon to be. There have been occasions when this SenateRepublicans and Democrats alikehas united and shown they can be the conscience of the Nation. I would say this is one Vime we should rise above partisanship and be that conscience. When I met with Judge Sotomayor. I asked her about her approach to the law. She answered that. of course. ones life experience shapes who you are. but ultimately and completelyher wordsas a judge. you follow the law. There is not one law for one race or another. There is not one law for one color or another. There is not one law for rich. a different one for poor. There is not one law for those who belong to one political party or another. There is one law for all Americans. And she made it very emphatic that as a judge. you follow that one law. There is only one- law. We all know that. She said. ultimately and completely a judge has to follow the law. no matter what their upbringing has been. That is the kind of fair and impartial judging that the American people expect. That is respect for the rule of law. That is the kind of judge she has been. The purpose of the hearing is to allow Senators to ask questions and raise their concerns. It is also the time the American people can see the nominee. consider her temperament and evaluate her character. too. I am disappointed that some Republican Senators have declared that they will vote no on this historic nomination and have made that announcement before giving the nominee a fair chance to be heard at her hearing. It is incumbent on us to allow the nominee an opportunity to be considered fairly and allow her to respond to false criticism of her record and her character. Those who are critical and have doubts should support the promptest possible hearing. That is where questions can be asked and answered. That is why we hold hearings. Judge Sotomayor is extraordinarily. well equipped to serve on the Nations highest court. To borrow the phrase that the First Lady used last week. not only do I believe that Judge Sotomayor is prepared to serve all Americans on the Supreme Court. I believe the country is more than ready to see.this accomplished Hispanic woman do just that. This is a historic nomination. and it is an occasion for the Senate and our great Nation to come together. This is the time for us to come together. The process is another step toward the American people regaining confidence in their judiciary. Our independent judiciary is considered to be the envy of the world. Though less visible than the other two branches. the judiciary is a vital part of the infrastructure that knits our Nation together under the rule of law. Every time I walk up the steps into the SupremeCourt. I look at the words over the entrance to the Supreme Court. They are engraved in marble from my native State of Vermont. Those words say: ""Equal Justice Under Law."" The nomination of Judge Sotomayor keeps faith with that model. Her experience as a trial court judge will be important. Only Justice Souter of those currently on the Supreme Court previously served as a trial court judge. Judge Sotomayor has the added benefit of having been in law enforcement as a tough prosecutor who received her early training in the office of the longtime and storied New York District Attorney. Robert Morgenthau. I appreciate that she has shown restraint as a judge. We do not need another Supreme Court Justice intent on secondguessing Congress. undercutting laws passed to benefit Americans and protect their liberties. and making light of judicial precedent. President Obama handled the selection process with the care that the American people expect and deserve. and met with Senators from both sides of the aisle. Senator SESSIONS suggested to the President that it was important to nominate someone with a judicial record. Judge Sotomayor has more judicial experience than any nominee in recent history. I wanted someone outside the judicial monastery. and whose experiences were not limited to those in the rarified air of the Federal appellate courts. Her background as someone who was largely raised by a working mother in the South Bronx. who has never forgotten where she came from. means a great deal to me. Judge Sotomayor has a firstrate legal mind and impeccable credentials. I think she combines the best of what Senator SESSIONS and I recommended that the President look for in his nominee. The Supreme Courts decisions have a fundamental impact on Americans everyday lives. One need look no further than the Lilly Ledbetter and Diana Levine cases to understand how just one vote can determine the Courts decision and impact the lives and freedoms of countless Americans. I believe Judge Sotomayor will continue to. do what she has always done as a judgeapplying the law tothe case before her. I. do not believe she will act in the mold of conservative activists who secondguess Congress and undercut laws meant to protect Americans from discrimination in their jobs and in voting. to protect the access of Americans to health care and education. and to protect -their privacy from an overreaching government. I believe Judge Sotomayor understands that the courthouse doors must be as open to ordinary Americans as they are to government and big corporations. President Obama is to be commended for having consulted with Senators from both sides of the aisle. I was with him on some of the occasions that he did. I have had Senators come up to me. Republican Senators. and tell me they had never been called by a President of their own party. to say nothing of a Democratic President. to talk about a Supreme Court nominee. But President Obama did call and reach out. Now it is the Senates duty to come to the fore. I believe all Senators. of both parties. will work with me to consider this nomination in a fair and timely manner. I yield the floor and suggest. the absence of a quorum.\n'",sake colleague want talk timing nomination talk distinguished ranking member last week schedule note concern raise announce today hold

I desire to call the attention of the Snate at this time to the problem of the proposed revision of the Italian peace treaty. This in my judgment is a most important problem from the point of view of the solidarity of the free world and the need to have all free nations stand as equal partners in defense of their common heritage. It is regrettable that so many other pressing matters confronting the Senate have made it impossible up to this time for us to concentrate our attention on this matter. The visit to the United States of Premier de Gasperi. who made a notable address before a joint session of Congress on Monday. makes it particularly timely for us to consider the peacetreaty question. I hope very much that Premier de Gasperis visit will result in hastening the day when Italy will be free of the burdens and inequalities of the present treaty. Recently I received a copy of a resolution adopted on the 9th of September by the grand lodge of New Jersey.

I thank the gentleman for his understanding of the realities of both the budget and the need to appropriate based on public policy purposes only. I would also note that there is a long process left to go. and when the conference report comes back. it would be my hope. and. I believe. the hope of this body that it would come back in as clean a form as It was when we sent it over. if not cleaner. because I think It does not do this body good service to be debating on the House floor special interest projects that only go to a particular project or a particular recipient because of whom they know. I would note on two other matters that I would also hope we would take a harder look at some of the prioritizing in this committee report or in this legislation. and specifically I refer to a home ownership program called Urban Homestead. In which lowIncome families are given the opportunity to purchase a singlefamily home. The HUD appropriation bill before us erroneously reduces the program to $15 million while increasing other programs that I think do a lot less good for lowincome families. I would bring to the attention of the Members the fact that I think It would do a lot more benefit to lowincome families to increase the amount of urban homestead money in this bill from $15 million to a minimum of $50 to $75 million. Second. I would note that the preservation section that Is appropriated for $450 million to attempt to preserve a subsidized unit appears to be the appropriate amount of money. that Is. the total of $450 million. I say that as a member of the authorizing committee. But I would also note that the authorizing committee is completely redoing the authorization for preservation. We would expect to have that on the House floor sometime during the month of July. and I would very much hope that the appropriators would pay careful attention to our new authorization and take the same amount of money approximatately and to make the appropriations fit the new authorizations. The authorization may not be completed by both bodies and signed into law by the time the appropriations bill is finally passed. I would Just urge the appropriators. though. to take into account the changing authorization and to make the appropriate amount apply to whatever we end up with.\n',thank gentleman understanding reality budget need appropriate base public policy purpose note long process leave go conference report come hope believe hope body come clean form send clean think body good service debate floor special interest project go particular project particular recipient know note other matter hope take hard look prioritizing committee report legislation refer home ownership program call lowincome family give opportunity purchase home appropriation bill reduce program increase other program think lot good lowincome family bring attention member fact think lot more benefit lowincome family increase amount urban homestead money bill minimum note preservation section appropriate attempt preserve subsidized unit appear appropriate amount money total say member authorize committee note authorize committee redo authorization preservation expect floor month hope appropriator pay careful attention new authorization take same amount money make appropriation fit new authorization authorization complete body sign law time appropriation bill pass urge appropriator take account change authorization make appropriate amount apply end with.\n,101.0,daily,1,0

I was highly pleased to note that in passing the 1969 appropriation act for the Department of Agriculture the House of Representatives provided funds to continue these conservation programs at the operating levels approved by Congress for fiscal year 1968. Specifically. funds were restored for the small watershed program and for the agricultural conservation program. On March 20. I had the privilege of testifying before the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Department of Agriculture and related agencies appropriations. I proposed that Congress restore funds for these activities. I therefore recommend today that the Senate concur in the House action in providing funds for these conservation programs. However. the House did not correct one major deficiency in this appropriation act. The proposed appropriation act does not provide funds for the Soil Conservation Service to provide technical assistance to new soil and water conservation districts to be organized in 1969. Nor does it provide funds to pay for most of the increased cost of technical assistance to conservation districts resulting from the pay raises voted government employees by the Congress last year. Mr. President. Missouri was slow in launching Its conservation district program. But thanks to many local leaders. we have been making up for lost time in recent years. Missouri districts have more than doubled in number during the last 7 years. We have grown from 37 districts to 81 during this period. Twelve of these were organized In 1967. It is expected that eight more districts will be organized in Missouri in 1969. The point here is this. In each of the past 7 years the Congress has appropriated funds to provide technical staff for these new conservation districts. For 1969. however. there has been a change There are no funds proposed for this purpose in the 1969 budget estimate. There are no funds proposed for this purpose in the bill which was passed by the House of Representatives. I urge the Senate to provide funds in the 1969 appropriation act to staff new conservation districts to be organized during 1969. Missouris conservation district programs have strengthened the economy. improved agriculture. retarded erosion and pollution. cut back on water waste and floods. enhanced recreation. served the public interest in other ways. and have more than paid their way in terms of cost benefits. The same thing is true in conservation districts in all States throughout the Nation. I urge the Senate to provide funds in the 1969 Appropriation Act to finance the pay raise for SCS scientists and technicians which the Congress voted last year. The Appropriation Act as passed by the House provides $115 million for conservation operations. I urge the Senate to appropriate $130 million for conservation operations for fiscal year 1969.\n',aware extent opposition nation propose reduction various conservation program pleased note pass appropriation act provide fund continue conservation program operate level approve fiscal year fund restore small watershed program agricultural conservation program privilege testify related agency appropriation propose restore fund activity recommend today concur action provide fund conservation program correct major deficiency appropriation act propose appropriation act provide fund provide technical_assistance new soil water conservation district organize provide fund pay most increase cost technical_assistance conservation district result pay raise vote government employee last year slow launch conservation district program thank many local leader make lose time recent year district double number last year grow district period organize expect more district organize point past year appropriate fund provide technical staff new conservation district change fund propose purpose budget estimate fund propose purpose bill pass urge provide fund appropriation act staff new conservation district organize conservation district program strengthen economy improve agriculture retarded erosion pollution cut water waste flood enhance recreation serve public interest other way more pay way term cost benefit same thing true conservation district nation urge provide fund finance pay raise scientist_technician vote last year pass provide conservation operation urge appropriate conservation operation fiscal year,90.0,bound,0,1

He did say In 8 State. they are qualified and are licensed to practice the same as are doctors of medicine and that in 30 States they are licensed to practice major surgery. Certainly. we are not trying to give the veterans something they should not have or force anything on them. The American Legion. the Disabled American Veterans. the Veterans of Foreign Wars. and all the other veterans organizations I know of. have gone on record in their national conventions in favor of giving the Administrator of Veterans Affairs authority to hire these people when qualified. General Bradley and General Hawley are in favor of this bill. Naturally. they do not like everything in it. I do not either. But certainly we have no ground for adhering to their argument that we should not involve them in a jurisdictional dispute. This is a veterans bill. This is not a bill for doctors of medicine or doctors of osteopathy or the bureaucrats in the Veterans Administration. Certainly osteopaths cannot be hired at the present time. This law will authorize the Administrator of Veterans Affairs to hire them. It provides in sections 5 (b) and 6 that the Administrator shall set up the qualifications they must have. You can be sure General Bradley is not going to put any quacks in his medical service. What he needs is qualified doctors. regardless of what kind of college degree they hold. He cannot get them unless we give him the power. It has been charged that it would create confusion to use more than one kind of doctor in veterans hospitals. Experience indicates otherwise. This is not an untried. Government policy. There was no confusion between the doctors of medicine and the doctors of osteopathy during this war in the Army and Navy hospitals. There has been no confusion from the United States Employment Compensation Act. under which the civilservice employees are given the right to use doctors of osteopathy. There was no confusion during this war when legislation which every one of you voted for enabled doctors of osteopathy to be paid out of the Treasury of the United States to deliver the babies of our veterans. What is good for the serviceman should be good for him when he takes off his uniform and becomes a veteran. All of you voted to enable him to study osteopathy at Government expense under the GI bill of rights last year. Let us be consistent. This bill is permissive in character. It does not force the Veterans Administration to hire osteopaths. It does give them the power and safeguards it by providing that the Administration shall determine their qualifications. When they admit they cannot get enough doctors of medicine and then oppose tapping a huge reservoir of medical talent to whose qualifications they do not object. such action does not appeal to rensonable men interested in the welfare of the veteran and I am sure will not appeal to Congress. I am not against doctors of medicine. I prefer them personally. But I am not prepared to say a veteran cannot have an osteopath when needed and preferred by him. Are you? It is pure poppycock to say doctors of medicine would not enter a veterans hospital using doctors of osteopathy. The doctors of medicine will not boycott our disabled veterans. General Hawley testified that they worked together in Army hospitals. Together they have written a glorious page in American medical and surgical history.

I should like to compliment the gentleman from Kansas on his outstanding statement. I think that he has put his finger on the great value of the Federal land bank system. We know that the Federal land bank has been extraordinarily important. not only to the States of the Midwest but also to California. In view of the importance of agriculture in Imperial and Riverside Counties of California. it is appropriate that an appraisal of the impact of the land bank loans in this area. which is my district. be included in these deliberations. The Imperial Valley is doubtless one of the most widely known agricultural areas in the world. Blessed with a mild winter and enjoying a superheated summer. quite often our land is doublecroppedwe take two harvests in 1 year. Our soils are deep and generally fertile. Since the late 1930s when Hoover Dam was completed. we have been free from the devastating floods. which repeatedly wreaked havoc in the valley prior to control of the Colorado River. To create a successful agriculture takes more than natural resourcestwo other ingredients are essential. Our area has attracted a group of men who have persisted in their efforts to wrest a living from the soil. They have solved the problems of drainage. of producing crops in the heat of a blistering summer. an. of transporting their products to markets thousands of miles from the area of production. One other ingredient is essential: Capital. Within my district the Federal land bank associations of El Centro and Riverside and the Federal Land Bank of Berkeley have carried forward constructive lending services which have been of great assistance to our farmers and ranchers. Without resorting to a compendium of figures. suffice it to say that in the Imperial. Coachella. and Palo Verde valleys and in the Riverside area there are approximately $40 million outstanding in longterm land bank loan. This approaches onetenth of the total amount of the Berkeley land banks outstanding loans in its fiveState area of Arizona. California. Hawaii. Nevada. and Utah. Citing this impressive figure of loans outstanding at the present time does not take into account the millions which have been loaned and repaid since bank loans were first made in my district. Making longterm farm real estate loans in my district is not an easy assignment. We are producers of many different cropssome highly specialized. dates. for examplewhich require special consideration. We have witnessed dramatic changes in our agriculture: the increasing size of our producing units. the development of extreme specialization. and the application of science to our production problems. We have witnessed changes in market requirements and the ebb and flow of great agricultural industries as the increasing population of southern California creates concentrations of people undreamed of 20 years ago. Specifically. the Berkeley Land Bank and its affiliated land bank associations have participated us the financing of poultry plansfrom the small. modest flock to the supersized unit with the number of laying hens in the hundreds of thousands. Land bank loans have been an important factor in the financing of the citrus industry. for in spite of the pressures of urbanization. my district is still an important citrusproducing area. Within our area. in keeping with the changes in production and marketing. we have developed large and important cattlefeeding operations. the feed for which comes from thousands of acres of land developed and purchased with land bank financing. It is important to all of us that the flexibility built into land bank loans has resulted in the financing of specialty crops. It is important too that these loans provide substantial financing for what might be termed the basic elements of a comprehensive agriculture: alfalfa. milk. and meat. In this brief statement there are two more important ideas which should be recognized. All sections of the country have been involved in the continuing increases in the value of farmland. In some instances. farmlands have changed hands at prices which appear to be higher than a value which can be sustained from agricultural production. Over the years land values on which land bank loans are based have been increased rather substantially in my district. However. the loans are still made as they should be. that is. on an agricultural value which can be sustained by the production from the land. I agree that longterm agricultural loans should be made on such a basis. To lend a farmer more money than he can repay is committing a disservice. To presume that credit can be substituted for income is fallacious reasoning. Land bank loans stand for sound agricultural financing. Within the area in California south of the Tehachapi Mountains. the area usually referred to as southern California. there now reside about half the people of the State. about 10 million people who are supplied with an abundance of food through the miracle of modern American merchandisingthe supermarket. The perishable products. for example. milk and eggs. flow in an orderly manner to these people from the agricultural areas in close proximity to the mass of consumers. We recognize that for many years land bank loans have provided substantial financial assistance to the farmers and ranchers who have used them. However. the secondary beneficiaries of land bank financing are the consumers who have enjoyed the products flowing every month of the year from the farms and ranches which supply the food for an everincreasing population. The bounty on the tables of the American people. regardless of where they live. is a credit to our agricultural industry. It is appropriate that we take note of the part of El Centro and Riverside Land Bank Associations and the Berkeley Land Bank have played in the underwriting of an agriculture which has provided so much of the abundance for the best fed nation in the world. We can appraise them with the simple but sincere commendation.""Well done.""\n'",like compliment gentleman outstanding statement think put finger great value land bank system know land bank important view importance agriculture appropriate appraisal impact land bank loan area district include deliberation doubtless know agricultural area world bless mild_winter enjoy superheated summer land take harvest year soil deep fertile late 1930 complete free devastating flood wreak_havoc valley control create successful agriculture take more natural_resourcestwo other ingredient essential area attract group man persist effort wrest living soil solve problem drainage produce crop heat blistering_summer transport product market thousand mile area production other ingredient essential district land bank association carry constructive lending service great assistance farmer_rancher resort compendium figure suffice say valley area outstanding longterm bank loan approach onetenth total amount land bank outstanding loan area cite impressive figure loan outstanding present time take account million loan repay bank loan make district make longterm farm real_estate loan district easy assignment producer many different cropssome specialize date examplewhich require special consideration witness dramatic change agriculture increase size produce unit development extreme specialization application science production problem witness change market requirement ebb_flow great agricultural industry increase population southern create concentration people undreame year affiliated land bank association participate financing poultry small modest flock supersize unit number lay_hen hundred_thousand land bank loan important factor financing citrus industry spite pressure urbanization district important citrusproduce area area keep change production marketing develop large important cattlefeede_operation feed come thousand acre land develop purchase land bank financing important flexibility build land bank loan result financing specialty_crop important loan provide substantial financing term basic element comprehensive agriculture alfalfa milk meat brief statement important idea recognize section country involve continue increase value farmland instance farmland change hand price appear high value sustain agricultural production year land value land bank loan base increase district loan make agricultural value sustain production land agree longterm agricultural loan make basis lend farmer more money repay commit disservice presume credit substitute income fallacious_reasoning land bank loan stand sound agricultural financing area area refer southern reside people people supply abundance food miracle_modern american merchandisingthe supermarket perishable product example milk egg flow orderly manner people agricultural area close_proximity mass consumer recognize many year land bank loan provide substantial financial assistance farmer_rancher use secondary beneficiary land bank financing consumer enjoy product flow month year farm_ranch supply food everincreasing population bounty table american people live credit agricultural industry appropriate take note part play underwriting agriculture provide much abundance good feed nation world appraise simple sincere commendation do,90.0,bound,0,1

I would like to join my colleagues in expressing my thoughts about both of our lost colleagues. the Senator from Pennsylvania and the Senator from Texas. In the all too often busy and hectic life of public service. the life that we bring upon ourselves here in the Congress. Important words are regrettably often left unsaid. unsaid until a tragedy. brings to us the realismnot just the sadness. but the realismof what each of us individually and collectively loses when we experience the loss of. our colleagues. It is those events that often prompt the praise of fellow Senators. the heartfelt expressions such as we have heard today. But these sentiments are real. and they are true and they are spoken from the heart. I was privileged to be among those Senators who joined the family of Senator Heinz in Pittsburgh and witnessed one of the most magnificent yet simple ceremonies on behalf of a fallen comrade. I say fallen because we lost John Heinz in what I call the line of duty. He was working to the very minute he departed. He was a man of courage and strength. intellectually and physically. and there was no reason to believe other than he would be with us for many. many. many years to come. And yet the tragedy of an air accident took him so quickly. leaving in the prime of her life a widow and three sons. each of whom is trying to reach out and achieve goals his father would be proud of. I hope all of us in the days and months and years to come will do what we can individually to provide not only comfort and security but love and affection for his widow. and such guidance as his sons may accept. I go back to the year I Joined the Senate in 1979. coming with just a basic familiarity of the complex and often arcane customs of this institution. My then wife and I had the good fortune of receiving the big brother and big sister treatment from Senator and Mrs. Heinz. They helped us in so many ways to become indoctrinated to the Senate. not only the formalities of this institution but equally. if not more importantly. the informalities. We have our Senate rules. We have our precedents. The Parliamentarian Is always available to give us such opinions as we may or may not wish to receive. But there is much that is not in the rules and the precedents. There are personal relationships here in this Chamber. personal relationships that must be fostered outside this Chamber. John and Teresa were very special to me and my family. At that time we were assigned to different committees and followed separate paths with respect to our special responsibilities in the Senate. But I shall always be grateful for the kindness and the thoughtfulness of my good friend. the senior Senator from Pennsylvania. He made the path I was to follow in these nearly 13 years clearer. and left the markers which I will continue to follow in the future. Senator Heinz provided the leadership to produce results not only for his State but for the Nation. Just one little reminder. the Washington subway system. It did not touch Pennsylvania. I am sure in Pennsylvania there are cities that would love to have a subway system comparable to our Metro. but it was John Heinz who led the fight here in the U.S. Senate to get the funding and the authorization. and to work with the Senators from Virginia and Maryland to achieve a goal that we had been striving to achieve in a decade. to complete the 103mile system. It was not in his State. But he had a deep Interest and he expressed that deep interest about the Nations Capital many times to those of us who bear some unique responsibility to the Nations Capital for our legislative responsibilties. We thank you. John. I thank you on behalf of not only Virginians. but all of those here in the metropolitan area. Tragedy often forces men to face their own mortality. All of us in the Senate lead lives that keep us on the road and in the air. The tragedy. the death of my friend. John Heinz. does not compel me to shrink from the challenges of public life. Rather. the triumphs and achievements of his life inspire me to hopefully do more in such time that remains for me to serve in this institution. It is my sincere hope for the family and the friends of Senator Heinz and for all who admire him. as I did. that the pain of his passing will dim far more quickly than will the remembrance of his distinguished career. I shall always remember him in one unique way. He never strode upon this floor that he was not tall in thought and in body. and clutching beneath his arm that bundle of papers. He was truly one of the hardest working Members of the U.S. Senate. and it inspires us all. Mr. President. I turn to our second distinguished colleague who also was lost in the line of duty. John Tower would want to have it that way because he was a vigorous man. vigorous in mind and thought in the pursuit of the goals that were important to him. He was on his way to share his knowledge. knowledge that he had gained through many. many years of hard work. beginning with a career in the U.S. Navy in World War II. I remember so well when I was serving in the secretariat In the Department of the Navy. He did not ask me to come to his office. He summoned me to come to his office. and to bring with me the Chief of Naval Operations. At that time. if my memory serves me correctly. Admiral Zumwalt had just succeeded Admiral Moore. We had some hint as to the subject matter of the visit. but we were not sure until we arrived. And there. in his office. we performed a promotional ceremony. John Tower had been an enlisted man in the U.S. Navy. John Tower was very proud of the fact that he was a boatswains mate. For those who know something of the Navy. the boatswain is the man aboard the ship that probably has the greatest store of general knowledge of the officers and the men of the ship. and of all aspect of handling the ship. On the whole. they were a rough and ready lot. But their knowledge of that ship was second to none. even the captain. John was particularly proud that he had risen through all enlisted ranks to that of chief boatswains mate. At roughly 10 or 11 oclock in the morning. at a brief ceremony. he was promoted to the highest of all ranks. chief boatswain. The loss of John also brought us the knowledge of the loss of one of his daughters. I had the opportunity on many happy occasions to share an evening with those lovely daughters: Very beautiful. very knowledgeable. and above all. loving to their father. As time progressed in this institution. Johns ability to teach became very apparent to me. Yes. he was a Senator and eventually chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. I think that alone was his secret lifes ambition. never to be paralleled by any future position in life. But John always had the patience. always found the time to listen and to convey his knowledge on a subject. And his knowledge on matters of national security. intelligence. and on the relationship between the executive branch and the legislative branch of our Government was second to none. Time and time again. when we were caught up in this institution particularly in relation to the War Powers Act. another subject that he knew well. the question as to the Presidents authority to send our troops abroad to protect the security interests of this Nation and the security interests of our allies and friends. I and others would refer to that landmark article that he wrote describing that relationship. and how he said to the Members of the U.S. Congress. all who aspire from time to time to be Secretary of State. that how but one man. the President of the United States. can represent this Nation in its relationships with other governments. because we the Congress. collectively and individually. simply cannot do that. even though from time to time we strive to do so. That article I urge to be studied and read by all. I use it. and will continue to use it. time and time again. It represents to me but one of the many lessons learned from that master. John Tower. He used to sit right there in the United States Senate. I remember so well the night in this institution we finally grappled with the decision as to whether or not we should express our views as being consistent with the views of the Prime Minister of England in the Falklands war. and John went up and down that aisle and recounted in detail the history between our country and Great Britain. He had a special affection for Great Britain. I doubt if anyone. certainly not in the lifetime I have been here in the Senate. had a better knowledge about the relationship between the United States and Great Britain that John Tower. I hope the people of Great Britian know that they lost in John Tower one of their strongest proponents ever to be a Member of the U.S. Senate. John and I had our differences. but he was a man that would be always willing to bridge those differences. My greatest loss with the passing of John Tower is that. with time. perhaps we could have reconciled and closed some of the differences we had. That will be a loss that I will have to bear. At any rate. on balance. as I look back over our association of nearly a decade in this institution. I was the one that profited the most. I say to you. John. and to the members of your family. I thank you. As an old sailor said. ""May fair winds and flowing seas always nourish in the hearts that you left behind the warmest of thoughts."" Mr. President.

1130071138,H,20140116,135,Mr. WILSON of South Carolina,Unknown,WILSON,South Carolina,M,5481,5591,01162014.txt,4156,271,113121740,WILSON,JOE,H,SC,M,R,2.0,voting,"Mr. Speaker. I rise to voice my concern about the proposed size of our Army. Our active Army should not be reduced to 420.000 personnel and our National Guard to 315.000 personnel as this represents a substantial risk to our national security policy. Within the Army. I am concerned about the restructuring of the Army Aviation force. This restructuring would represent a significant policy shift away from the Armys. ""Total Force Policy."" It would also negatively impact Army National Guard aviation and the communities in which those units are based. I fully understand that sequestration has caused the Army to make some very difficult decisions about their future force structure. I do not want to see a repeat of the 1990s when the active and reserve components fought one another for the limited resources available. However. that seems to be the path we are on and it in no way advances our national security. That is why. I begin by asking and imploring my colleagues in the House of Representatives to work together to find a solution to sequestration and repeal this misguided method of reducing spending. It is our Constitutional duty to provide for the common defense and we should not be reducing spending by placing half of the cuts on the back of the Department of Defense when defense spending only represents 15.1 percent of the budget. Following the Vietnam War. former Chief of Staff of the Army. General Creighton Abrams devised the Total Force Policy. This policy vested much of the Armys reserve combat power in the hands of the Army National Guard. The Army National Guard was meant to be a ""mirror image."" of the active force to the extent possible and to provide strategic depth in times of conflict. Mirror imaging meant that the National Guard would be trained and fielded with the same equipment as the active Army and this proposed aviation restructuring veers away from the total force policy. There are those that say that Army National Guard aviation currently is not a mirror image of the active force because the structure of units is different. Providing a mirror image of brigade structure is not the point. the National Guard is not resourced or intended to follow the active duty Combat Aviation Brigade (CAB) structure. The mirror imaging is in smaller units such as battalions that permit the Army to have strategic depth in its forces so that in wartime. the active units do not have to bear the full brunt of the fight. Without the National Guard and strategic depth. these past 12 years of conflict in Afghanistan and Iraq would have broken our Army. Divesting the Army National Guard of the Apache helicopter is a mistake. The active Army will have all of its attack and scout aviation power in the active force with no strategic depth and no reserve relief available if we find ourselves engaged in another major conflict. Enormous amounts of training dollars will be wasted. Years of aviation and combat experience will have been squandered. Our National Guard Apache pilots are amongst the finest in the world. In my home state of South Carolina. the 1st of the 151st (1151) attack reconnaissance battalion is one of the best attack battalions in the Army. There operational tempo is not as high as the active Army and it gives them a chance to train on critical skills that active duty simply does not have time for with the fight ongoing in Afghanistan. The 1151st recently began to train its pilots on how to land an Apache on a Navy ship. Prior to these pilots becoming qualified. the Army did not have one single Apache pilot currently qualified to perform deck landings. Now however. the pilots of the 1151 are helping to train the rest of the Army on this difficult and important task. In closing. the battle we have is with sequestration. The active and reserve components should not be fighting one another. we in Congress should be providing them the necessary resources they require. We need to resource the Army at a level that protects our national security and keeps our personnel levels at the necessary levels. and keeps our equipment in the reserve and active components modernized and ready.\n'",rise voice concern propose size active reduce personnel personnel represent substantial risk national security policy concerned restructuring force restructuring represent significant policy shift impact aviation community unit base understand sequestration cause make difficult decision future force structure want see repeat 1990 active reserve component fight limited resource available seem path way advance national security begin ask implore colleague work find solution sequestration repeal misguided method reduce spending constitutional duty provide common defense reduce spending place half cut back defense spending represent percent budget follow former devise policy vest much reserve combat power hand mean mirror_image active force extent possible provide strategic depth time conflict mirror_imaging mean train field same equipment active propose aviation restructure veer total force policy say aviation mirror_image active force structure unit different provide mirror_image brigade structure point resource intend follow active duty structure mirror_imaging small unit such battalion permit strategic depth force wartime active unit bear full brunt fight strategic depth past year conflict break divest helicopter mistake active attack scout aviation power active force strategic depth reserve relief available find engage major conflict enormous amount training dollar waste year aviation combat experience squander pilot fine world home state 1st 151st attack reconnaissance battalion good attack battalion operational_tempo high active give chance train critical skill active duty time fight ongoing 1151st begin train pilot land ship pilot become qualified single pilot qualified perform deck landing pilot help train rest difficult important task closing battle sequestration active reserve component fight provide necessary resource require need resource level protect national security keep personnel level necessary level keep equipment reserve active component modernize ready.\n,113.0,daily,1,0

What the gentleman said. and he is absolutely correct. if we leave that $1 here in Washington. DC. it will not go for reducing the national debt. it will go for new programs and for new spending. When we leave money around here. the new spending Is a temptation. I am sure the gentleman knows this. at least as It applies to me. when I have people come into my office asking for new spending. these usually are not bad programs. They usually sound great. E0 2200 But the question is. can we afford them? So the temptation to spend those dollars will fall on Republicans and Democrats back here. It is a strong temptation. We have a lot of our constituents out there who. If that dollar stays here. they say the dollar is going to stay in Washington. let us spend it .for this program or let us spend it for that program. We all know that if we leave that dollar here it will grow the size of the Government. What the Republicans are pushing for. and we are having a tough time getting our message across because it is very easy to spend it in 15 seconds. what the gentleman from the Dakotas and myself are trying to explain in 30 minutes. but the fact is if we leave that dollar in your pocket. In your community. it would work much better. The only way that theory would not work is if when keeping that dollar in your community. in your pocket. you went out and buried it in the ground. literally put it in the ground other than it is either going to a bank. which will loan It back out to the community. it is going to be spent for goods and services. which circulate in the community. Do -my colleagues know what they should do? Sometimes some of these companies have to pay taxes. They should pay their employees in $2 bills. we still have a $2 bill out there. pay in $2 bills and see how often and how many places those $2 bills show up in your community and how many weeks those $2 bills are showing up in stores and all kinds of different places in your community versus coming back here to Washington. I hope the gentleman stays. I want to point out a couple of other things on taxes we have just gotten from the Tax Foundation. and the Tax Foundation has a lot of credibility back here. It is a nonpartisan organization. We have just received in 1999 what Americans per capita will spend on things such as food. clothing. and shelter. I want to show my colleagues some very stunning numbers. I will write them here very quickly for you. On food in 1999. $2.693. That is what the average per capita expenditure in the United States will be for food. For clothes. that will be $1.404. So for food per capita. we are going to spend $2.693. For clothes. we are going to spend $1.404. And for shelter. we will spend $5.833. Now. if we add that up. assuming my math is right. that is $9.930 per capita. So food is $2.693. Clothes are $1.404. And shelter is $5.833. That is what you spend for those priority items in your family. Guess what you will pay for taxes? $10.298. In other words. the per capita expenditure per family in this country you will pay more for taxes than you do for your food. your clothes. and your shelter combined. Again. let me repeat that. We will all pay more in taxes than we will pay for our food. our clothes. and our shelter. Now. we will also. another interesting thing. when you look at these numbers put out by the tax group. on Federal taxes alone. we will spend more than any other major budget item. I want to put some examples out here. For housing. we will spend the $5.833. for health care. $3.829. for food. $2.693. for transportation. $2.568. for recreation. $1.922. for clothing. $1.404. For Federal taxes alone. just for Federal taxes. here is what we spend for Federal taxes: $7.000. So think about your budget. think about what you are spending in your family budget. These are roughly the figures that you will come up with: Housing $5.833. You spend more in taxes than you do in housing for your f6mily. Health care for your family. you will spend about $3.829. This is per capita. You will spend a little over twice that for taxes. not quite twice. $7.026. For food to feed the family. per capita. $2.693 compared to what kou are going to have to pay in taxes. $7.026. For recreation. $1.922 compared tothe $7.000 you are going to pay in taxes. For clothing. $1.404 to clothe your family per capita. and you are going to spend over $7.000 in taxes. My point is this: There has been a lot of rhetoric lately about if we do not provide some kind of tax relief for the American people then we hear from the Democratic party leadership that the Federal debt will only increase and they all of a sudden. the Democrat leadership. after 40 years of running deficits in this country. now. some of my colleagues do not like to hear partisanship and I am not trying to be partisan. but. the fact is the Republicans did not run this House for 40 years. they have run it for 5 years. and we have had surpluses on almost all of those years. We have had welfare reform. We had the tax cut I spoke about earlier. But the reality. what people do not want you to hear is that. guess what. when we reduce your taxes. when we allow you to keep those dollars in your pockets. guess what happens? The economy improves. Take a look at any major tax relief or tax reduction in this century or in the century before it but since income tax came in this century. take a look at -any one of them. Immediately after a tax reduction. the economy improved. When those dollars. again. unless you bury your dollars in the ground and you never see them again or you hide them and do not circulate them in your community. then in any other circumstance that will. one. keep down the size of government and. two. bring up the health of the economy. Now. we have got a pretty good economy. Not everybody. My good friend from the Dakotas talks about the agriculture and the suffering. and they are suffering out in the farm belt. But there are a lot of people who are enjoying the healthiest. many of them. they will ever experience in their entire life. So they do not worry so much about taxes. Well. you pay a little tax here. you pay a little tax here. Let me tell you what is happening while some of you are asleep. The governments. whether it is a local government. whether it is a local district. whether it is a State government. or whether it is the Federal Government. is sneaking into your house while you are asleep and those taxes are going up. Most of the increase that you have seen in your taxes. the total tax package. has occurred since 1981. Most of that increase. 45 percent. 45 percent of the taxes that you pay are as a result of tax increases since 1981. All we are saying here is let us not fall asleep while the tax man sneaks in behind us. Now. are taxes necessary? Of course they are necessary. We have certain responsibilities that belong to the Federal Government. a strong military. I think we have a fundamental obligation for good education in this country. We do have some health care obligations. We have transportation obligations for the interstate highways. interstate commerce. We have a justice system that has to be maintained. So there are some fundamental obligations that the Federal Government must maintain. There are certainly obligations that the State government must maintain. We agree with those. Our local districts. our school districts have a very heavy burden ir. providing what we want and that is quality education. Those dollars have to go in. But it does not mean we should overpay and it does not mean when we pay our tax we should not ask our elected officials. am I paying too much? Am I getting a fair shake for my dollar? Am I gettingefficient use out of that dollar? Is that dollar more productive in Washington. D.C.. or is it more productive in my home State of Santa Clara. California. or Salt Lake City. Utah. or Kansas City. Kansas. or Carbondale. Colorado? Is this where those dollars are most efficient? So. my colleagues. I am just trying to say to my colleagues here as this rhetoric goes on about the tax cut and how it is going to add to the Federal debt. take a look at the details. Read the fine print. When you read the fine print. you are going to find out. frankly. really there are two choices. One. continue to grow the Government or. two. give back a portion of the surplus. not all of the surplus. but give back a portion ofthe surplus to the people who earned it. Tax dollars are taxed to spend. That is the only reason we get taxed. It is the only reason our constituents out .there get taxed. The only reason you are being taxed is so that some governmental body can. spend that money. And as we said earlier. some of those expenses are justified. Some of them are necessary. But if you tend to allow accountability to become lax or the old saying that ""when the cat is away. the mice will play."" if you do not keep the cat in the barn. the mice pretty soon get out of control. What we are saying here is let us exercise prudent financial management and let us tell our. clients. the constituents. the taxpayers. you overpaid for this product. You deserve a little of it back. We still want to give you a fine product. You deserve it from the Government. But at this point you have overpaid a little. not a lot. The tax decrease we are talking about does not do a lot but it still keeps a few of those dollars in your pocket. I have had a recent opportunity about 3 years ago. and this is exciting regardless of what party you are in regardless of your bent toward partisan politics. I have got something that I hope all of my colleagues take a very careful look at. It has been a tremendously successful program in my district. and I would like to explain it to my colleagues. It is called the S.E.E.D.S. program. I actually started that program in the Third Congressional District of Colorado with the help of a lot of people Susan Smith. the City of Pueblo. County of Pueblo. several school districts. Pueblo Community College. Roger Gomez. a number of different people. We all got together. and we found out that under the Federal regulations. you can ask Federal agencies for their excess computer equipment. In other words. we have. for example. the Department of Energy who has been very cooperative with us. They have excess computer equipment. Some of this equipment is almost brand new. Now. this is not stateoftheart computer equipment. But most schools in our country do not have stateoftheart computer equipment. In fact. in my district there were a number of schools that did not have really any computer equipment. So what we did on our drive to cut down Government waste is we went to these different agencies and we said we would like you to ship those computers to a warehouse. which. by the way. was donated to our cause in Pueblo. Colorado. send them to our warehouse. We got students from Pueblo Community College to come in and help us put part A of the computer with part B. so on and so forth. We got citizens to help us haul away the trash. We got citizens to help come down and do the mechanical work. We got citizens to volunteer and come down and help us match up the computers with schools that needed these computers. And before you know it. our program was off and running. What were the results of our program? In our program in Colorado now. we are up to 200 sets of computers a week that we give to local schools. not just public school*. private schools. home schoolers. senior citizens. It is an exciting project. It provides a need for education which we think is very important. Nobody disagrees that education is not important. And it takes away budget waste. Government waste. wasteful spending. which I think most of us would agree is not necessary. We take that waste. and we convert it to a good. positive use. It is called the S.E.E.D.S. program. I am here this evening to tell my constituents. to tell my colleagues here on the House floor this is a program you should adopt. you should take a look at. I would like to cover another area tonight. There has been some recent press. publicity. about a stand I have taken in regards to our military academies. Let me precede my comments on the academies with the statement about the military. We need in this country the strongest military second to none in the world. Do not let people kid you. It would be a very terrible mistake for us to allow our military to fall into shambles and to become the second toughest kid on the block. You cannot be the second toughest kid on the block. You cannot be the third toughest kid on the block. You have got to be the toughest kid on the block. It does not mean you go pick fights. but it does mean you will be in less fights because people will not want to fight you. It also means that you can go out and help those people that are less fortunate -because of your strength. I believe in a strong military. and all of us should believe in a strong military. For too many years. the military has not received the kind of priority that is necessary. although the military for too many years has been called to different missions all over the world. I think right now we are stationed in 164 different locations. So I have great respect for the military. but I also believe that the military has accountability. I want to talk for a couple of minutes about our service academies. It is a great honor to be selected to go to the United States service academies. West Point. the Air Force Academy. the Naval Academy. the U.S. Coast Guard. The students that go there are not the cream of the crop. I repeat that. They are not the cream of the crop. They are the cream of the cream of the crop. We take our very best students. and when we focus in on the students that we want to send to those military academies. I think there are a lot of things we need to look at and list in order of priority. Leadership skills. obviously intelligence capabilities. and maybe somewhere on the list. further down on the list. there are sports abilities or their celebrity status on sports. Here is what is happening. This is my point that I disagreed very strongly with on some of the academies. When someone enters. say. the Air Force Academy. you make a commitment to the United States of America. You sign a deal with them. It is fully disclosed. There is nothing hidden about it. You tell the United States. in this case Air Force Academy. I will serve so many years in exchange for those 4 years of college education that the American people are giving me as a privilege. and it is a privilege. We pick great young men and women to be in the service. but you sign this commitment and just to be sure you fully understand that commitment. after 2 years of being in. say the U.S. Air Force Academy. we say to the students. look. you can walk away. no strings attached or we want you to make sure that you make an informed decision that if you continue at the Air Force Academy and complete your 4 years education. you will have a commitment of service. you will have an obligation. you will have a duty. These students. by the way. live under an ethical code or a military code or an academy code that says. service to the Nation over self. Well. what I have discovered is happening is. if you are in a very special class of people at the Air Force Academy. for example. you get treated differently than the other cadets. What am I talking about? If everyone was listening to me earlier this evening. I talked about heroes. We had two heroes in Grand Junction. Colorado. They lost. their lives. I like sports. I enjoy the Broncos. I am a fan of the Broncos. but even my favorite sports person. to me. is a celebrity. not a hero. But what happens at the academies. if you are a celebrity sports person. for example. an outstanding football player who has an opportunity to be drafted by the pros. you are going to get special treatment or some of them have received special treatment by the Air Force Academy. for example. that lets them walk away from their service commitment. Now. they have to serve some time in the reserves. but they are not treated like every other cadet out there. Now. some people say. well. it Is good publicity for us. It is necessary that we allow these academy graduates to walk away or be waivered. that is the keyword. that is the buzz word. be waivered from their duty and their service so that we get publicity in the pro football circuit. My comment to that was. well. if we need publicity. why do we not just go ahead and let United Airlines. for example. or any airline. I fly United a lot. let any airline go to the Air Force Academy and say we would like your top pilots. go ahead and waive their service. we will pay them money. even though these athletes are not having to pay their $120.000 which is the payback financially to the Government. we will go ahead. we like your top pilots. Do you think the Air Force Academy would release those pilots? Not on your life. If Dow Chemical Corporation or some other chemical company. and I like Dow Chemical. if they went to the Air Force Academy and said we would like your top chemists. give us your top chemist students. do you think they would waiver those students out of there? Not on your life. Let me read from an editorial. Rocky Mountain News. A Perk for Military Athletes. ""Roger Staubach graduated from the Naval Academy. served his obligatory 4 years on active duty. and still enjoyed an 11year career with the Dallas Cowboys that put him in the pro football Hall of Fame. ""Times have changed. Beau Morgan. the Air Force Academys star quarterback from the class of 1997. was let out of what is now a 5year commitment after only 2 years so he could try out with the Dallas Cowboys this summer. ""It is part of a trend that apparently began in 1989 when the Naval Academy graduate David Robinson was released after just 2 years active duty. enabling him to play with the NBAs San Antonio Spurs. Now an angry U.S. Representative Scott McInnis. Republican of Colorado. is threatening to introduce legislation that would put an end to this practice. When these kids go to the academy. we try and teach them that you put your Nation above yourself. but that is not what is occurring here. ""There are a number of other examples. Steve Russ. a line backer with the Denver Broncos. was released from his military commitment in 1997. 2 years after his Air Force Academy graduation. Air Force. Academy grad Dan Palmer also got an early out to try out with the Chicago Bears as an offensive lineman. ""For 2 years. McInnis has been trying to use the Freedom of Information Act to get a complete list of those who received waivers from service academies for athletic purposes. but he is having a hard time of it."" ""It is easy to understand why the military schools might be tempted to fudge the rules in order to entice more athletes. For decades they played at the top levels of intercollegiate athletics. but that is no longer true. A military career is just not as attractive to top athletes as it once was. Frustrated academy graduates who are now generals and admirals want to do what they can to slow or reverse the trend. The military tries to justify the current policy by saying that their star athletes serve effectively as academy recruiters upon their early release. but we suspect the kids they mainly recruit are other outstanding athletes who will also expect early releases. Those who get releases. after signing pro contracts. do not have to repay the $120.000 cost of their education and they do not have to go back to active duty even if they are later cut by their teams. Their only obligation is to spend 6 years in the Reserves. ""If pro athletes serve as effective recruiters. says McInnis. why not let United Airlines recruit the top pilots from the Air Force Academy. so long as they say on the airplane. You are being flown -by an Air- Force Academy graduate. ""McInnis dismisses the suggestion that early releases might be all right if the graduate or his employer simply repays the Government the cost of his or her education. The economics of professional athletes are such that $120.000 is merely. quote. what professional teams spend on refreshments at weekend resorts. unquote. ""The point. says McInnis. is that academy athletes deserve no privileges that other graduates cannot get. It is just wrong. he says. of the earlyrelease policy. It makes me mad. ""Considering the athletes the major state universities recruit how little some of them study and how few of them ultimately graduate. the service academies should not be ashamed that their cadets can no longer compete at that level. If they have to play smaller schools. it is no disgrace. ""But the earlyout policy for their athletes is a disgrace. and should be stopped."" Folks. my point is very clear. We are proud of these academies. The Air Force Academy and West Point and the Coast Guard and the Naval Academy have served this country very well. Our great military leaders. some of our presidents. many of our great leaders in this country have come from those academies. Why? Because when you go to an academy. it is a pretty special place. It has the highest of standards. and it has the highest of ethical codes. I think we are diluting that. I think we are diluting the reputation of all the preceding graduates of these academies for the entire history of those academies by taking a special class of athletes and treating them differently. by letting them out of their obligations early. Again. remember. we do not do it for any other class of Air Force or Naval or West Point or Coast Guard Academy graduate. It is wrong. We should stand up and say to the American people. you can expect more. from our academies. I want to mention a couple of other things in conclusion this evening. First of all. as I said earlier. I come from the third district of Colorado. This is a very special season coming up in Colorado so I am going to do a little promotion. I hope all of my colleagues have an opportunity to go out and see our colors in the Aspen trees. The district I represent is the highest district in the United States. They have a lot of beautiful communities. a lot of great ski resorts. Aspen. Sonoma. Steamboat. Telluride. I will get in trouble because I do not name them all. but virtually every ski resort in Colorado is in that district. So if my colleagues get an opportunity. we invite them to come out to Colorado. Come and visit us. Come and see whatbeauty we have out there. But I also want to point. out something else. When my colleagues head out of this city. take a look at how important it is that we allow the average working Joe and the average working Jane in this country to be promised and to expect fair treatment by their Government when it comes to taxes. Every Government leader out there should understand that they have a fiduciary duty. an obligation. to try and deliver the most efficient services the Government can at the least amount of cost. and every Government official out there has an obligation to you. the working Joe and the working Jane. the people that provide these dollars. there is an obligation on behalf of every elected or every Government employee or every Government official to make sure that you are not being overcharged. There is an obligation by every one of us in these chambers to look at that taxpayer and we ought to say thank you to them. We ought to say thank you to the working people of this country. because if it were not for the 8 or 12 or 14 hours they work every day 5 or 6 or 7 days a week. that money to provide for the programs that we run out of these chambers would not be here. We owe them a big thank you. and we also owe them the duty to make sure that when we spend those dollars we spend them effectively. that we are fair to the taxpayer. Our system needs taxes. It has to operate with taxes. but our system has a fundamental requirement of fairness and openness to the people that send that money to Washington. And when we have an opportunity to send that money and put it back in the pocketbooks of those hard working Americans that provide those dollars. we should take it.\n'",reclaim time gentleman hold

I could not gain the consent of the committee to offer my amendment at this time. I think it is. indeed. important that this bill should be amended as suggested In one of the letters I have had read. My bill touches the greater evil of the two. As suggested in the newspaper article. it is hard to distinguish Sunday from any other day in this District. Mr. Speaker. in this Republic the voice of a majority of the people is supremethe majority rules. That a vast majority of the people in America -sanction the observance of the Christiail Sunday is borne out in the fact that every State in the Union except twoCalifornia and Idaho. I believehave a Sunday law. Can it be that all these States. enjoying the blessings of a Sunday law. will. through their Representatives in Congress. deny them to the people of the District of Columbia? There are people in the District who look upon any day of rest as a useless obstacle in the way of their greed. They. of course. oppose this bill. and agree that any man or woman who advocates it is a crank. This is a Christian nation. declared so to be by the Supreme Court of the United States. And the Christian Suhday has been sanctioned by the usages mid customs of a vast majority of the American people. It is well that one day out of every seven should be designated as a day of rest. To allow every sect or society to disregard the Sunday of the American people and carry on their labors as they do in the ""six days"" named in Holy Writ and now recognized throughout the nation as the days in which to labor would be a scrious blunder and a foolish thing to do. Our fathers and mothers have set apart the Christian Sunday as a day of rest. When the foreigner comes to America he comes knowing that this is a Christian nation. and that there is a Sunday recognized by law. but instead of observing the timehonored and lawsanctioned customs of our people we are informed that there are those among us who think that they should be excused from the observance of our day of restthe Christian Sunday. We do not propose to compel them to worship on that day. but we do object to having the Sunday of the American people ignored and miade a day for common labor. Let us show to the world that in the capital of this Godfearing nation the Lords day shall be observed. I desire to include in my remarks a portion of an opinion rendered by Mr. Justice Scott. of the supreme court of Missouri. in the case of the State v. Ambs. passing on the constitutionality of the Sunday law: Those who question the constitutionality of our Sunday laws seem to Imagine that the Constitution is to be regarded as an instrument formed for a State composed of strangers collected from all quarters of the globe. each with a religion of his own. bound by no previous social ties. nor sympathizing in any common reminiscenses of the past. that. unlike ordinary laws. it is not to be construed In reference to the State and condition for those for whom it was intended. but that the words in which it is comprehended are alone to be regarded. without respect to the hlistory of the people for whom it was made. It is apprehended that such is not the mode by which our organic law Is to be interreted. We must regard the people for whom it was ordained. It appears to have been made by Christian men. The Constitution on its face shows that the Christian religion was the religion of its framers. At the conclusion of that instrument it Is solemnly affirmed by its authors. under their hands. that it was done in the year of our Lord 1820a form adopted by all Christian nations. in solemn public acts. to manifest the religion to which they adhere. Loug before the convention which framed our constitution was assembled. experience had shown that the mild voice of Christianity was unable to secure time observance of Sunday as a day of rest. The canention sat under a law exacting a cessation from labor on Sunday. (Edwardss Compilation. vol. 1. 302.) The journal of the convention will show that this law was obeyed by its members as such by adjournments from Saturday until Monday. In the tenth section of the fourth article of the constitution it is provided that if the governor does not return a bill within ten days (Sundays excepted) it shall become a law without his signature. Although It may be said that this provision leaves it optional with the governor whether he will consider bills or not on Sunday. yet. regard being had to the circumstances under which it was Inserted. can any impartial mind deny but that it contains a recoE.aition of the Lords day as a day exempt by all law from all worldly pursuits? The framers of the constitution. then. recognized Sunday as a day to be observed. acting themselves under a law which exacted a compulsive observance of It. If a compulsive observance of the Lords day as a day of rest had been deemed inconsistent with the principles contained in the constitution. can anything be clearer than. as the matter was so plainly and palpably before the convention. a specific condemnation of theSunday law would havebeen ingrafted upon it? So far from it. Sunday was recognized as a day of rest. when. at the same time. a cessation from labor on that day was coerced by a penalty. They. then. who ingrafted on our constitution the principles of religious freedom therein contained. did not regard the compulsory observance of Sunday necessary to secure a full enjoyment of the rights of conscience. How could those who consc.entiously believe that Sunday is a hallowed time. to be devoted to the worship of God. enjoy themselves in its observance amidst all the turmoil and bustle of worldly pursuits. amidst scenes by which the day Is desecrated. which they conscientiously believed to be holy? The Sunday law was not intended to compel people to go to church. or to perform any religious act as an expression of preference for any particular creed or sect. but was designed to coerce a cessation from labor . that those who conscientiously believed that the day was set apart for worship of God might not be disturbed in their performance of their religious duties. Every man Is free to use the day for the purpose for which it Is set apart or not. as he pleases. If he sees proper to devote it to religious purposes. the law protects him from the disturbance of others. If he will not employ himself in religious duties. he is restrained from interrupting those who do. Thus the law. so far from affecting religious freedom. is a means by which the rights of conscience are enjoyed. It can not be maintained that the law exacting a cessation from labor on Sunday compels an act of religious worship. Because divines may teach their church that the reverential observance of the Lords day is an act of religious worship. it by no means follows that the prohibition of worldly labor on that day was designed by the general assembly as an act of religion. Such an idea can only be based upon a supposition of an entire ignorance In the legislature of the nature of worship which God exacts from his creatures. A compliance with the law. induced by a fear of its penalties. could never be regarded as an act acceptable to the Deity. No act of worship. unless dictated by heartfelt love. can be pleasing to the Almighty. God listens alone to the voice of the heart. Bearing in mind that our Constitution was framed for a people whose religion ANas Christianity. who had long lived under and experienced the necessity of laws to secure the observance of Sunday as a day of rest. how remarkable would it have been that they should have agreed to make common. by their fundamental law. a day consecrated from the very birth of their religion. and hallowed by associations dear to every Christian. Convert Sunday Into a worldly day by law. and what becomes of Christianity? How can we reconcile the idea to our understanding. that a people professing Christianity would make a fundamental law by wlhich they would convert Sunday into a worldly day? It would have been an act of deadly hestility to the reltgion they professed. exposing it to the danger of being reduced to the condition in which it was before the Roman world was governed by Christion princes. Though it might not be persecuted by the arm of the civil power. it would be driven by the annoyances and interruptions of the world to corners and byplaces. in which to find a retreat for its undisturbed exercise. How startling would be the announcement to the people of Missouri that. by their organic law. they had abolished Sunday as a day of rest. and had put it out of the power of their legislators ever to restore it as such? With what sorrow would. the toilworn laborer receive the Intelligence that there was no longer by law a day of rest from his labor? The poor beasts of burden would soon find by experience that our laws were no longer tempered by the softening influence of ChristianIty. and all the social advantages by which great and good men have attributed to the observances of Sunday as a day of rest would be taken away. In conclusion. we are of opinion that there Is nothing inconsistent with the Constitution. as it was understood at the time of its adoption. with a law compelling the observance of Sunday as a day of rest. The Constitution itself recognizes that day as a day of rest. and from the circumstances under which it was done. we are warranted In the opinion that a power to compel a cessation from labor on that day was not designated to be withheld from the legislature. Now. Mr. Speaker.

Here is a director at $12.000. and two assistants at $7.500 each. Why. if you do that you will disarrange the salaries of almost every bureau chief in this Government. Go Into the legislative bill and you will find that there is not a single bureau chief who has got a salary anything like that. You will find as a rule that $5.000 is a big salary for most any bureau chief. In rare instances they are fixed at $6.000. If you want to put a prize in the hands of every bureau chief you will do it by fixing the salary at this enormously high rate. Then you will find that you have raised up an enormous amount of trouble in the future. But first I want to know what character of a man you will have to administer the provisions of this bill and the sort of experience and business ability that he has. and we want to know something about these assistant engineers. Here are four civilian engineers at $5.000 each. clerical help. miscellaneous supplies. without telling you anything about the salaries. $20.000. Rent of eight district offices in Washington. $9.600. clerical help and supplies for eight district offices. $32.000. Traveling expenses exclusive of Army Engineers estimated at $7.000. Legal expense estibnated. $10.000. Allowance for expansion and other unforeseen contingencies. $24.400. Is there an appropriation committee in this House that on that mere statement without any further explanation would appropriate that sum of money? As far as delays are concerned. I want to say to the gentleman that it will never delay the bill one minute because in bills of this kind. If this amendment shall be adopted. before the bill gets out of the Senate the Appropriation Committee can go into the details having before us the amount of money and the character of service and will try to keep up some .harmony in the salaries and not disorganize the whole program. If this is to be the policy adopted in future. you will have no sort of rule for the salaries of men to take charge of these bureaus. Let this bill pass making an authorization of $150.000 to pay for a temporary organization and if this business shall grow rapidly. as it may. $150.000 may not be enough. but when you come to the Appropriations Committee you will find the committee confronted with this status of giving enormous high salaries. and we will be embarrassed In attempting to reduce them. My friend from South Carolina calls my attention to the fact that even a Cabinet officers salary Is only $12.000. and yet you propose to give to this bureau under this bill $12.000 right off the reel without knowing a thing on earth who lie is. what the duties are that are going to be devolved upon him. So. gentlemen of the committee. the mere display of this detailed statement sent to the chalrian of the committee is the highest evidence of why we ought to let tills take its orderly course. As far as patriotism is concerned. I take it that no man could be ciarged as being unpatriotic who refuses to take from the taxpayers of America while we are appealing to them all over the country to respond in tle. buying of the bonds to pay the expenses of the war.

I stand before you today to recognize and honor the accomplishments of a truly remarkable woman. On May 5. members of the Flint. Michigan. Northern High School Alumni Association will gather to honor five Distinguished Fellows. members of their alumni community who have contributed to legacy and rich history of Northern High School. and of Flint. One Distinguished Fellow to be honored is the late Ms. Cecile Hershon. Born in Lansing. Michigan in 1920. Cecile Hershon and her family eventually moved to Flint. where she graduated from Northern High School in 1938. In 1944. Cecile was recruited by the United States Army and began her long military career as a civilian clerk in Arlington. Virginia. From there she went on to become a part of the newly merged Army and Navy Signal Services. first known as the Armed Forces Security Agency as is currently what we know as the National Security Agency. Cecile began to further her career with the National Security Agency. becoming adept as intelligence research. analysis. and reporting. and soon became a exceptional cryptographer. She later accepted an overseas position where she continued to perfect her skills. allowing her to function in a variety of supervisory and management positions. Throughout her career. which spanned an incomparable 42 years. Cecile received numerous honors and commendations. including one of the agencys highest honors. the National Meritorious Civilian Service Award in 1986. Cecile also became involved in WINWomen in NSA. an organization dedicated to increasing personal growth and development among both men and women within the NSA. As a member of WIN. Cecile was honored with their Presidents Award on two separate occasions. She was also the first recipient of WINs Dorothy T. Blum Award for excellence in personal and professional development. In addition to being a model employee. Cecile was an ardent humanitarian as well. She was constantly found extending a helping hand to friends. colleagues. and sometimes mere acquaintances. sometimes at her own personal or professional expense. and with no thought of personal gain. Countless members of the NSA and the military attribute their success to Ceciles support and encouragement. There have been many accounts of people who were convinced by Cecile to remain in the NSA. complete their education. and honor familial obligations. Indeed. many of our military are better soldiers due to the influence of Cecile Hershon. Mr. Speaker. Cecile Hershon lived her life in a truly selfless and benevolent manner. and it goes without saying that her influence extends even to this day. Her lifes work. serving her country for so long as a civilian. is commanding of the highest respect.\n',stand today recognize honor accomplishment remarkable woman member gather honor member alumnus community contribute legacy rich history honor late bear family move graduate cecile recruit begin long military career civilian clerk go become part merge know know begin further career become adept intelligence research analysis report become exceptional cryptographer accept overseas position continue perfect skill allow function variety supervisory management position career_span incomparable year cecile receive numerous honor commendation include agencys high honor become involve organization dedicate increase personal growth development man woman member honor separate occasion first recipient win excellence personal professional development addition model employee ardent humanitarian find extend help hand friend colleague mere acquaintance own personal professional expense thought personal gain countless member military attribute success cecile support encouragement many account people convince cecile remain complete education honor familial obligation many military well soldier influence live life selfless benevolent manner go say influence extend day life work serve country civilian command high respect.\n,106.0,daily,0,1

This res6lution was sent to the House for their immediate consideration. Many have concluded that the House had until midnight on Tuesday. February 3. 1987. to act or the pay raises would take effect automatically as -provided by the omnibus continuing resolution for fiscal 1986. The House did not take action before the midnight deadline. This joint resolution I am introducing will give the House the opportunity to provide the citizens of this country with a recorded vote on this Important matter. As I stated earlier. it is not the appropriate time for Members of Congress to vote themselves or any other highlevel public servants a pay raise. Our national debt exceeds $2 trillion. This salary proposal is contrary to our efforts to resolve this massive debt and balance the Federal budget. I must again reiterate that we have asked those on Social Security. military retirement. and others to take less. It is not appropriate that we ask those on fixed incomes to take less while we take more. I urge the Senate to take immediate action so the House will have the opportunity to act on this measure as soon as possible. The Members of this body voted last week by an overwhelming majority against these increases. I urge them to again do likewise. Mr. President. I think the joint resolution is selfexplanatory. I do not think we need a lot of debate. It Is the same type of resolution that we passed several days ago. and I ask for immediate action in the hope that there will be no opposition to the joint resolution.\n',today rise introduce joint_resolution repeal pay increase member highlevel official judge vote overwhelming_margin disallow pay increase member federal judge highlevel official send immediate consideration many conclude midnight act pay raise take effect -provide omnibus continue resolution fiscal take action midnight deadline joint_resolution introduce give opportunity provide citizen country record vote important matter state appropriate time member vote other highlevel public_servant pay raise national debt exceed salary proposal contrary effort resolve massive debt balance budget reiterate ask military retirement other take less appropriate ask fix income take less take more urge take immediate action opportunity act measure possible member body vote last week overwhelming_majority increase urge think joint_resolution selfexplanatory think need lot debate same type resolution pass several day ask immediate action hope opposition joint_resolution.\n,100.0,daily,1,0
1020147275,S,19920319,375,Mr. SIMON,Unknown,SIMON,Unknown,M,21959,22193,03191992.txt,7525,451,102109791,SIMON,PAUL,S,IL,M,D,,voting,"Mr. President. first I want to commend our colleague from Oklahoma. Senator BoRm. for his leadership on this matter. This is a concept that is long overdue. Let me just say to my colleague from Oklahoma. Senator ROBB came over to me while the Senator was speaking. and he wants to be added as a cosponsor. So we now have nine cosponsors instead of eight. We are moving in the right direction. We have to do something. Mr. President. to make this country more productive. In February 1991. we had 8.131.000 people who were listed as unemployed. In February 1992. 9.244.000 Americans were unemployedan increase of 1.113.000 who are listed as unemployed. I will get back to why I mentioned listed. In my State of Illinois. in February 1991. 362.000 people were listed as unemployed. In February 1992. 1 year later. 521.000 Illinoisans were unemployedan increase of 159.000 in one State. I say listed as unemployed because this does not count the discouraged worker. the person who is just giving up. who no longer is signing up at the employment officewho has just really given up on our society. These figures do not count the person who works parttime. If you work 1 hour a week. you are not counted as unemployed. The great division in our society is not between black and white. not between Hispanic and Anglo. not even between rich and poor. It is between those who have hope and those who have given up. We have too many people in our society who have given up. We need to give them that sense of hope. and two things. and two things only. really give people a sense of hope. One is to have a job and feel like you are offering something. contributing something in a productive way to our society. The second is to see that your children are moving ahead edUcationally. We have to give people one of those two Indications of hope. and we can really given them both. We have all kinds of things that need to be done in our country. And we have all kinds of people who are unemployed. Why do we not have the good sense to mesh the two? We ought to be doing that. For some time. I have been working on this concept and I am very pleased to have Senator BoREN join in this effort. I wrote a book a few years back. called ""Lets Put America Back to Work."" suggesting that we really can learn from that WPA concept. We have. for example. among the unemployed. a great many people who really know how to read and write. In fact. while I was on a radio callin show someone called in and said. ""Believe It or not. I have a doctorate. and I am temporarily out of work. I am sure it is temporary."" But if I could be teaching someone how to read and write or doing something like that. I would be happy to do it. There is no reason we cannot be doing that. We have all kinds of people who do not know how to read and write. We have people who know how and who are unemployed. Why do we not put the two together? Why do we not do things that are needed and that everyone acknowledges are needed? For example. why not plant some trees in this country? Not too long ago in southern Illinois. not far from my home. I went past a field where I saw they were clearing the trees so a farmer could plant corn or soybeans or whatever he or she wanted to plant. And I understand that. But when you cut down those trees. when you put in new shopping centers and parking lots and housing developments. down the river somewhere you are going to have floods and you are going to have a demand from somebody. ""Let us get the Corps of Engineers in here to have a flood control project."" What if we took the people who are out of work today and planted 1 million trees each year. or 10 million trees each year? We would be a better country all the way around. Mr. President. because I know of your interest in the literary field. I think you will recognize this particular example. When I was about 12 years old. I read Richard Wrights book. ""Black Boy."" It is not as famous as his book ""Native Son."" but it was a moving. gripping experience for me to read what it meant for someone to grow up as an AfricanAmerican in this country. It was not until many years later that I learned that Richard Wright learned to write under a WPA project. Instead of just having him be nonproductive. we had him writing and he enriched the Nation and he enriched me in this process. This bill will head to the Labor and Human Resources Committee. I assume. and to the Subcommittee on Employment that I chair. I think we are going to- have to modify it some. I think initially we are probably going to have a few demonstration projects. Let us see what we can do to let people be productive and earn a little more money in the process. The average family on welfare in the State of Illinois collects $367 a month. Under this proposal you would work 4 days a week at the minimum wage on projects that are picked by local committees. That is not a lot of money. but it would amount to $535 a month. For someone making $367. that is a significant improvement. But it also gives people a chance to be productive. We are going to pay people for being productive or nonproductive. and I think we ought to be paying people for being productive. Part of what I hope will be part of this is that we will have a screening process. and if people are out of workand incidentally. part of this bill provides that 25 percent of the Jobs are reserved not for those on welfare but for people who are out of work 5 weeks or more. One of the mistakes we make in our society today is that we force people to become paupers before we help them. We can do better than that. Mr. President. I think It follows logically on the proposals that have been made and the leadership that has been provided by Senator MoyixiAN. our colleague from New York. who has been stressing training and other things as part of what we ought to be providing in the welfare field. I mentioned that people will wOrk 4 days a week. That was the way it was in the old WPA for the very important reason that on the fifth day you can be out trying to find a job in the private sector. What we want to do is to give people an opportunity to work but we also want to encourage them to be out looking for work in the private sector. Mr. President. the need is simply overwhelming. We have been too indifferent to the desperate in our society. We must give them a chance to be productive. a chance to have pridethat is what everyone wants. Furthermore. these opportunities coincide with our needs as a nation. The New York Times 2 weeks ago had figures. and I remember them going back over a 12year period. for the productivity growth of the United States and some other countries. Productivity growth in the United States for that 12year period. was 12 percent1 percent a year. The productivity growth for Great Britain was 33 percent. For France. 38 percent. for what was then West Germany. 39 percent. for Japan. 58 percent. We have to become more productive as a people. and we are going to be competing with the rest of the world in one of two ways. Economists do not agree on very much. as you know. Mr. President. but they do agree on this: We compete with the rest of the world either with low wages or high skills. I want us to be productive. I want us to compete with high skills. I want to give the people we are ignoring in our society a chance. I think the bill that has been introduced by Senator BOREN does exactly that. I am pleased to be a cosponsor. I hope this bill will move us in the right direction.\n'",want commend colleague leadership matter concept overdue let say colleague robb come speak want add cosponsor cosponsor move right direction make country productive people list unemployed unemployedan increase list unemployed get mention list people list unemployed year increase say list unemployed count discouraged worker person give sign employment officewho give society figure count person work parttime work hour week count unemployed great division society black_white anglo_rich poor hope give many people society give need give sense hope thing thing give people sense hope job feel offer contribute productive way society second see child move give people hope give kind thing need do country kind people unemployed good sense mesh do time work concept pleased boren join effort write book few year call put work suggest learn concept example unemployed great many people know read write fact radio_callin show call say believe doctorate work sure temporary teach read write do happy reason do kind people know read write people know unemployed put thing need acknowledge need example plant tree country southern home go field see clear tree farmer plant corn_soybean want plant understand cut tree put new shopping_center parking_lot housing development river go flood go demand let get flood control project take people work today plant tree year tree year well country way know interest literary field think recognize particular example year old read book famous book move grip experience read mean grow country many year learn learn write project have nonproductive write enrich enrich process bill head assume chair think go modify think go few demonstration project let see let people productive earn little more money process average family welfare collect month proposal work day week minimum_wage project pick local committee lot money amount month make significant improvement give people chance productive go pay people productive nonproductive think pay people productive part hope part screening process people workand part bill provide percent reserve welfare people work week more mistake make society today force people become pauper help think follow proposal make leadership provide colleague stress training other thing part provide welfare field mention people work day week way old important reason fifth day try find job private_sector want give people opportunity work want encourage look work private_sector need overwhelming indifferent desperate society give chance productive chance want opportunity coincide need nation week figure remember go period productivity growth other country productivity growth period percent year productivity growth percent percent percent percent become productive people go compete rest world way economist agree know agree compete rest world low wage high skill want productive want compete high skill want give people ignore society chance think bill introduce pleased cosponsor hope bill move right direction.\n,102.0,daily,0,1
900177871,S,19671206,1040,Mr. MORSE,Unknown,MORSE,Unknown,M,61563,61785,12061967.txt,7630,464,90098531,MORSE,WAYNE,S,OR,M,D,,voting,"Mr. President. one other matter on which I shall detain the Senate for only a very short time. I have sent to the Press Gallery today a statement which bears on the subject matter of the exporting of logs to Japan. It so happens that the Senator from Washington and I have been working hard in recent weeks on the very serious problem which has developed in the Pacific Northwest as aresult of the exportation of large quantities of logs to Japan. This exportation has resulted. in effect. in the exportation of thousands of American jobs to Japan. These logs are raw materials out of which lumber products are made. There is no doubt that the exportation of these logs has provided some new jobs for our longshoremen. seamen. and stevedoring companies and the many people who work in ports. I want to make it clear that we seek to work out a program with the State Department. Department of the Interior. and Department of Agriculture. in negotiations that are about to take place with representatives from Japan. that will strike a fair balance in respect to the economic interests of all segments of the economy of the Pacific Northwest. I want to say. to the great credit of the stevedoring companies and longshore unions and other groups in the Pacific Northwest whose livelihood comes from the operation of the ports. that they recognize the need for striking that balance. They are not advocating unchecked. unrestricted shipment of logs in whatever quantities the Japanese want to buy them. They have been cooperating with us in trying to work out a program with the Government that will give protection to the lumber industry of the Pacific Northwest. The Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management assured members of Congress yesterday first. that they understand the urgency of the log export situation. second. that they recognize they have a responsibility to protect local communities dependent upon their timber. and. third. that they can act under existing law to carry out that responsibility. I deeply appreciate the complete cooperation among Senator HATFIELD. Representatives GREEN. WYATT. DELLENBACH. and ULLMAN. as we. as a united Oregon delegation. have pressed for a Government program that would give protection to the lumber economy of our State. We have said for a long time that we felt the U.S. Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management had authority within existing law to issue whatever rules and regulations and administrative orders were necessary to give to the lumber communities of our State the protection in Federal timber sales to which they are entitled. To the great credit of the representatives of the two agencies. in the conference held with us yesterday afternoon. they recognized that they have authority to act in a manner that will carry out their responsibility. That is real progress. because until yesterday. they had tended to point to all the policing troubles that would be involved in export limitations on public timber sales. rather than talking about the powers they had to curb the exports. Our next problem will come tomorrow when members of the Oregon and Washington delegations meet with the State Department negotiators who will talk to Japanese negotiators in Washington. D.C.. starting December 11. The industry has not recommended a strong position -for us to take in the talks. other than to -impress Japan with the distress of the industry. But it is meaningless to complain to Japan and wait for Japan to suggest a remedy. Therefore. I shall urge the State Department not only to explain the problem. but specifically to seek agreement with Japan that the Japanese Government will take more U.S. lumber products and fewer logs. One of the unfortunate things about this controversy is that Japan really has a cartel operating in this field. Japan has restrictions on the importation of finished lumber in Japan. They really have a twomarket system over there. An American producer of lumber must sell to the cartel. No matter what the U.S. price is the cartel markets it at the same price it fixes for its own lumber. There is no price competition from U.S. imports into Japan. If Japan wants to act in good faith with us for an agreement that will involve the shipment of a certain quantity of logs. she ought to be willing to enter into. as part of that agreement. an understanding that she will take a much larger quantity of finished lumber into Japan. It has been my position from the very beginning that the high prices she bids for our logs are possible only because she shelters her domestic market from our competition in lumber products. Our first objective should be to break down this Japanese trade barrier. and there seems to be much support for that position on the part now of the Federal timber agencies. A larger supply of lumber should bring down their own prices enough to bring down what they can bid on our logs. But in any case. we should seek to export the lumber rather than the logs. . I want to thank the spokesmen for the Forest Service and the Department of the Interior for the understanding of this problem that they made clear to us yesterday. They made us aware of their determination to be of assistance to the people of the Pacific Northwest in the protection of their economic interests in the field of the lumber operations of the Pacific Northwest. I feel that with a specific proposal of this kind. we will be more likely to get results. We are in a position now to show that the problem is so serious that. if Japan does not agree to that kind of shift in her purchases. the U.S. Government will act to protect its timber resource. Therefore. if we cannot get some relief in regard to the great damage that is being done to the economy of the Pacific Northwest because of the purchasing raids of Government logsthat is. logs taken off the Federal forestsand an agreement between the U.S. State Department and the Government of Japan. the senior Senator from Oregon will convene. not later than January 15. his subcommittee of the Small Business Committee of the U.S. Senate. at which hearings representatives of the U.S. Government will be requested to appear to explain their policies and subject themselves to the examination of the committee. On the basis of the record made. I will then recommendif it becomes necessary. which I hope it will notnecessary legislation to give to the people of the Pacific Northwest the protection which they are entitled to receive from December. 6. 1967 their Government in respect to the timber resources of the Pacific Northwest. The State Department will be invited first. because they have the main job of seeking a voluntary arrangement with Japan of the kind I have described. If that falls through. then we have no choice but to deal directly with the problem through legislation long on the books designed to assure a timber supply to domestic mills. and more legislation. if necessary. I know the administration is fearful of ""making waves"" in our relations with Japan. It is anxious to maintain at least lipservice from Japan for the Vietnam war. But here is an industry already crippled from the war. If we really are doing Japan such a favor by fighting in Vietnam. we should be insisting that she refrain from economic policies that further damage an industry already weakened by the economic impact of the war. Japan is already profiteering from the expenditures we make there to supply our troops. Here is one small place where Japan could make an accommodation. She could buy our lumber instead of our logs. and the State Department should press her to do so.\n'",other matter detain short time send today statement bear subject matter exporting_log happen work recent week serious problem develop aresult exportation large quantity log exportation result effect exportation thousand american job log raw_material lumber product make doubt exportation log provide new job longshoreman_seaman stevedore company many people work port want make clear seek work program negotiation about take place representative strike fair balance respect economic interest segment economy want say great credit stevedore company longshore union other group livelihood come operation port recognize need strike balance advocate unchecked unrestricted shipment log quantity want buy cooperate try work program give protection lumber industry assure member yesterday understand urgency log export situation recognize responsibility protect local community dependent timber third act exist law carry responsibility appreciate complete cooperation representative united delegation press program give protection lumber economy say long time feel authority exist law issue rule regulation administrative order necessary give lumber community state protection timber sale entitle great credit representative agency conference hold yesterday afternoon recognize authority act manner carry responsibility real progress yesterday tend point police trouble involve export limitation public timber sale talk power curb export next problem come tomorrow member delegation meet negotiator talk japanese negotiator start industry recommend strong position take talk other -impress distress industry meaningless complain wait suggest remedy urge explain problem seek agreement japanese take more lumber product few log unfortunate thing controversy cartel operate field restriction importation finished_lumber twomarket system american producer lumber sell cartel price cartel market same price fix own lumber price competition import want act good faith agreement involve shipment certain quantity log willing enter part agreement understanding take large quantity finished_lumber position very beginning high price bid log possible shelter domestic market competition lumber product first objective break japanese trade barrier seem much support position part timber agency large supply lumber bring own price enough bring bid log case seek export lumber log want thank spokesman understanding problem make clear yesterday make aware determination assistance people protection economic interest field lumber operation feel specific proposal kind likely get result position show problem serious agree kind shift purchase act protect timber resource get relief regard great damage do economy purchasing raid log take forestsand agreement senior convene subcommittee hearing representative request appear explain policy subject examination committee basis record make recommendif become necessary hope notnecessary legislation give people protection entitle receive government respect timber resource invite main job seek voluntary arrangement kind describe fall choice deal problem legislation book design assure timber supply domestic mill more legislation necessary know administration fearful make wave relation anxious maintain least lipservice war industry crippled war do favor fight insist refrain economic policy damage industry weaken economic impact war profiteer expenditure make supply troop small place make accommodation buy lumber log press so.\n,90.0,bound,0,1

I was 93d in Senate seniority. When the 105th Congress convened this past January. I was 12th. What a difference 22 years make. My 22 years of service to the people of Kentucky. as their U.S. Senator. has been during a remarkable period in history. We have witnessed the end of the cold war and the fall of the Berlin Wall. We have witnessed a technological boom that was unthinkable 22 years ago and weve witnessed the growth of democracy in practically every underdeveloped nation in the world. We have also seen the cost of a college education skyrocket. We have seen the cost of medical care skyrocket. And last but not least. weve seen the cost of a political campaign skyrocket. The average cost of a U.S. Senate race in 1974. the first year I ran. was less than $450.000. In fact. $437.482. The average cost of a Senate race last year was approximately $4.5 million. There is no job. especially the job of public servant. that is worth or deserves the effort necessary to raise and spend that much money. The job of being a U.S. Senator today has unfortunately become a job of raising money to be reelected instead of a job doing the peoples business. Traveling to New York. California. Texas. or basically any State in the country. weekend after weekend. for the next 2 years is what candidates must do if they hope to raise the money necessary to compete in a senatorial election. Democracy as we know it will be lost if we continue to allow government to become one bought by the highest bidder. for the highest bidder. Candidates will simply become bit players and pawns in a campaign managed and manipulated by paid consultants and hired guns. Because of the political money chase. Washington. DC is fast becoming the center of our lives. not our people back home. The money chase has got to stop. We must reform the system so that ordinary. everyday people. who want to run for political office and make our country a better place are able to do so. I have spent a good part of my Senate career and political life working to nudge and. occasionally shove our party back toward the center of the political road. I came to Washington as a moderate Democrat. believing then as I still do. that the will of the people comes first. Ive tried to be a moderate voice and will continue to do so. I love our country too much to let the extremists ram their agenda down our throats. There are many challehges facing the Senate and our party as we march into the next millennium. More than ever. I want to be involved in addressing some of them. I am not in the business to get my name in lights or to appear on the national TV talk shows or make headlines in the national newspapers. My philosophy has always been and will continue to be keep a low profile. work behind the scenes with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. and come up with a solution that benefits everyone. Compromise is not a dirty word. I plan on working this way in the months ahead. Now of a more immediate and personal concern. Do I run again for another term in 1998? My health is good. my mind is sharp. and I enjoy what I do as much as life itself. However. because my mind is sharp. it is quick to remind me that I am 72 years old and I will be 74 in November of 1998. The good Lord has a plan for every one of us. even me. My heart says that my love affair with the people of Kentucky is not over. My head says it has been a long ride and a good ride but now it is time to pass the reins on to a younger generation. Today I will lead with my head and not my heart. So the time has come for me to announce that I will not be a candidate for reelection in 1998. As you try to understand my decision. let me ask you to do something for me. if you will. Dont say that Im ready to go because Im not and. frankly. I never will be. I still get goose bumps every time I look up at the Capitol dome on my way to and from work. You can say that my reelection campaign would be my most expensive race ever. I do not relishin fact. I detestthe idea of having to raise $5 million for a job that pays $133.000 a year. To reach that mark. I would have to raise $100.000 a week. starting today. for the next year. Please dont say that my time has passed and I should be put out to pasture. because I dont believe that it has. The political philosophy that I embrace is just as relevant today as it was when I first entered public life 30 years ago. It is a philosophy centered on the. fact that most Kentuckians cherish personal freedom more than either a liberal agenda or a competing conservative agenda that just uses Government in a different way to promote its goals. I thank the people of Kentucky from the bottom of my heart for giving me the chance to be their voice for these fourplus terms here in the U.S. Senate. I have been blessed with good friends and dedicated supporters all around my State. who have been there time and time again when I have called for their help. No one serves the people alone. He or she must have a good. bright. hardworking staff for support. I have been blessed with an abundance of such a staff. They have proven themselves more than capable of handling any situation thrown at them. Their unequaled loyalty and total devotion to their work. especially in handling constituent services. both in my district offices and here in Washington. is proven time and time again. My staff is simply the best. as the thousands of constituents who have used them will attest. In announcing last month that he would not run again. my good friend and colleague. JOHN GLENN. put it in perspective when he said. ""There still is no cure for the common birthday."" I believe that 100 percent. and I want to leave here knowing that I have a lot more birthdays to celebrate with my family. Now. speaking of family. no oneand I repeat. no onecould ask for a more supportive and loving family than mine. My wife. Jean. has been my anchor for over 50 years. My children. Shirley and Steve. have had to grow up with an absentee father a lot of the time. But they know in their hearts how much I love them. I plan on helping them in the years to come the way they have been there for me all these many years. As for my grandchildren. I cant wait to spend more time with them and. hopefully. learn a thing or two from them. Ill finally have the time to dote on them and spoil them the way a grandfather is supposed to do. Mr. President. let me close by reading the last paragraph from a poem entitled ""A Year."" which I have carried with me for many. many years. My son had it right when he wrote this back during his sophomore year at Frankfort High School. He is now married and has three lovely sons and. still. he had it right much earlier than I thought he did. This is the last of four paragraphs. referring to the seasons: Another year has passed. the days not slow or fast. Burned deep within our brain. its memories will ever remain. And although you look back and stood. wishing there had been more good. No one can change the seasons. cept God. and hes had no reason. I thank the Chair for giving me thip time.

I want to get to that point immediately because he is in the Chamber now. I want to pay tribute to the effort he has made to try to end what is a real unfairness in our law. The unfairness is that our disabled veterans are not permitted to receive both retired pay and VA disability compensation. This is something that is unique to our veteransthat they are not able to receive both the retired pay plus the disability compensation. which they have been awarded. It sounds unusual to say one is ""awarded"" compensation for disability. We had a provision in the Senate bill to address this inequity. We would have allowed our disabled veterans. as others in the Federal Government employ and others in society. to receive both retirement and disability pay. The House leadership was not willing to have a vote on the budget point of order. which would have been made. which would have authorized this benefit to be paid. So we were left with no alternative. Senator WARNER and I were both there in conference. day after day. We pointed out that Senator Harry Reid has been a champion on this. and there are others in this body who have pointed out the inequity in the provision that prohibits thereceipt of both retired pay and disability compensation. At the end. we could not persuade the House to include this provision and have a point of order contested in the House. So what we ended up with was something a lot less than what we hoped we would get. and that is the authorization for these payments to be made. the authorization to end the unfairness. but it would still require an appropriation in order to fund them.\n'",wish take other part bill include involved want get point want pay tribute effort make try end real unfairness law unfairness disabled_veteran permit receive retire pay disability compensation unique_veteransthat able receive retired pay disability compensation award sound unusual say award compensation disability provision bill address inequity allow disabled_veteran other employ other society receive retirement disability pay leadership willing vote budget point order make authorize benefit pay leave alternative conference day day point champion other body point inequity provision prohibit thereceipt retire pay disability compensation end persuade include provision point order contest end lot less hope get authorization payment make authorization end unfairness require appropriation order fund them.\n,107.0,daily,0,1

I am heartily in favor of the amendment whlich has been offered by the senior Senator from New Hampshire strikinlg from the bill the antiefficiency provision. I have opposed this sort of provision in times past. I was strongly in opposition to it after I had heard much testimony and listened to arguments on both sides of the question. The term "" stop watch."" which has been mentioned by the Senator from South Carolina . however. as used in the pending bill is not a relic of barbarism nor is it employed to take from any workman any proper right which belongs to him. That word is used by the enemies of efficiency legislation to make the provision obnoxious. It has got into the legislation for this reason and in this way: For a great many years there has been an honest. intelligent effort made to conserve labor and to make it efficient by preventing unnecessary effort and making necessary effort greatly effective. Efficiency is an essential to the proper education of every boy and girl. It was thought that if a fair days work for the average man could be determinednot for the most expert and the most efficient. but for the average manthat that days work could be used as the basis of pay for other men of all classes who wished to strive for it. According to tile testimony that was submitted to the Committee on Appropriations some three or four years ago this method was adopted in the Watertown Arsenal. The way the stop watch was used was this: An ordinary man. an average man. was selected from among tihe employees. one who was fairly familiar. as familiar. perhaps. as anyone with the work that was to be asked of him. and was set at a particular task. and while lie was at work he was timed by the watch. Every display of energy. every minute of time was observed and registered. It was *not compulsory work. but I lie watch was held on him for the purpose of determining how long it took him to perform a certain task and every stage of it. After lie had performed that task and it had been repeated by two or three other average men. so that it was determined about how much time it took to perform it. then tiat amount of time was enlarged 75 per cent . that Is. if it took him an hour. they gave any other man an hour and threequarters. They even enlarged that to some extent. and then said to their inen. "" If you can perform this task in one and threequarter hours ""-or whatever time was fixed-"" you shall receive a bonus in addition to what you received before."" It was an encouragement to men to help themselves and their employer. the Government. The only argument that I have ever heard tlatwas worth copsidering in opposition to this plan is that it might possibly induce men to work harder than they ought to work. that mn. anxious to obtain the additional compensation offered. might imperil their health or injure themselves by putting forth this extra effort. but there is no argumnent that can stand the light of logic against paying a man who does extra work extra compensation. In this stressful time of emergency I am not so much disturbed over the possibility tbat men may work too hard as I am that they will work too little. More evil comes from idleness and slacking than from overwork. It was discovered in the Watertown Arsenal that through this efficiency system production was increased more than 25 per cent. and the men were happy and prosperoug. Outside influences sought to disturb it. Leaders of organized labor in some parts of the country tried to create dissatisfaction among the men in that arsenal with what was being done there. The mel] themselves were called before their overseers and asked if they were dissatisfied. if tlfey were being injured. if anything occurred under this method that was unsatisfactory to them. and there were only two men out of the whole lot who made any complaint. It is doubtful if any proposition of management could have been presented to these men that would have had as few protestants as this one had. Every man who was interviewed privately said. "" I am satisfied."" But after the matter had been sufficiently agitated outside. a sort of round robin was circulated among the men and. as I believe. coercively presented. protesting against this efficiency service: That is the way the matter finally reached the department. Mr. President. I am satisfied. as stated by the junior Senator from New York . that the men themselves want this provision. It gives them an opportunity to earn more money. It presents an opportunity at this time to demonstrate their patriotism.\n'",favor amendment offer senior strikinlg bill antiefficiency provision oppose sort provision time past opposition hear much testimony listen argument side question term stop watch mention use pende bill relic_barbarism employ take workman proper right belong word use enemy efficiency legislation make provision obnoxious get legislation reason way great many year honest intelligent effort make conserve labor make efficient prevent unnecessary effort make necessary effort effective efficiency essential proper education boy_girl think fair day work average man determinednot most expert efficient average manthat day work use basis pay other man class wish strive accord tile testimony submit year method adopt way stop watch use ordinary man average man select tihe employee familiar familiar work ask set particular task lie work time watch display energy minute time observe register compulsory work lie watch hold purpose determine take perform certain task stage lie perform task repeat other average man determined much time take perform amount time enlarge cent take hour give other man hour threequarter enlarge extent say inen perform task threequarter hour -or time fixed- receive bonus addition receive encouragement man help employer only argument hear tlatwa worth copsidere opposition plan induce man work work anxious obtain additional compensation offer imperil health injure put extra effort argumnent stand light logic pay man extra work extra compensation stressful time emergency disturb possibility tbat man work work little more evil come idleness slacking overwork discover efficiency system production increase more cent man happy outside influence seek disturb leader organize labor part country try create dissatisfaction man arsenal do mel call overseer ask dissatisfied injure occur method unsatisfactory man whole lot make complaint doubtful proposition management present man few protestant one man interview say satisfied matter agitate sort round_robin circulate man believe present protest efficiency service way matter reach department satisfied state junior man want provision give opportunity earn more money present opportunity time demonstrate patriotism.\n,65.0,bound,1,0

I have made this speech so many times I irritate some of my colleagues.

This year. as pointed out by the distinguished gentleman from North Carolina. the Secretary finally got around to offering 1 million of the shorteststaple cotton we had. hoping to sell it in a year. and he sold it in less than 60 days. Only yesterday did they get around to opening the bids on the sale of any more cotton. I would point out to you the record: Last year my subcommittee pointed out that the Department had unlimited authority to sell CCC farm commodities in world trade at any competitive price essential to move them. We pointed out that this then $10 billion corporation had no sales manager or sales organization. We pointed out that the Department had insufficient information on expanded foreign production and on what foreign countries were doing to export their commodities. We pointed out that our information as to where the money between the farmer and the consumer. the spread. was going was entirely inadequate. Our committee set up funds separately for those purposes only. The Secretary said in the press our report was politics. yet the House passed our bill without amendment. The Secretary went to the Senate and had these provisions stricken from the bill. We went to conference with the Senate and such provisions were put back in the bill and all conferees signed the report. House Members and Senators. Republicans and Democrats.

I rise tonight to talk about and make the American people aware that we have 1.446 days counting down to the tax increase to the American people which will oc cur on January 1. 2011. if the new majority. the Democrats in Congress. dont act to extend the tax cuts that the Republicans put in place in 2001 and 2003. So in 1.446 days. we will see that tax increase. The Democrats dont have to act. all they have to do is run out the clock. Run out the clock. and we will see a $200 billion tax increase. It will be money taken out of American peoples pockets between now and January 1. 2011. if they dont act. Those tax cuts as I said were enacted in 2001 and 2003. And what we have seen is an expansion in our economy. a great expansion that continues to this day that has created over the last 4 years 7.2 million jobs. Just in the month of December. 167.000 jobs were created in this country. The unemployment rate is down to 4.6 percent. It is the lowest average we have seen in 4 decades. and that is directly attributable to the tax cuts that we passed in this Congress in 2001 and 2003. Again. if we dont extend them. which I believe is the responsible thing to do so we see this economy continue to grow. we are going to take money right out of the pockets of the American taxpayers. Mr. Speaker. we will be debating tomorrow a tax increase. It has not taken longer than 20 days for the new Democratic majority to increase taxes. There will be a great debate here. and there are many in this country who think we should increase taxes on our oil companies. But it is the reduction in the tax on our oil companies that has allowed them to go out and look for new oil reserves to decrease our dependency. Yet the Democrats are. as I said. in less than 20 days. are going to put a bill on the floor that is going to increase taxes already on a segment of our economy. We will talk more about that later this evening. If we dont extend those tax cuts that we put in place in 2001 and 2003. you are going to take money right out of the American taxpayers pocket. anywhere from $2.000 to $4.000. right in that middle income of America. That is money that they can save to put away for their childrens college. They can save to put a downpayment on a car. or buy a new washer and dryer. But the most important thing is if we take that money out of the American taxpayers pockets. it will be some bureaucrat deciding how to spend that money. and not an American family. We removed 10.6 million .lowincome Americans from paying taxes in this country all together. We need to make sure that those people stay in that position. that they are not paying taxes when they are low income. We lowered the tax rates on small businesses and employers. the critical employers in our Nation that create the jobs. I hope that those on the other side of the aisle. the Democrats. will take a lesson from history from one of their own. Jack Kennedy. President Kennedy decreased taxes in the 1960s. What happened. there was increased revenue to the Federal Government. President Kennedy in the 1960s did the right thing. As Isaid. the revenues to the United States Government increased.. Ronald Reagan did that in the 1980s. and revenue increased to the Federal Government. Once again. history repeats itself. In 2001 and 2003. we cut taxes and what has happened is the levels of revenue the government has received are at greater levels than ever before in our history. That is what happens when you cut taxes. By raising taxes. all we will do is stifle economic growth in this country. We will take money out of our small businesses. we will take money away from the American taxpayer. Once again. this economy will stop growing. It will stop creating the jobs it has created over the last several years. I know I am joined here tonight by one of my colleagues who is a former small business owner and a former Army Ranger.

I would like to thank my good friend and colleague Congressman CHAmLES HAYES for managing this special order on H.R. 1398. the Income and Jobs Act of 1985. The need for a coordinated and comprehensive Federal economic policy on unemployment is long overdue. and I would like to lend my support to this important legislation. Just about 40 years ago. our Nation made a commitment to attaining maximum employment through the Employment Act of 1946. The law essentially established the Governments responsibility to prevent a second GreatDepression. Of course. it was impossible to know back then that depressions were to be replaced by recurring recessions. These recessions have represented a slow death for the disadvantaged people and minorities in our society. When the business cycle takes a dive. a quick economic fix is pumped in just in time to make the President look good before the next election. and all is well on Main Street U.S.A. Right? Wrong. If you look beyond the facade of the pretty buildings and flower boxes. you will see economic suffering as this country has not seen in many years. Young people. Hispanics. blacks. womenthey all paid the price for shortsighted economic policies that led to what has become a selective recovery. This situation prompted my good friend and colleague Congressman Gus HAWKINS to introduce the Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act of 1978. This bill became law. but. was twisted around so much that it has not accomplished its purpose. So we are essentially in this same sad situation today. It is fashionable to talk about helping the unemployed. but the quick fix has taken its toll. We need a longterm plan for economic justice in this Nation. and we have found one in the Income and Jobs Act of 1985. The bills objectives are simple: it states that every adult American has the right to earn a decent living. and if he or she is willing but unable to work. the right to an adequate income. The Income and Jobs Act is a commonsense piece of legislation. It calls for a coordination of Federal economic policy and mandates a program of implementation. which means the Government needs to get its act together and do some longrange planning with regard to employment opportunity. Things like promoting realistic plans to convert from declining industries to areas where additional services are needed. and more local involvement in planning to avoid corporate or Government concentration of power show the practical approach taken by this legislation. And no additional funding is required. This bill would simply guide existing Federal agencies in establishing policy to carry out the will of the people in a manner beneficial to all the people. The impact of Joblessness on this society is far reaching. the Federal Government has an obligation to do what we can to help. We must think beyond the next few years and consider what the fruit of our actions will be decades from now. Are we going to take the shortterm. easy solution? Or will we act prudently to preserve economic justice for all of our citizens? We do have a choice in this matter. and I believe it is time to close the gap between economic justice and political democracy through our support of the Income and Jobs Act of 1985.0\n',like thank good friend colleague manage special order need coordinated comprehensive federal economic policy unemployment overdue like lend support important legislation year make commitment attain maximum employment law establish government responsibility prevent second greatdepression impossible know depression replace recur recession recession represent slow death disadvantaged people minority society business cycle take dive quick economic fix pump time make look good next election wrong look facade pretty building flower box see economic suffering country see many year young people black pay price shortsighted economic policy lead become selective recovery situation prompt good friend colleague introduce bill become law twist much accomplish purpose same sad situation today fashionable talk help unemployed quick fix take toll need longterm plan economic justice nation find bill objective simple state adult right earn decent_living willing unable work right adequate income commonsense piece legislation call coordination federal economic policy mandate program implementation mean need get act longrange_planning regard employment opportunity thing promote realistic plan convert decline industry area additional service need local involvement plan avoid corporate concentration power show practical approach take legislation additional funding require bill guide exist federal agency establish policy carry will people manner beneficial people impact society reach obligation help think next few year consider fruit action decade go take shortterm easy solution act preserve economic justice citizen choice matter believe time close gap economic justice political democracy support,99.0,daily,0,1

Mr. Lincoln first attracted national attention in the forum of public debate. not alone by reason of his rare ability to express his thoughts in clear and forceful English. but also by reason of the issues he raised. issues which were to culminate in a clash of arms such as had never before occurred on the Western Hemisphere: By temperament Abraham Lincoln was peculiarly fitted to serve as President during such a period as that of the War between the States. God knows that the loss and sorrow which attended that conflict were great enough to cause succeeding generations to mourn. If one possessed of a different temperament from that of Mr. Lincoln had been the Chief Executive of the Nation when Mr. Lincoln served. no human mind can conceive of the sorrow and suffering which might have then occurred and which certainly would have followed the war. It is the fact that Mr. Lincolns great abilities as a debater and as an Executive were overshadowed by his kindliness of disposition and his tender sympathies which will make his name familiar to all the generations of Americans yet to come. Throughout the Southland Mr. Lincoln is loved and respected for the reason that when there came to him the power and opportunity to oppress he proved himself generous and just. in spite of the fact that the forces of vindictiveness and hatred were running riot in the Congress and in many parts of the Nation. Removed as we are from the days in which he lived and served we are apt to forget that while he sat in the White House and listened to the beat of the drums. the thunder of the guns. and the tread of the armies which were advancing for the destruction of the Union. he still hoped and prayed for a composition of those difficulties in such a way as would not only preserve the Union but perpetuate the best traditions and institutions of the South. During that time. when so harassed and so annoyed by mighty problems and great difficulties. he was vexed and annoyed by criticisms and denunciations from those who professed themselves to be his friends and supporters. Those facts and circumstances recall a statement that Mr. Lincoln -made. published in the New York Times under this date. illustrating the necessity for the exercise of temperate judgment and prudence. and for the support of him who. by the choice of the public. had become the leader of the Republic. and I venture to suggest in this solemn presence that his remarks are fitting and appropriate to be repeated in this time. when another sits in the White House charged with the weightiest responsibilities that have been borne by any President since the days of Mr. Lincoln. embarrassed by problems which are new and harassed by snipers firing from under cover. I quote the article in the New York Times referred to: He could say so much in so little. The allegories that flowed from his lips were universal. like the Fables of Aesop. One of them we might well hear today. It came forth when some excited visitors at the White House were chiding him for his conduct of affairs. He listened resignedly. then said: "" Gentlemen. suppose all the property you are worth was in gold. and you had put it into the hands of Blondin to carry across the Niagara River on a rope. Would you shake the cable. or keep shouting to him. Blondin. stand up a little straighter. Blondin. stoop a little more. go a little faster. lean a little more to the north. lean a little more to the south! No. You would hold your breath. as well as your tongue. and keep your hands off until he was safe over."" Mr. President. it is seldom that the contemporaries of a great man can measure with accuracy the value of his achievements. In the centuries to come Mr. Lincolns figure will tower above the level of mediocrity among the gigantic figures of all time. because he served with patience. efficiency. fortitude. and humility in a time of great necessity.\n'",nation people assemble anniversary birthday pay tribute_memory attract national attention forum public debate alone reason rare ability express thought clear forceful reason issue raise issue culminate clash arm such occur temperament fit serve period know loss sorrow attend conflict great cause succeed generation mourn possess different temperament nation serve human mind conceive sorrow suffering occur follow war fact great ability debater overshadow kindliness_disposition tender sympathy make name familiar generation come love respect reason come power opportunity oppress prove generous spite fact force vindictiveness_hatred run riot many part remove day live serve apt forget sit listen beat_drum thunder gun tread army advance destruction hope pray composition difficulty way preserve perpetuate good tradition institution time harass annoyed mighty problem great difficulty vex_annoy criticism denunciation profess friend supporter fact circumstance recall statement -made publish date illustrate necessity exercise temperate judgment prudence support choice public become leader venture suggest solemn presence remark fitting appropriate repeat time sit charge weighty responsibility bear day embarrass problem new harass sniper_fire cover quote article refer say little allegory flow lip universal hear today come excited visitor chide conduct affair listen say gentleman suppose property worth gold put hand carry rope shake cable keep shout blondin stand little straight blondin stoop little more go little lean little more north lean little more south hold breath tongue keep hand safe contemporary great man measure accuracy value achievement century come figure tower level mediocrity gigantic figure time serve patience efficiency fortitude humility time great necessity.\n,73.0,bound,0,1

I rise today in support of H.R. 2297. Within the bill there is a provision which is very special to me personally. Millions of men and women have served honorably in the United States military. One of the promises we make to veterans is that they may be laid to rest in a national cemetery. if they so choose. and that their spouse can be buried with them. Today there are 26 million living United States veterans. Behind each of these veterans Is a husband or wife who has carried a greater burden than most of us ask our husbands or wives to carry. These spouses are just as important to our Nation as the veterans to whom they are. and were. married. But there Is a glitch in the law which denies them their right. as the surviving spouse of a veteran. to be buried In a national cemetery with their husband or wife. in some circumstances. The law also says that if a veterans spouse dies and he or she remarries. both spouses are eligible for burial in a national cemetery. But. if a veteran dies and the spouse remarries a nonveteran. the spouse cant be buried with their first spouse in a national cemetery. It is this problem that this bill. H.R. 2297. seeks to remedy. Kay Brown is a constituent of mine. She told me the story of her mother. Francis Gilkerson. E.T. Gilkerson met and married Kay Browns mother. Francis. some 66 years ago. It was during World War II and E.T. signed up as an enlisted volunteer for the Air Force. He was an XRay technician stationed In Fresno. California. for three years. After he got out of the service. he and Francis were married for 56 years until he died at the age of 84 in Some years went by and Francis met an 80yearold fellow who was also a widower and a neighbor in the mobile home park where they both lived. The two of them were both very lonely and they found comfort and friendship in each others company. Francis was of a generation who would never consider living with somebody unless they were married. She was very concerned that she should be buried with her first husband and did not want to get married for a second time if that right was to be taken away from her. So Kay contacted the local VA on her mothers behalf to check. According to Kay. the VA asked her if her mother and father were still married at the time of his death. The answer was ""yes."" and the VA said that it wouldnt be a problem for Kays mom to be buried at the national cemetery in Santa Fe. Francis married her second husband and lived very happily until her death in September of 2000. When Kay Brown was at the mortuary making arrangements for her mothers cremation. the mortician asked her where she was to be buried. Kay said that she was to be buried at the national cemetery In Santa Fe with her husband of 56 years. The mortician shook his head and said that wasnt possible because her second husband was not a veteran. When Kay called the VA again after her mothers death. they told her that the law prohibited her mother from being buried with her father because she had remarried a nonveteran who was living when Kays mom died. The VA gave Kay the wrong information when she first asked. and their error has caused heartache for Kay and her family. But the prohibition is in the law. The ashes of Kays mother. Francis. are still in a closet at Kays house. But there are thousands of other widows and widowers in the same situation. The law gives the surviving veterans spouse (many of them elderly women) a Hobsons choice: live alone in order to keep your burial right. or give up your right to be buried with your first spouse. to have companionship in your sunset years. H.R. 2297 would allow surviving spouses to remarry and still be buried in a national cemetery with their first spouse if they choose.\n'",rise today support bill provision special million man woman serve military promise make veteran lay rest national cemetery choose spouse bury today live veteran veteran husband_wife carry great burden most ask husband_wife carry spouse important nation veteran marry glitch law deny right surviving_spouse veteran bury national cemetery husband_wife circumstance law say veteran spouse die remarry spouse eligible burial national cemetery veteran die spouse_remarry nonveteran spouse bury first spouse national cemetery problem bill seek remedy constituent tell story mother meet marry mother year sign enlisted volunteer technician station year get service marry year die age year go meet fellow widower neighbor mobile_home park live lonely find comfort friendship other company generation consider live marry concerned bury first husband want get marry second time right take contact local mother behalf check accord ask mother_father marry time death answer say problem kay mom bury national cemetery marry second husband live death mortuary make arrangement mother cremation mortician ask bury say bury national cemetery husband year mortician shake_head say possible second husband veteran call mother death tell law prohibit mother bury father remarry_nonveteran live mom die give wrong information ask error cause heartache family prohibition law ashe kays mother closet house thousand other widow_widower same situation law give survive veteran spouse many elderly woman choice live order keep burial give right bury first spouse companionship sunset year allow survive_spouse remarry bury national cemetery first spouse choose.\n,108.0,daily,1,0

I have reason to believe that he knows what he is talking about sometimes. but in this case I feel that he is mistaken in what he has told the members of this committee on this important piece of legislation. As I stated. I want American labor to do our work in the United States if it is available. There may be unemployed something like 3 million people. scattered over the United States. Back in 1949 when we recommended this legislation and put it through Congress under the leadership of the gentleman from North Carolina there were 4.300.000 unemployed in the United States. and none of them would work on the farms in the areas to do stoop labor which is required. which American citizens will not do. We have had agreements with Mexico. I am hopeful and I am sure that we will have another agreement that will be fair and equitable to our country and Mexico and to the employers of labor. providing not only adequate compensation for the Mexican workers that come into this country but also do justice to the employers of labor and the cost of the program to the Government. We have heard a great deal mentioned about wetbacks. The gentleman from Indiana has referred to this as the wetback bill. This bill seeks to prevent wetbacks from coming into the United States. We want Mexicans to come in legally. Unless this resolution is passed. these Mexicans who want to come into the United States will come in across the Rio Grande River and they will be wetbacks. If we do not pass this resolution. if we do not enact it into law. there will not only not be an agreement. but our country will be flooded with wetbacks. who will be here illegally. Then we will have another problem. to get them out of this country. There has been reference. too. to the fact that a good many Communists come in from Mexico. I do not know if there is any truth to that. there may be some. but they come in as wetbacks. over the Rio Grande River. They do not come in through the legal channels. the legal ports of entry. This resolution seeks to prevent those wetbacks and those Communists from coming into the United States by having the selected men examined by the Immigration Service. both as to their health and as to their character. to determine whether or not they can come into the United States. If they are found to be unreliable. if it is thought that they might do injury to this country. if they are unhealthy. they are not permitted to come into this country. We are hoping that there is going to be an agreement with Mexico. but I can assure you this: Unless this resolution is passed. there will not be any fair agreement with Mexico. It has been said that this bill is used as a blackjack. That has come from the opposition to this legislation. For more than 20 years it has been the policy of our country. up to a year or two ago. to appease every country in the world. to do what they wanted and not what was for the best interests of our country. I think it is high time that we think of the welfare of the American people and have American policies. whether they be bilateral or unilateral. The gentleman from North Carolina has made an impassioned plea to you here today to defeat this legislation. He is mistaken in his opinion. and I am sorry to see it. He has referred to the proceedings of our committee in executive session. which is quite unusual for any member of our committee. He has referred to starchamber sessions. I have sat on this committee longer than has the gentleman from North Carolina or possibly any other man.

Whether or not this bill will be enacted into lawand. if it is. what its final form will behas yet to be decided. but a few conclusions can be drawn from the action that has been taken on it so far. First. there is not even the closest thing to a consensus on just how close we are to the depletion of traditional fossil fuels. Second. there is general agreement that we will someday run out of oil and natural gas. the fuels which we are most dependent on at present. Third. there has been a great deal of rhetoric about the need to develop alternative energy technologies from renewable resources. but. in the final analysis. very little substantive action has been taken. As you know. I have. in the past. questioned the tendency of Federal agencies charged with the development of dependable energy forms to consistently pursue ""totalfix."" centralized. capitaland technologyintensive energy formslike nuclear energywhile almost virtually ignoring some of the more promising forms of energy production from renewable resources which require far less massive infusions of capital and technology. I have been heartened. therefore. by the recent evidence of congressional support for and interest in alcohol fuels. These fuels. of course. can be derived from all sorts of organic renewable materials. ranging all the way from grain to lumber to urban and animal wastes. While it would be wrong to represent alcohol fuels as a panacea. the technology is here today and. with a little farsighted management. alcohol fuels production could go a long way in solving our energy problem. Not only could security of supply be enhanced and our trade deficit reduced. but the use of grains. crop residues. and urban wastes as feedstocks could provide some outlets for these materials whose accumulation imposes costly burdens on our society in the way of disposal and storage. What is more. alcohol fuels can be produced in a more decentralized manner. and are safer and more environmentally sound than the alternatives. The benefits are numerous and the performance has been widely demonstrated. yet we in the United States are really no nearer to the widespread commercial use of alcohol fuels today than we were 50 years ago. There has been little or no stimulus provided or direction given to the development of an alcohol fuels program by those who could haveand should havedone so. Even today. officials in the Department of Energy and elsewhere in the energy buresucracy contend that the technology is still decades away and then turn around and do nothinq more than commission another repetitive study. Powerful grouns. especially the oil companies. have a vested interest in seeing that alcohol fuels production does not become too widespread and they have done much to retard their development. Whatever the reason for the slow pace of alcohol fuels development. there is no question but that those who claim that a significant contribution cannot be made by this energy option are either deluding themselves or are purposefully trying to delude others. A good example of what can be done in this area is going on right now in Brazil. where the Government has set in motion a concerted alcohol fuels production program. By 1980. the Brazilians predict that they will produce $300 million worth of anhydrous alcohol from manioc and sugarcane. Anyone who believes that alcohol fuels production from renewable resources is a technology that only belongs in the future should take a long look at the strides that Brazil has made in the last 5 years. There is no doubt in my mind that. if Brazil can do it. we can do it. Mr. President.

I rise today to lend my support to the amendment to House Resolution 7036. which would direct the National Institute of Arthritis. Metabolism and Digestive Diseases to conduct a study of the safety and effectiveness of DMSO--dimethyl sulfoxide. for use by patients with arthritis. Over 32 million citizens. including 20 million older Americans. suffer from arthritis. Presently the most frequently prescribed pain reliever for the treatment of this disease is aspirin. Arthritis sufferers have long sought a more effective treatment. and many health authorities believe that DMSO is that treatment. Dimethyl sulfoxideDMSO. is a lowcost. easily produced byproduct from the manufacture of paper. which can be rapidly absorbed into the bloodstream when applied to the skin. Advocates of DMSO have said it is a new ""miracle drug."" equal in importance to penicillin or aspirin. opponents argue that it is unproven and ineffective. Doctors. researchers and DMSOusers who appeared before the House Select Committee on Aging. and the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources. described DMSOs effectiveness in reducing the pain. inflammation and stiffness associated with arthritis. bursitis. tendonitis and scleroderma. Despite these claims. there have been no ongoing studies to establish the possible effectiveness of DMSO. in the long term treatment of arthritic diseases. The Food and Drug Administration refuses approval of DMSO. because it has insufficient scientific data. This situation is unacceptable to the millions of Americans. who suffer from arthritis. and the thousands who go abroad each year for DMSO treatments or pay exorbitant prices for DMSO here in the United States. However. within the United States the drug is already available legally in Oregon and Florida. What is necessary is an objective evaluation so that the value of DMSO for use by arthritis sufferers can be established conclusively. This amendment. sponsored by Congressman CLAUDE PEPPER and LARRY HOPKINS. would require the National Institute on Arthritis to conduct appropriate tests and report back to Congress within a year. The cost involved in conducting such a study would be a fraction of the national research commitment. while the proportional benefits are enormous. When this proposal was introduced as House Resolution 7023. more than 100 Members of the House cosponsored it. By funding this study we will learn definitely about the benefits of DMSO and we may be able to provide a lowcost. effective relief to the millions of Americans who now suffer from chronic pain due to arthritis.*\n'",rise today lend support amendment direct conduct study safety effectiveness dimethyl sulfoxide use patient arthritis citizen include old suffer arthritis prescribe pain_reliever treatment disease aspirin arthritis_sufferer seek effective treatment many health authority believe treatment lowcost produce byproduct manufacture paper absorb_bloodstream apply skin advocate say new miracle drug equal importance penicillin_aspirin opponent argue unproven ineffective doctor researcher dmsouser appear describe dmso_effectiveness reduce pain inflammation_stiffness associate arthritis scleroderma claim ongoing study establish possible effectiveness long term treatment arthritic disease refuse approval insufficient scientific datum situation unacceptable million suffer arthritis thousand go year treatment pay exorbitant price drug available necessary objective evaluation value use arthritis_sufferer establish amendment sponsor require conduct appropriate test report year cost involve conduct study fraction national research commitment proportional benefit enormous proposal introduce more member cosponsor fund study learn benefit able provide lowcost effective relief million suffer chronic_pain arthritis.*\n,96.0,bound,0,1

I am pleased to join with my colleagues in a colloquy to clarify the actions taken by the Budget Committee regarding the alcohol fuels program administered by the Department of Energy. First. let me state unequivocally that I support the Presidents efforts to reduce Federal spending. We have gone far too long before placing curbs on Federal spending. ! i Reagan administration came with mandate from the people of this Nation to bring spending under control. The process we are undergoing today is a first step taken by the Congress to join in the administrations efforts to reduce the size and scope of the Federal budget. During consideration of recommendations to the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. I offered a motion to include $270 million for the DOE alcohol fuels program. This motion was defeated by a slim onevote margin. The committee then voted in favor of a motion by Senator KASSEBAUM which dealt with the financing of the strategic petroleum reserve. Considering the slimness of the margin by which my motion failed and the fact that some Senators could have voted against my motion in order to support the proposal on the strategic petroleum reserve. I join in this colloquy to establish support for the DOE alcohol fuels program. It was just last year that Congress adopted the Energy Security Act. It has been less than 1 year that this measure has been enacted. Yet given the serious nature of our energy situation. the Congress wrote language Into the measure that would insure the Department of Energy act expeditiously on the alcohol fuels program. Within 1 month solicitations would have to be made and a decision on the applications within 120 days. The alcohol fuels program. as found in title II of the Energy Security Act. Is slated to achieve a production level of 60.000 barrels per day of alcohol from biomass by the end of 1982. The Department of Energy was given jurisdiction over biomass projects that produce over 15 million gallons per year. The assistance offered by this title was to take the form primarily in loan guarantees. In addition. projects must meet certain requirements in order to be eligible for consideration for loan guarantees. Applicants must meet a creditelsewhere test and they must also bear a reasonable degree of risk. Priority was to be given to those not using petroleum or natural gas as process fuels and to those applying new teelmologies. Mr. President. the magnitude of these projects has not been tried before and they do present a financial risk to the private money markets. The tax credits that are available to alcohol fuels. which I support. may not be enough for projects of this capacity. Furthermore. Congress -directed the Department of Energy to act with speed because we cannot afford to waste time in developing domestic energy sources. In October of 1980. just 5 months ago. DOE selected an initial seven projects to begin negotiations for loan guarantees. From these initial seven projects. 263 million gallons of ethanol would be produced. which if blended with gasoline would yield . more than 2.6 billion gallons of gasohol. Later an additional nine projects were chosen. however. one dropped out. All of these 15 projects have made some degree of financial commitment. because the law states that applicants must assume a reasonable degree of risk. Engineering plans and design studies have been undertaken. The cost of building the initial seven projects alone will run over $500 million. with several millions of dollars in private funds having already been spent. While contractual obligations have not been made. by passing the Energy Security Act. Congress made a public policy decision that it wanted to see alcohol fuels developed and developed quickly. The administrations recommendation to terminate the alcohol fuels program is reneging on the policy decision made last year by Congress and carried out by the Department of Energy. I respectfully urge the distinguished members of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee to weigh carefully the recommendations of the President and the Budget Committee with regard to the alcohol fuels program. Finally. I thank the Senator from Minnesota for the opportunity to join in this colloquy on the DOE alcohol fuels program.*\n',pleased join colleague colloquy clarify action take regard alcohol_fuel program administer let state support effort reduce federal spending go long place curb federal spending administration come mandate people nation bring spending control process undergo today first step take join administration effort reduce size scope budget consideration recommendation offer motion include alcohol_fuel program motion defeat slim_onevote margin committee vote favor motion deal financing strategic_petroleum reserve consider slimness margin motion fail fact senator vote motion order support proposal strategic_petroleum reserve join colloquy establish support alcohol_fuel program last year adopt less year measure enact give serious nature energy situation write language measure insure act alcohol_fuel program month solicitation make decision application day alcohol_fuel program find title slate achieve production level barrel day alcohol biomass end give jurisdiction biomass project produce gallon year assistance offer title take form loan guarantee addition project meet certain requirement order eligible consideration loan guarantee applicant meet creditelsewhere_test bear reasonable degree risk priority give use petroleum natural_gas process fuel apply new teelmologie magnitude project try present financial risk private money market tax credit available alcohol_fuel support enough project capacity -directe act speed afford waste time develop domestic energy source month select initial project begin negotiation loan guarantee initial project gallon_ethanol produce blend_gasoline yield more gallon_gasohol additional project choose drop project make degree financial commitment law state applicant assume reasonable degree risk engineering plan design study undertake cost build initial project run several million_dollar private fund have spend contractual_obligation make pass make public policy decision want see alcohol_fuel develop develop administration recommendation terminate alcohol_fuel program renege policy decision make last year carry urge distinguished member weigh recommendation regard alcohol_fuel program thank opportunity join colloquy alcohol_fuel program.*\n,97.0,daily,1,0

I oppose the amendment of the Senator from Mississippi. As I understand. it provides. first. that before a strike can be ordered. a committee composed of representatives of labor and representatives of the employer shall conduct the strike vote. This matter came before the Senate last year on an amendment offered by the then Senator from Connecticut. Mr. Purtell. There was so little support for the amendment that it was defeated on a voice vote. The reason for its defeat on a voice vote is the very reason why this amendment was not included in the TaftHartley Act. From 1944 to the end of 1946. under the SmithConnally Act. strike ballots. comparable to the kind suggested by the Senator from Mississippi. were in effect. The experience showed that it cost more than $2 million to conduct a strike ballot in 19461 yearand that more than 90 percent of all the votes cast did not support the strike. This was in a time of war. I point out. The ballot was worded: ""I am in favor of stopping all war production by voting in favor of a strike."" In other words. the amendment was worded in such a way that the burden would be very heavy upon the striker before he would ever agree to call a strike. Nevertheless. under those conditions. even under the pressure of wartime. which certainly should have mitigated against careless consideration. 90 percent of all the ballots voted were against a strike. Senator Taft felt that such a provision made it more difficult to reach an accommodation. Unions. in order to win strikes. have always held back the very last vote until they could be certain of the outcome. Then they go to the employer and say. ""We are not able to make any new concessions. Our members are ready to strike."" So instead of making for a happier relationship between labor and management. it made the relationship worse. That is the reason why the Secretary of Labor. Mr. Mitchell. has opposed this provision. I read from his testimony of last year before the committee: Secretary MITCHELL. From the point of view of management. I would think that management would not like to see a strike vote legislated. because a management negotiator will be confronted by a union negotiator saying to him. ""Look. I have no discretion in this matter. I cannot make any compromise in our demands. because the Federal Government has taken a strike vote. and my membership by a majority vote says I have to get what I could by asking for it right now."" Therefore Secretary Mitchell opposed the provision.

I shall vote against the pending bill which would authorize the expenditure of $900 million by the President during the next year. for loans and grantsinaid to the various States and communities where it would be spent. This is a blankcheck proposal and is a WPAtype measure. The money can be used for a multitude of purposes. with Uncle Sam paying for up to 75 percent of the cost. The committee which reported the bill gave as its purpose the following: The purpose of H.R. 10113. as reported. is (1) to establish the Office of Public Works Coordination and Acceleration to meet the longrange need of public works planning. and (2) to authorize an appropriation of $900 million to accelerate the construction of public works to overcome the present problem of unemployment. Since the purpose is to achieve a longrange objective. we can assume that the $900 million authorization is but the beginning of a new depressiontype outlay of Federal funds which will probably go on for years. I can hardly think of a single project of this nature that was proposed as a temporary thing which did not continue for years. From reading the committee report it appears that Mr. George Meany. president of the AFLCIO. testified that each $1 million of construction expenditures will create about 100 onsite. offsite jobs and about 150 other jobs in consumer industries and in wholesale and retail trades for a period of 1 year. or a total of approximately 250 jobs for 1 year. Thus. some 50.000 onsite and offsite jobs and 75.000 additional Jobs in consumer industries and wholesale and retail trades. or a total of 125.000 jobs. would be created during the peak fiscal year of 1963 and would continue during most of fiscal year 1964. As of last May there were 3.719.000 persons unemployed. This represents between 4 and 5 percent of the labor force. Thus. the new jobs this bill can be expected to create will only scratch the surface in attempting to solve the alleged unemployment problem in this country. Mr. Chairman. the Congress recently raised the ceiling on the national debt. We had a large deficit last year. and we are due to have another deficit this year. of probably $6 to $8 billion. This bill will add to that deficit. This welfare measure is but one of many this Congress has approved this year or is now being asked to approve. There is admittedly no national emergency to justify this type of expenditure. It is high time the Congress think in terms of reducing rather than increasing the cost of Government. This measure may properly be described as the granddaddy of all boondoggles. It is in my judgment bad legislation. unnecessary and wholly unjustified.

I desire to add a few words. Of course. no one desires to make this attempt of the Government to float a very large loan a means of profit to particular banks. We all understand as well as the Senator from Massachusetts that what we are trying to do is to get money with which to meet the present urgent demands of the Government. and that all classes of citizens. all kinds of financial institutions. will be asked to invest in the securities of the Government. but when once that money has been secured the question comes as to its disposition.

It seemed to me. therefore. that we ought not to. depart from the policy we have hitherto followed. namely. that the Government should at least encourage its own system by continning to conduct its fiscal transactions through that system.

C. has made it possible for solvent banks to be safe depositories of the peoples money. the question might be asked of Mr. SNELL why he thinks it would be better if the R. F.

F. C. lists actual disbursements as $2.027.064.236 in the Hoover administration and $4.821.008.987 since that time.

This editorial is captioned ""Erosion of Character."" Let me quote from the editorialIn his St. Louis address Thomas E. Dewey accused the administration of ""a fundamental lack of integrity. a cynical disregard of the principles of common honesty."" These are harsh charges. But they have been made before. Listen to this statement made by the venerable Democratic Senator from Virginia [CARTER GLASS]. who unwaveringly. unafraid. has served the great State of Virginia in the United States Senate for so long. who has eyes to see. a mind to analyze. and the courage to state the fact. Long before Mr. Dewey began his campaign the Senator said: The New Deal. taken all in all. is not only a mistake. it is a disgrace to the Nation. and the time is not far distant when we shall be ashamed of having wandered so far from the dictates of common sense and common honesty. Here we have the young crusading racketbuster from the city of New York and the grayhaired patriotic sage of the Senate characterizing the present administration as lacking truthfulness and honesty. without which no nation can prosper and continue to exist. This editorial then continuesBut Mr. Dewey did not stop at generalizations. He went ahead to cite instance after instance of broken pledges. renewed promises. and fresh breaches of faith. Thus he noted the Presidents repudiation of the gold standard soon after his election upon a platform advocating a ""sound currency. and his repeated promises to balance the Budget. ending with conversion to a spending theory which associates budgetbalancing with disaster. Mr. Dewey also passed in review the administrations attempt to ""undermine the Constitution""-notably the proposal to pack the Supreme Court. and subsequent unsuccessful efforts to effect a ""political purge"" of the lawmakers who had opposed the Court.packing plan. It is not an adequate answer to say that platform promises are made only to be broken. And there is a certain speciousness about the familiar argument that unforeseen emergencies justify lightninglike changes of policy. Mr. Deweys target is obviously the President himself. And the latters record is unquestionably vulnerable. because of the multiplicity of broken pledges that could have been kept without danger to the national welfare. From the foregoing quotation you will note that the editorial does not question the soundness of Deweys indictment. its truthfulness. nor does it charge that Deweys recital of the facts did not carry conviction of that charge. The editorial rather seeks by confession an avoidance to excuse the lack of truthfulness and the lack of common honesty shown by the Presidents administration Of his office up to this time. This attempted palliation of the lack of moral fiber in the present administration is given in these wordsagain I quote from the Post: Despite the vigor of the St. Louis speech it is questionable whether a recital of this sort will arouse any great amount of indignation. The fact is that the ""erosion of character"" of which Mr. Dewey complains In the National Government is paralleled in private life. Indeed. it is probable that the vacillation which characterizes our governmental policies is a reflection of the groping of bewildered individuals for a solution of the numerous social and economic problems that now affect their daily lives. Here is an indictment not of the administration but of the American people as a whole and of this Congress in particular. Note again this sentence. from the editorial: Despite the vigor of the St. Louis speech it is questionable whether a recital of this sort will arouse any great amount of indignation. What is the implication from that statement? It is this: That notwithstanding candidate Roosevelts statement thatWe believe that a party platform is a covenant with the people to be faithfully kept by the party when entrusted with power. and that the people are entitled to know in plain words the terms of a contract to which they are asked to subscribe. he has seen fit. because of political expediency. to so often violate his solemn promises to the American people that they have become accustomed to the thought that truthfulness is no longer expected from the Chief Executive of the Nation.

But the implementation of those promises has been so sterile that they are becoming increasingly discouraged and almost hopeless. They feel that we have been making a great many promises. but have been falling down in the performance of such promises. During the 1952 campaign a glowing prospect for liberation was held out to the people of the enslaved countries by the Republican Party. After the election. those promises were completely forgotten and discarded by the candidates who had been elected to highest office. It is not surprising that they were abandoned. Obviously. they were merely insincere campaign pledges. Certainly no steps whatsoever have been taken to carry them out. Since that time1952in an evergrowing degree. the feeling of disillusionment in the countries which are captive behind the Iron Curtain has grown to such an extent that today the people living in those enslaved countries are virtually hopeless. The amendment which has been offered by the Senator from Illinois makes no promises which are unattainable. It holds out no prospects of achievement that cannot be realized. It does not urge revolt at this time. It does strongly hold out hope. It does give assurance to the enslaved people of the continued interest and sympathy of the American people. and of their intention to do everything possible to maintain and foster the spirit of liberty which we have ever held to be the dearest possession of any democratic nation. We pray with all our hearts that the enjoyment of liberty will soon again become an achieved fact in the countries behind the Iron Curtain and we intend to do what we can to bring that happy day about. The enslaved countries who will be affected by this amendment have large populations. They have been freedomloving peoples for generationsin some for centuriesalthough in many cases they were unhappily deprived of their liberties at different times. However. the torch of liberty. the hope of freedom. and the determination to attain freedom and liberty again. even at the risk of death. have never been extinguished. They have always remained bright in the face of the greatest and most tragic discouragement. Lithuania. Latvia. Estonia. Poland. Czechoslovakia. Rumania. Hungary. Albania. and others were all countries which have fought and made indescribable sacrifices for the preservation of their liberty over generations. yet today they are enslaved people. without any real hope of early liberation. Their slender hope will ever grow weaker unless it is encouraged by their friends in the West and it must be encouraged not merely with words. but with deeds. I have known many of the leaders of the captive countries. I worked closely with many of them during the war years from 1939 to 1945. I have since talked with many of them who are today in exile in this country. or abroadwith some of them I have spoken only a few days ago.

I move to strike the requisite number of words. Mr. Chairman. the situation. as I understand it. is this. The Bolling committee recommended a guarantee to every full committee of an increise in staff of a dozen or soguaranteed. That is a laudable position. Similarly. the Hansen committee recommended a guarantee under the House rules reaching an equivalent result. where in each subcommittee chairman had a guarantee. and each ranking Member had a guarantee to have a staffer of equal salary. We did this to avoid the majority partys concern and the concern of a number of junior Members that by giving the minority onethird. if you will. they would most likely be placed in the hands of the ranking Republican on the full committee. some of it may or may not trickle down to those who have the job responsibility at the subcommittee level. So in this sense. the Bolling suggestion and the Hansen suggestion were alike on their premises that this additional staff should be guaranteed. but varied in their terms of implementation. Hansen position supports added staffing at the subcommittee level and minority matching at the ranking subcommittee report level. The proposal before us eliminates that guarantee. It changes the whole staff matching right back to the noblesse oblige of some very dear friends of mine on the House Administration Committee.

I again desire to call the attention of the Senate to the fact that during this Congress nothing of a constructive character has been done for the farmer. The plight of the agricultural regions is most acute. Reports from counties in my State. Nebraska. indicate that the farmers are receiving in some sections such prices as 27 cents per bushel for wheat. 19 cents per bushel for corn. from 13 to 18 cents per pound for butterfat. 9 cents per pound for chickens. 6 cents per dozen for eggs. and even in western Iowa $3.15 per 100 pounds for hogs. This means that the farmer is receiving less than onehalf for his products as compared with average prices for the period from 1909 to 1914. but. mark you. he is paying for the things he buys from 15 to 20 per cent more than he paid during that same period. and it is not by any means all due to the existing depression. No improvement in economic conditions generally can be expected so long as such a differential prevails against the farmer. That must be evident. because the buying power of the whole rural populationnearly onehalf of our populationis practically the same as that of the farmer. because of the prevailing prices for agricultural products. Not only has this Congress failed to act constructively for the farmer. but there is no measure of such a character pending on the calendar of the Senate. What are we going to do about it? Only a little more than one month remains of this session. Are we to go back and tell the farmer we are helpless or that we could not even attempt legislation? Certainly such answers will not suffice. and I give warning here that such is the case. Such answers will be resented. No other result can be expected. -\n',desire call attention fact constructive character do farmer plight agricultural region acute report county indicate farmer receive section such price cent_bushel wheat cent_bushel corn cent_pound butterfat cent_pound chicken cent dozen_egg western pound hog mean farmer receive less onehalf product compare average price period mark pay thing buy per_cent more pay same period mean due exist depression improvement economic condition expect differential prevail farmer evident buying power whole rural onehalf populationis same farmer prevail price agricultural product fail act farmer measure character pende calendar go little more month remain session go tell farmer helpless attempt legislation such answer suffice give warning such case such answer resent other result expect,72.0,bound,1,0

I thank the gentlewoman for joining us for this debate. I appreciate her leadership in the freshman class. It is very interesting that you would use this metaphor of a shell game. because that is exactly what the Democrats are .trying to do with the American people. Because again. the spending that it is going to take to relieve the human suffering on the gulf coast can only come from one of three places. Either we are going to pass debt on to our children. we are going to engage in massive tax increases on the American people. or we are going to ask the Federal budget not to grow quite as fast. to get rid of some of the fraud. to get rid of some of the waste. to get rid of the lowerpriority spending. What they -want to make sure in their shell game is that they never show the American people the massive tax increases they are planning. They have planted seeds in our socalled entitlement spending that American people are not going to be able to afford. Their tax plan just grows and grows and grows. Again. Mr. Speaker. what is going to happen for the next generation? For the Democrats to fund all of their programs. when they refuse to work with us. and we have invited them to work with us to help reform some of this entitlement spending. if they do not work with us. this is the future our children and grandchildren are facing. massive and massive tax increases. We will be on the verge of being perhaps the first generation to leave our children a lower standard of living. We are going to have to double taxes on the American people just to balance the budget in 30 years if we do not do something to restrain the growth of Government. And again. as I showed earlier. how much Government should we have? Already in just the last 10 years. we have seen that the Federal budget has outpaced the family budget by over a full third. Mr. Speaker. is there any reason why we should have the Federal budget outpace the family budget by over a third? Ultimately all of this sp~ndifig has to be paid for. Mr. Speaker. all this spending is not created equal. I mean. too often we hear from those on the other side of the aisle that any time we try to restrain the growth of spending. that somehow we are hurting the poor. Well. I am here to tell you. Mr. Speaker. compassion for the poor is not.measured by the number of government checks you send out. it is measured by the number of jobs you create so that the American people can go out and re-. alize their American dream. * And- when we have had tax relief. not only. not only. Mr. Speaker. have we received greater tax revenues. the deficit has come down. but what we have also seen is millions and millions of Americans. 4 million new jobs created from tax relief. Now. Mr. Speaker. when we look at the Federal budget and we look at this spending. sometimes many good things come from it: Kevlar vests for our brave men and women fighting in the war on terror. student loans for many needy folks who otherwise might not have an opportunity to go to college. But all too often we also see a Medicare who will pay five times as much for a wheelchair as the VA did simply because one would competitively bid. and the other would not. We see $800 spent on an. outhouse in a national park. and the toilet does not even flush. $800.000. We see millions and millions of dollars spent for an indoor rain forest in the State of Iowa. and the list goes on and on and on. Mr. Speaker. the American people just do not believe there is not waste. fraud. abuse and duplication in the Federal budget. For example. we have 342 economic development programs. We have 130 programs serving the disabled. 90 early childhood early development programs. The list goes on and on. How much duplication do we need? And yet the Democrats want to raise taxes to pay for more of this. The Federal Government made at least $20 billion in overpayments in 2001. The Department of Housing and Urban Development spent 3.3 billion. 10 percent of their budget in q001. on overpayments. yet Democrats want to raise our taxes to pay for more of this. The Advanced Technology Programs spends $150 million annually subsidizing private businesses. 40 percent of which goes to Fortune 500 companies. and yet Democrats want to raise our taxes to pay for more of this. And there are so many reforms that we can institute in this body that could. for example. brings us greater health care at a cheaper cost. If we would pass meaningful medical liability reform. we would bring down the cost of health care 5 to 10 percent in. America. Medicaid could save $1.5 billion a year if they would base their drug payments on actual acqiuisition costs. They could save 2 to $3 billion a year if they would stop improper payments to States that use that money for purposes other than Medicaid. and the list goes on and on. We can find the reforms. but we must start this process of reconciliation. which. again. when we look at $62 billion of savings we are trying to find in a 5year $13.9 trillion budget. that is a half a cent. That is one half of one penny. Mr. Speaker. that we are trying to find so that our children do not face massive tax increases as far as the eye can see. guaranteeing to lower their standard of living. Mr. Speaker. this really comes down to two visions for America: one helping empower people. helpiig them realize their American Dream. about them going out. starting new jobs. It is really about a vision of less government and more freedom. Yet our friends on the other side on the aisle who will not work with us on reconciliation. who will not work with us to root.out this waste and this fraud and abuse. who only want to continue with more spending and more spending and more spending. they believe nothing good happens in America unless it comes from the Federal Government. Well. a lot of good things come from the American family. A lot of good things come from the free enterprise system. That is what we. need to strengthen. In the days to come. Mr. Speaker. that is what this debate is all about. those who want to restrain the growth of the Federal budget so the family budget can expand and- those who only want to grow government and impose massive tax increases on our children and grandchildren as far as the eye can see. Mr. Speaker. there is no doubt that when the American people will look at this. ultimately they will chose less. government and more freedom.\n',thank gentlewoman join debate appreciate leadership freshman_class interesting use metaphor shell_game .trye american people spending go take relieve human_suffering coast come place go pass debt child go engage massive tax increase american people go ask budget grow get_rid fraud get_rid waste get_rid lowerpriority spending -want make sure shell_game show american people massive tax increase plan plant seed socalled entitlement spending american people go able afford tax plan grow grow grow go happen next generation fund program refuse work invite work help reform entitlement spending work future child_grandchild face massive massive tax increase verge first generation leave child low standard_living go double taxis american people balance budget year restrain growth show much government last year see federal budget outpace family budget full third reason budget outpace family budget third sp_~ ndifig pay spending create equal mean hear other side_aisle time try restrain growth spending hurt poor tell compassion poor not.measure number government check send measure number job create american people go alize american dream tax relief receive great tax revenue deficit come see million million new job create tax relief look budget look spending many good thing come kevlar_vest brave man woman fight war terror student loan many needy folk opportunity go college see pay time much wheelchair bid other see spend outhouse national park toilet_flush see million million_dollar spend indoor rain_forest list go american people believe waste_fraud abuse duplication budget example economic development program program serve disabled early_childhood early development program list go much duplication need want raise taxis pay more make overpayment spend percent budget overpayment want raise taxis pay more spend subsidize private business percent go company want raise taxis pay more many reform institute body example bring great health_care cheap cost pass meaningful medical liability reform bring cost health_care percent save year base drug payment actual acqiuisition cost save year stop improper payment use money purpose other list go find reform start process reconciliation look saving try find budget half cent half penny try find child face massive tax increase eye see guarantee lower standard_living come vision help empower people helpiig realize american go start new job vision less government more freedom friend other side_aisle work reconciliation work root.out waste_fraud abuse want continue more spending more spending more spending believe good happen come lot good thing come american family lot good thing come free_enterprise system need strengthen day come debate want restrain growth budget family budget expand and- want grow government impose massive tax increase child_grandchild eye see doubt american people look choose less government more freedom.\n,109.0,daily,1,0

I think it is well to have the rules defined precisely for this purpose. The Chair has ruled that any amendment which was proposed to the original bill need not be reintroduced to have it considered as an amendment to the substitute bill. The most important changes in the bill are in title II. dealing with public accommodations. and title VII. which prohibits discrimination in employment. The changes in these titles parallel each other. For the most part the changes are concerned with the enforcement provisions of the two titles. Provisions have been inserted in both titles to give States which have public accommodations laws or fair employment practices laws. as the case may be. a reasonable opportunity to act under State law before the commencement of any Federal proceedings by individuals who allege discrimination. In the public accommodations title the State has 30 days to act. In the equal employment opportunity title the State has 60 days to act. this period is lengthened to 120 days during the first year the State law is in effect. I may add that there is provided a period of 1 years grace before any provisions of title VII will go into effect. In States which do not have public accommodations laws a person aggrieved by such discrimination may seek relief in the Federal courts immediately. The court may. in its discretion. refer his case to the Community Relations Service for a limited period for an attempt at voluntary settlement of the alleged discrimination. In States where there is no fair employment practices legislation the aggrieved individual may file a complaint immediately with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. If the procedures before the Commission are unsuccessful. the complainant may seek relief in the Federal courts. The court may appoint an attorney for him and may authorize the payment of attorneys fees and court costs. Furthermore. the Attorney General may intervene in the case. with the permission of the court. The Attorney General is given authority to sue under title II or title VII whenever ""he has reasonable cause to believe that any person or group of persons is engaged in a pattern or practice of resistance to the full enjoyment of any of the rights"" secured by either title. Now let me turn to a more detailed discussion of these and other changes which have been made in the proposed substitute.

Mr. Chairman. I understand the sentiments expressed by the gentleman from North Carolina. The gentleman from Maryland and I and others on both sides of the aisle in this body have worked very hard over the last couple of years to try to depoliticize the issue of Members pay. This body did that. as a matter of fact. several years ago when we established a procedure whereby the increases. the cost of living adjustments in the salaries received by Members of this body. would be tied to that of other Federal employees. but with half a percent less than they would get. So we would never get the same amount as another Federal employee was getting. The idea was to take it out of the process of forcing us to have votes on this one at a time. to have the gutwrenching vote as to whether or not we should receive a pay increase. That process was established in law and we had. I believe. every hope that that process would work. Unfortunately. Members have realized that the rules of this House permit other ways of getting at a vote on the Members pay raise. even when there is not really an increase in the pay. that we are talking simply about a cost of living adjustment. So we have had this process. unfortunately. on this bill for too many years. It does not really belong at all on this legislation. We have had this provision added in on several years which would prevent Members from receiving the cost of living adjustment that other Federal employees have gotten. In the strongest possible terms I deplore the use of this issue by anybody on either side of the aisle. Members ought to be allowed to consider this in the least politically obtrusive way possible. We ought to be able to consider this on its merits. Unfortunately. when we have Members and it has happened. I would remind the gentleman from North Carolina. on both sides of the aisle in the past who have attacked the cost of living adjustment for Members. it becomes. especially in an election year. a very difficult issue for Members to withstand what they perceive to be the heat that they will receive at home on this issue. Therefore. this year. it was very clear from the statements that had been made in both the House and the Senate that there was going to be an effort made to make sure that Members did not get a cost of living adjustment. It was the decision of the subcommittee that we simply put that decision into the bill before it got to the floor of the House. And that is why we see this provision in the legislation. and that is why the rule. which was adopted last night. protects this particular provision. I wish that we did not have to go through this debate. I wish we did not have to have this kind of provision in the legislation but. nonetheless. it is there. It is. I think. the decision of the leadership on both sides of the aisle that we will not subject the Members to a vote on a cost of living adjustment. and I would certainly urge my colleagues to vote against the gentlemans amendment and leave this provision intact in the legislation when it leaves the House of Representatives.\n',rise opposition amendment understand sentiment express gentleman gentleman other side_aisle body work last couple year try depoliticize issue member pay body matter fact several year establish procedure increase cost living adjustment salary receive member body tie other federal employee percent less get get same amount employee get idea take process force vote one time gutwrenching vote receive pay increase process establish law believe hope process work member realize rule permit other way get vote pay raise increase pay talk cost live adjustment process bill many year belong legislation provision add several year prevent member receive cost live adjustment other federal employee get strong possible term deplore use issue side_aisle member allow consider least obtrusive way possible able consider merit member happen remind gentleman side_aisle past attack cost live adjustment become election year difficult issue member withstand perceive heat receive home issue year clear statement make go effort make make sure member get cost live adjustment decision subcommittee put decision bill get floor see provision legislation rule adopt last night protect particular provision wish go debate wish kind provision legislation think decision leadership side_aisle subject member vote cost live adjustment urge colleague vote amendment leave provision intact legislation leave,105.0,daily,1,0

How do we know which bases to close if we do not know what the force structure is going to be? That Is the first thing to consider. Let us get the force structure. Then we invite the Secretary of Defense to propose what he thinks is fair. and then we come up with a bill that we promise will do it. Attacking this committee and saying that they have not been closing bases is absolutely wrong. This committee has moved forward with the 86 bases that were on the closure list. Not a single one has fallen off the list that came up under the Commission proposal that this Congress backed. This committee also put into the bill $100 billion to expedite the closing of those 86 bases. What we are saying is that the difference between those 86 bases selected by the Commission and these recent bases that were done by the Presidents appointee. the Secretary of Defense. is very apparent. We had long hearings looking at the January list that came over to us. These were done unilaterally and not done in a bipartisan fashion. We asked the Services. ""How did you get these names? Where did you get these bases? How did you make these decisions?"" Their answer to every one of those questions was ""We dont know. We dont know. We dont know."" So obviously the decisions about which of the bases were put on the closure list that came out this January did not come from the services. they came from the Secretary of Defense. Mr. Chairman.

I occupy on this question a different position from either side of the House. I have no fear of an influx of silver into this country from abroad. and. though I recognize but one standard. gold. as the most precious metal. I do not believe that it is a necessary deduction therefrom that we should demonetize silver. My objection to this bill lies both in detail and in gross. My objection to it is that it is a bill not to increase but to restrict the circulation of silver. and that is the title. if we had consulted common sense. we would have~given it. It is a bill to throw more ragged notes upon the country. to pile up silver in the Treasury. and not to place it in the hands of the people. Today you can scarcely get a half dollar or a quarter that i1 not worn. and if you were to coin $100.000.000 more of these subsidiary coins it would remain in the Treasury under this principle of action and not go into the hands of the people. My objections to this bill are these: First. it is a subsidy to the silver kings of the West. and. as a Democrat. I am opposed to any subsidy. sugar coat the pill as you may. That is my first and primary objection. But I have another. That other objection is in behalf of the planters of the South and the farmers of the West. to whom this bill threatens disaster and financial ruin. I suppose no gentleman in this House has written more than I have on farming. or probably knows less about it. What I dont know about farming would occupy volumes. But I come of a race of farmdrs.

I have an interest in the farmers of this country. especially when I know that for years past they have been fighting at a disadvantage and at a positive and continual loss. last years extraordinary crop being the only exception. For years they have been compelled to borrow at ruinous rates of interest. They have come and tempted the capitalists of Wall street and the North with 8 and 10 per cent interest. which no farmer should pay and no farmer can pay. and having got it. now comes this bill. which is said to be a debtors bill to enable the farmers and the planters of this country to pay 70 cents on the dollar in satisfaction of their debts. I call it. in plain language. the swindlers bill. Let me tell you. Mr. Speaker. this is not only to pay the creditors. but to pay the men who labor on those magnificent sheep and cattle ranches of the West and the cotton plantations of the South. What will be the result practically to the farmer? You propose to pay his mortgage in silver. Where then will he get the money if he can not pay the interest when it accrues? Where can he get the money to pay the principal? By borrowing it. and borrowing it from the very man that this bill assails. or its advocates assail. and who will dictate to him the terms of the contract. You are. if you pass this billand thank God if it passes this House and the camel gets through the needles eye of the Senate. it will meet with a bar elsewherebut if you pass the bill you are creating the greatest injustice and ruin to the farmers and planters of the country. and they will curse the authors of the bill to their beards. I remember once in the Gestae Romanorum. I think compiled by the monks in the old days. of the barber who was engaged to cut the throat of the king when he shaved him. but happening to look at the towel in the room he found on it the words: ""Before beginning consider well the end."" He stopped. for he knew what the end would be to him. These gentlemen in favor of this bill should consider the end before they begin to act. And let me tell you that although you may pay in the South or in the West their workmen. their laborers in depreciated currency. for that is what it would mean to them and you know it . if they undertake to do that let me tell them that they can not pay in that way the wageearners of my district or of the North. You must reflect that every year the laboring class. the mechanical classes. the laborers of the North have been struggling with the wolf at the door. The toiling masses have been trampled down again and again in the past. and now you propose at the dictate of the silver kings of the West. you propose to put them now under a depreciated currency. but let me tell you. Mr. Speaker. that they know their strength. and that the blind Samson of the masses if he once grasps the pillars of the temple will bring down the fabric upon his head and yours as well in one common ruin. You can not tamper with a great question like this. or deal with the people in that way. I have been a Democrat for fiftythree years. through storm and sunshine. at all times and places. a Democrat. and here in my old age. the oldest man but one in this House.

I believe there is a pending amendment. which hopefully we will vote on. called the McConnell amendment. It basically takes away from the Environmental Protection Agency the authority to regulate greenhouse gases. The Environmental Protection Agency gets this power from a Supreme Court decision that said they had the authority to do so. That decision was about 2 or 3 years ago. It came about 16 or 17 years after the 1990 Clean Air Act was passed. Those of us who were around here and debated and worked on the Clean Air Act of 1990 dont remember any discussion about EPA under that legislation having the authority to regulate greenhouse gases. but obviously the Supreme Court read the law differently than we intended. The Environmental Protection Agency was told it could regulate greenhouse gases. The Environmental Protection Agency did not have to do that. but I suppose they are like regulators. generally. Some ask: Why do cows moo? Why do pigs squeal? And why do regulators regulate? Because regulators know how to regulate. and that is all they know how to do. So they are going to issue a regulation if they think they have the authority. The situation is this: If we dont take away the authorityand in a sense overturn the Supreme Court caseEPA is going to put us in a position of being economically uncompetitive with the rest of the world. particularly in manufacturing. When you increase the cost of energy by anywhere from $1.800. under one study. to $3.000. under another study. per household. you are very dramatically increasing the cost of manufacturing. If we are worried about too many manufacturing jobs going overseasand we if would let the EPA follow through with what they want to do. increasing the cost of energywe will lose all our manufacturing overseas. I have not checked the record. but my guess is a lot of my colleagues who are fighting the McConnell amendment and think it is not the right thing to do are the very same people who are very chagrined because jobs are going overseas and are blaming American industry. Well. if we are going to pass a law that increases the cost of energy in this country. we are not going to have a level playing field with our competitors overseas. That is why I have always said. if we want to regulate C02. we need to do it by international agreement. Because if China is not on the same level playing field as we are. then we are going to lose our manufacturing to China and other countries. It happens that China puts more CO2 in the air than we do. Take China and Brazil and India and Indonesia. and they put a lot more CO2 into the air than the United States does. Yet somehow EPA is of the view that the United States acting alone can solve the global warming problem? Well. even the EPA Director has testified before committees of Congress that if the rest of the world does not do it. we are not going to make a dent in CO2 just by the United States doing it. But the argument goes that the United States ought to show political leadership in this global economy we have. and if the United States would do something about CO2. the rest of the world would follow along. But China has already said they are not going to follow along. Even Japan. which signed on to the Kyoto treaty. said they would not be involved in extending the Kyoto treaty beyond 2012. If the United States did it by itself. under the guise of being a world leader and setting an example. and the rest of the world did not do it. Uncle Sam would soon become ""Uncle Sucker."" and we would find our manufacturing fleeing the United States to places where they do not have regulation on C02. where energy expenses are not as high. and we would lose the jobs accordingly. In a sense. then. those people who have complained for decades about American manufacturing moving overseas would destine the United States to lose more of it. I do not understand how people who are concerned about losing jobs overseas could be fighting the McConnell amendment. Because if we want to preserve jobs in America. our industry has to be competitive with the rest of the world. So I hope the McConnell amendment will be adopted. and I hope there will be some consistency in the reasoning of people who are concerned about the movement of jobs overseas. that it is intellectually dishonest to support EPA adopting regulations that are going to make America uncompetitive. There is nothing wrong with seeking a solution to the CO2 problem. There is nothing wrong with working on the issue of global warming. But it ought to be a level playing field for American industry so we can be competitive with the rest of the world and not lose our industry. not lose our manufacturing overseas. and not lose the jobs that are connected with it. But it often is the case that when either the courts or the Congress delegates broad powers to the executive branch agencies. it seems like we give them an inch and they take a mile. There are plenty of other examples as welland I will go into some of them in just a momentof EPA having some authority and moving very dramatically beyond what Congress intended in a way that does not meet the commonsense test. The work of EPA on C02 is a perfect example of this kind of overreach. First of all. they did not have to do it just because the Supreme Court said they could do it. But like regulators. they want to regulate. and they are moving ahead. I suppose they are moving ahead also because. in 2009. the House of Representatives passed a bill regulating CO2a bill that would have made the United States very uncompetitive. as I have stated the EPA willbut the Senate declined to take it up. I think this administration is intent upon getting the job done. and so they go to EPA to issue a rule because Congress will not pass the legislation it wants. It is so typical of so many things this administration is doing. that because Congress will not pass a law they want. they see what they can do by regulation. So they are setting out to accomplish a lot of change in public policy that Congress declines to endorse. but they are going to act anyway. If they claim the authority to do it. they will probably get away with it and avoid the will of the people. the will of the people expressed through the Congress of the United States. So if Congress decides to not do something. can the administration ignore the will of the people? Yes. they can. if they want to. but they should not. in my judgment. It brings me to not only the McConnell amendment but a lot of other things we should be doing around here to prevent this outrageous overreach by not only the Environmental Protection Agency but by a lot of other agencies as well. Because when the EPA and other agencies promulgate rules that go beyond the intent of Congressand never could have passed Congressit undermines our system of checks and balances. The American people can hold their member of Congress accountable for passing laws they do not like. However. when unelected bureaucrats implement policies with the force of law that they would not have been able to get through the Congressand that is without direct accountability when a regulator acts instead of Congress actingsomething is very wrong. and it is against the will of the people. I think it is time for Congress to reassert its constitutional role. We try to do this from time to time in a process called the Congressional Review Act. I recall last June the Senator from Alaska. Ms. MURKOWSKI. proposed doing that on these very rules affecting CO2. We did not get a majority vote. so it did not happen. Maybe in the new Congress such an attempt would get a majority vote. We cannot apply that Congressional Review Act again to those same rules. so that brings about the McConnell amendment I am speaking aboutto take away the authority of EPA to do it. But perhaps we can use the congressional Review Act on a lot of other issues yet that regulators are regulating maybe against the will of the people. and I hope we will.

I received a letter yesterday from an acquaintance of minea friend. I will saywho bas been a resident of Mexico tor a long time. I have known rhis gentleman for 30 years and more. and he is a man of fine intelligence and of the highest character. This letter contains some very valuable suggestions. it seems to me. and I desire to read an extract from it to the Senate: I am Just from the Interior of Mexico and am very much alarmed at this talk of Intervention on the part of our Government in the affairs of that country. The main question seems to he to dispose of Huerta. Why do we not allow the people of Mexico to dispose of him? They would have done It a long time ago If we lid kept our hands off. and they have very nearly done so anyway. in spite of the handicap of our socalled neutrality which has kept thousands of soldiers on their border. preventing those who are fighting for the liberty of their country from importing arms and ammunition. No American soldier should he sent across the border unless it is for the purpose of the VTnited States Government to add Mexico to our national domain. This might be a great idea. but it would be conquest. Then. what of the moral side of the question? Are not the people of Mexico entitled to even a trial at selfgovernment? The conctitutionallsts have practically whipped the -uorta government and are In actual control of the greater part of Mexico and are ralning strength every day. while the Huerta government Is failing. They should be allowed at least a fair chance to carry out the principles for which they have fought. It may be claimed that intervention on our part simply meant estahlihing stable government and then withdrawing. but. in my opinion. that would be Impossible. I want to impress upon you that armed Intevention means conquest. and that In this Instance It will ultimately mean the conquest of all Mexico. When our soldiers cross the Mexican border all the refugees from Mexico who are now in this country will return to their homes. and hundreds of thousands of soldiers of fortune. adventurers. Investors. home seekers. and all elaeses will rush in. as they would have a legal right to do. and in the future they will demand protection from our Government. and no manifesto from our Secretary of State will get them out again. There will be the graves of thousands of our soldiers there. and also the expenditure of hundreds of millions of our money In establishing our dominion. and with such sacrifice our people will believe that they have rights in that country that are equal to* those of the lMfexicans themselves. Under such circumstances you know that It will be impossible for us to withdraw. It is an entirely different situation from that of Cuba or the Philippines. What was the result of our war with Mexico in 1846? Conquest and additional territory. I want to predict to you that if we intervene in Mexico. which simply means going to war without reason or provocation with our poor struggling neighbor. It will simply he a war of conquest that will cost us thousands of lives and hundreds of millions of money. and will destroy a nation that has done us no wrong. Why should the crimes of one man or set of men lead us to ruin a nation of innocent people? Let the contending elements In Mexico have a fair chance to fight out their own controversies without interference from the United States or any other country. When I read this letter last iight it seemed to me so clear. so concise. so strong. and so pertinent that I thought it would be of value to the American Congress and to the administration to have It made public. I stated in a few remarks that I made to the Senate some weeks since that if we would let the Mexican people. both sides of this controversy. have an equal chance to equip themselves to settle this dispute. which can only be settled by the arbitrament of arms. they would settle it as they have a right to settle it. without Interference from us or from any other cotntry. I want to say now. while this subject is being more or less discussed. that we have not been charged with the responsibility of the government of the Mexican nation. and we have no right to interfere in the controversy that Is going on there now. except to treat both elements with due and proper consideration. and In my humble opinion that ought to be done without inviting any European nation to come in and interfere or aid us in any way to impose our will upon the will of that independent people.\n',receive letter yesterday acquaintance friend saywho resident tor long time know rhis gentleman year more man fine intelligence high character letter contain valuable suggestion seem desire read extract alarmed talk intervention part affair country main question seem dispose allow people dispose do long time lid keep hand do spite handicap socalled neutrality keep thousand soldier border prevent fight liberty country import arm_ammunition american soldier send border purpose add national domain great idea conquest moral side question people entitle trial selfgovernment conctitutionallst whip government actual control great part ralne strength day government fail allow least fair chance carry principle fight claim intervention part mean estahlihe stable government withdraw opinion impossible want impress mean mean conquest soldier cross mexican_border refugee country return home hundred_thousand soldier fortune adventurer investor home seeker elaese rush legal right future demand protection manifesto get grave thousand soldier expenditure hundred_million money establish dominion such sacrifice people believe right country equal lmfexican such circumstance know impossible withdraw different situation result war conquest additional territory want predict intervene mean go war reason provocation poor struggling neighbor war conquest cost thousand life hundred_million money destroy nation do wrong crime man set man lead ruin nation innocent people let contending element fair chance fight own controversy interference other country read letter last iight seem clear strong pertinent think value administration make public state few remark make week let mexican people side controversy equal chance equip settle dispute settle_arbitrament arm settle right settle other cotntry want say subject discuss charge responsibility government mexican nation right interfere controversy go treat element due proper consideration humble opinion do invite european nation come interfere aid way impose will will independent people.\n,63.0,bound,1,0

In the hearings before the Senate and the House committees on the unification bill and in the debates on the floor of both bodies on the same legislation the question was constantly raised as to whether or not the creation of the office of Secretary of National Defense was not placing too much power in the hands of one man and would tend to cause the military to overshadow the civilian control of the Government of the United States. The answer was constantly given that this danger did not exist because the Secretary of National Defense under the law had to be a civilian. I am not going to burden this RECORD with a vast array of evidence to demonstrate this. but it is available to the Members of Congress. to the American people. and to historians who will take the trouble to dig it out. There are a few examples. however. that should be made a part of this RECORD. In the hearings before the Committee on Military Affairs of the United States Senate on S. 84 and S. 1492. Secretary of War Patterson testified as follows on Wednesday. October 17. 1945: Again. you may hear it suggested that a single department of the Armed Forces would concentrate too much power in one man and that such power would tend to develop militarism. This is the very bogie that is always raised here any time you try to get some efficiency. Can such a suggestion be made in real seriousness? Our safety from militarism does not rest on any fabric of multiplicity of departments dealing with military affairs. It rests upon the solid conviction of our people and upon the basic democratic principle that the leaders of our Armed Forces are subordinate to the civilian department head. and. through him. to the President. to the Congress. and to the people. Mr. President. I should like to read from the report to the Honorable James Forrestal. Secretary of the Navy. on Unification of the War and Navy Departments and Post War Organization for National Security. printed at the Government Printing Office. Seventyninth Congress. first session. I read from the statement of Mr. Eberstadt. at page 15: 1. Civilian control of the Military Establishment: The founding fathers understood that militarism could be dangerous from within as well as from without. In establishing the principles of our Government they sought to guard against both dangers. In the Constitution they provided that our highest elected civilian offical. the President. should be the Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces. They placed the purse strings of the Military Establishment in the hands of Congress. A primary consideration. therefore. of any organizational plan for our military services must be its effect upon the maintenance of civilian control. At this time. Mr. President. I desire to read from the hearings in 1947 on the National Security Act of that year.

This proviso. as you will notice. would authorize the Post Office Department to carry sums in excess of $10.000 in the event that the Postmaster General. through any commercial insurance agency. would insure those amounts. I do not want by direction or circumvention to allow the Post Office Department to be held responsible for the carrying of amounts in excess of $1.000. certainly not to the extent of $10.000. for which no indemnity is required. certainly not to the extent of $10.000. and being repeated ad infinitum. which would probably run into hundreds of thousands of dollars. I think it is a most serious innovation to have the Government. under the guise of increasing the revenues. go into the insurance business. That is what this provision means. The argument is made by the gentleman from Pennsylvania and the gentleman from New York that banks today use the service for the transportation of huge sums of money. Granting that they do use this convenience. nevertheless they must go to a private surety for indemnity. However. under this bill you are permitting the Postmaster General to carry amounts up to $10.000 without securing any indemnity. I know just as sure as I am here that we are going to be confronted time after time with heavy losses if this insurance feature is adopted as a policy of the Postal Service. It is acknowledged that this service is not selfsustaining. Why should we invade the province of private industry to that extent. and which will make it less sustaining under the guise that you are going to authorize the Government to charge a fee for the indemnification?

I rise before you today in support of H.R. 4621. the ""Prevent Deceptive Census Look Alike Mailings Act."" I would like to thank Representative MALONEY for introducing this important piece of legislation. It is extremely important that we protect the integrity of the constitutionally mandated United States census and prohibit deceptive mail practices that attempt to exploit the decennial census. This legislation is vital because it will set requirements for mail bearing the term ""census"" on the envelope or outside cover or wrapper. Protecting the integrity of the Census from fraudulent activity will ensure that the U.S. Census Bureau is able to gather more accurate data. Hopefully. this legislation will ease the fears of those afraid to be scammed and therefore do not respond to the Census. It is important that the American people are aware that the questions in the Census survey are used only to produce statistics. and never identify an individual. The Census Bureau never asks for a full social security number. money or a donation. requests on behalf of a political party or requests PIN codes. passwords or similar access information for credit cards. banks or other financial accounts. The official U.S. Census is described in Article I. Section 2 of the Constitution of the United States. It calls for an actual enumeration of the people every ten years. to be used for apportionment of seats in the House of Representatives among the states. Besides providing the basis for congressional redistricting. Census data are used in many other ways. Since 1975. the Census Bureau has had responsibility to produce smallarea population data needed to redraw state legislative and congressional districts. Other important uses of Census data include the distribution of funds for government programs such as Medicaid. planning the right locations for schools. roads. and other public facilities. helping real estate agents and potential residents learn about a neighborhood and identifying trends over time that can help predict future needs. According to the PriceWaterHouse report on the 2000 Census. the Census Bureau has estimated that the Census 2000 undercounted the actual U.S. population by a net of over three million individuals. representing an undercount rate of 1.18 percent. I am particularly concerned about correcting undercounting problems because Harris County. Texas. which is situated in my district. ranked fourth of the fifty U.S. counties with the highest number of people living in hardtocount areas. In fact. 80.5 percent of the population in Harris County lives in hardtocount areas. Even more astonishing. Harris County. Texas is one of eight counties estimated to lose over $100 million each in federal funds from undercounting in the 2000 Census. according to the aforementioned Price Waterhouse report.

It is -important to note that the safe harbor does not apply to: First. statements about a company that within the past 3 years has been convicted of certain violations of the Federal securities laws. Second. statements made in .an offering by a bIank check company. These are companies that offer securities to the public. but which have no clear business plan and are therefore highly speculative. Third. statements made by an issuer of penny stock. These are companies that sell very low priced stock. often through brokers who use high pressure sales tactics. There have been significant problems of fraud in the sale of these securities in the past. Fourth. statements made in connection with a rollup transaction. These are transactions in which sponsors of limited partnerships attempt to combine many separate partnerships and rake off huge management fees. Congress passed legislation to address these abuses in 1990. We shouldnt allow these transactions to use the safe harbor. Five. statements made in connection with a going private transaction. These are transactions in which a company buys back its shares from its public shareholders. Often. it involves management of the company buying back the sharesSix. statements made in connection with the sale of mutual funds. Mutual funds simply should not be making projections. The SEC has a long series of rules governing mutual fund disclosure. Seven. statements made in connection with a tender offer also are excluded. These often are hotly contested takeover battles. and we have decided not to give them any safe harbor protection. Eight. statements made in connection with certain partnership offerings and direct participation programs. Very often. these are securities products put together inhouse at a brokerdealer. and we think the temptation for making rosy performance projections may be too great in these cases. Nine. statements made in connection with ownership reports under 13(d) also are excluded. These are the reports required under law by anyone who purchases 5 percent or more of a companys securities. The law also requires that they state theii plans with respect to the company. The committee decided these statements should not be protected under the safe harbor. Ten. finally. the safe harbor does not apply to forwardlooking statements in the financial statements of a company.

This is particularly true of our State and local administrations which are struggling to cope with a host of 20thcentury challenges on 19thcentury budgets. Significant help must be provided if they are not to be innundated by the problems of urban America. Thus. it is with great pleasure that I note former North Carolina Governor Terry Sanfords call for a major effort to improve the revenue bases of these vital units of government. Governor Sanford. who has been conducting a 2year. $280.000 study at Duke University on the problems of State administration. has urged that the Federal Government grant a substantial credit for State income taxes against Federal income tax payments. On May 10. I Introduced a billS. 1743the Tax Credit Act of 1967. which would provide a 50percent credit against Federal income tax payment for all income levies imposed by State and local governments. Governor Sanfords endorsement of this approach to governmental reform is heartening recognition by a noted State administrator of the value of a creative Federal stimulus to supplement. if not supplant. an expansion of the Federal grantinaid system. I wholeheartedly agree that further uncontrolled growth of these programs could only add to the confusion already besetting the States. As Mr. Sanford said: Federal programs are uncoordinated. leading to overlapping. duplication. triplication. conflicting goals. crosspurposes. lack of consistency and loss of direction. Mr. President. State and local governments know their own problems best. By giving them the option of raising more of their own revenue through the increased tax base made available by a partial Federal credit. they can experiment with new techniques and expand creative programs as they prove their effectiveness. I also concur with Mr. Sanfords view that the much talked about proposal for Federal revenue sharing with the States Ibid. 5 ""Behind Prison Walls."" The Century Magazine. July 1922. p. 367. Copy on Debs Ms. collection. Indiana State University Library. Terre Haute. Indiana. (Debs disapproved of Booker T. Washington because charity supported his Institute.) is anextremely interesting approach and one which might prove of great value in the future. Unfortunately. as he observes. the high costs of the Vietnam war make it impossible to enact such a largescale effort now. While the tax credit program may only be a part of a longterm effort to spur State and local government. one of its greatest assets is that we need not wait to begin. For the cost of such a system will not be prohibitive and will certainly generate far more money for State and local programs than the present conglomeration of Federal grants. The Federal Government already sustains a tax loss under the current systen. of permitting taxpayers to deduct their State and local taxes. In fact. it is estimated that every dollar of income tax currently collected by State and local governments results in about a 24cent reduction of Federal income tax liability. Thus. the initial cost of a partial Federal credit would be far less than is sometimes presumed. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that a recent article from the New York Times discussing Mr. Sanfords suggestion be printed at this point in the RECORD.\n'",cost government grow true local administration struggle cope host 20thcentury challenge budget significant help provide innundate problem urban great pleasure note former call major effort improve revenue basis vital unit government conduct study problem administration urge grant substantial credit income taxis federal income tax payment introduce bills. provide credit federal income tax payment income levy impose state local government endorsement approach governmental reform hearten recognition noted administrator value creative federal stimulus supplement_supplant expansion grantinaid system agree uncontrolled growth program add confusion beset say federal program uncoordinate lead overlap_duplication triplication conflict goal crosspurpose lack consistency loss direction state local government know own problem give option raise more own revenue increase tax base make available partial federal credit experiment new technique expand creative program prove effectiveness concur view much talk proposal revenue_sharing p. copy collection disapprove charity support interesting approach one prove great value future observe high cost war make impossible enact largescale effort tax credit program part longterm effort spur local government great asset need wait begin cost system prohibitive generate more money state local program present conglomeration federal grant sustain tax loss current systen permit taxpayer deduct state local taxis fact estimate dollar income tax collect local government result reduction federal income tax liability initial cost partial federal credit less presume ask_unanimous consent recent article discuss suggestion print point record.\n,90.0,bound,1,0

I am deeply shocked and saddened by the senseless slaughter that took place at the Palestinian refugee camps in Beirut late last week. Israel claimed that its forces occupied West Beirut in an effort to avoid bloodshed following the assassination of Presidentelect Gemayal. Yet. according to press accounts. including one report quoting an Israeli Government source as saying that Israel knew in advance about Lebanese militia plans to. enter the refugee camps. Israeli forces did nothing to prevent the militia forces from entering the camps. By all accounts Israeli forces were not directly involved in the killings and apparently even tried to expel the militia forces once it was known what the militia was doing. nevertheless Israel must bear a share of the responsibility for what happened at camps it controlled. Given the conflict and the animosity that have risen Lebanon for 7 years. Israel should have known what would happen by permitting militia forces to enter the refugee camps. More generally. what happened in Beirut is the logical consequence of an Israeli policy of arming private Lebanese militias and giving them free rein in the areas occupied by Israeli forces. Israel should now withdraw entirely from Beirut and turn over security for the city to the Lebanese army and whatever U.N. and Western forces are willing to assist the Lebanese in protecting innocent civilians. The highest priority should also be given to negotiations to remove all Israeli. Syrian. and PLO forces from Lebanon so that the Lebanese can solve their own problems.e\n',shocked_sadden senseless_slaughter take place palestinian_refugee camp last week claim force occupy effort avoid bloodshed follow assassination accord press account include report quote israeli source say know advance lebanese militia plan enter refugee_camp israeli force prevent militia force enter camp account israeli force involve killing try expel militia force know militia do bear share responsibility happen camp control give conflict animosity rise year know happen permit militia force enter refugee_camp happen logical consequence israeli policy arm private lebanese militia give free rein area occupy israeli force withdraw turn security city lebanese army western force willing assist protect innocent_civilian high priority give negotiation remove israeli syrian force solve own problems.e\n,97.0,daily,0,1

Ohios small businessman of the year. Mr. Clifford R. Alexander. president of the Crayex Corp. of Piqua. Ohio. Mr. Alexander has. in the short space of 3 years. started a plastics company from scratch. and has recently achieved total annual sales of over $3 million. His firm is a producer of polyethylene film which is used for wrapping industrial products. The criteria on which contestants for small businessman or woman of the year are judged Include: Length of time in business. employee and sales growth. financial wellbeing. original enterpreneurship. innovativeness. reponse to adversity. contribution to community projects. and personal characteristics. The competition for businessman or woman of the year was extremely stiff in the State of Ohio. which has a heavy concentration of small businesses. Mr. Alexander is to be congratulated on his award. and I wish him the very best in the national competition this week. The Small Business Administration is to be commended on the programs it has sponsored during this years national small business week. The SBA is becoming a more and more effective spokesman for the needs and viewpoints of small business throughout the country. It has been one of the most effective Government agencies in the testing. developing. and perfecting of its own programs and services. removing those which have failed. and emphasizing those which have proven effectiveness. The success which the SBA has enJoyed. and the importance of its work. have recently been recognized by the Senate in the granting of standing committee status to the Senate Select Committee on Small Business. This committee. which will now have oversight jurisdiction and legislative authority over matters concerning the Small Business Administration. will be an effective partner which will work with the SBA to continue to bring the interests of the small business community to the attention of the Congress. A very positive step has been taken by small businesses themselves in furthering their aims here in Washington. I am referring particularly to the wonderful response small businesses have given to the various small business councils and organizations around the country. I am very proud of the work done by the Council of Smaller Enterprises of northeastern Ohio. which is one of the leading groups of this type in the country. I feel it is very important that small business get organized and get down to Washington to present its special problems to the Congress. What are some of these special problems? First is the problem of the effect of Government regulation on small business. The countless Census Bureau. OSHA. FEA. IRS. and EPA forms which business is required to fill out these days are a burden on any corporation. However. per unit of output. the cost of meeting these Federal requirements is certainly highest for small business. All too often these forms. and the regulations behind these forms. have such a severe impact on the small firm that it is driven right out of business. If the Select Committee on Small Business. the Small Business Administration. and the regional small business organizations can band together to accomplish just one thingthe education of the Congress as to the differences between small business anl big businessthey will surely have justified the time and effort that has gone into their creation. Another problem facing small business is access to credit. By publicizing the horrible impact on small business of the effects of a credit crunch. brought on by either excessive inflation or Government attempts to borrow far more than it should ever reasonably have to do. these organizations can perform a great service by helping to persuade the Government to conduct its fiscal and monetary affairs in a responsible fashion. I should like again to congratulate Mr. Alexander and to express my hope that this awards program. and the activities of State and regional small business organizations throughout the country. will encourage widespread interest in the success and encouragement of small businesses everywhere. This is the sector of our economy which is the key to upward mobility for our population. and to the competition which is so badly needed to keep our economy running efficiently and in the best interests of the American consumer. It deserves all of the support and attention that we can muster.\n',great pleasure welcome today ohio small_businessman year president short space year start plastic company achieve total annual sale firm producer polyethylene_film use wrap industrial product criterion contestant small_businessman woman year judge length time business employee sale growth financial wellbeing original enterpreneurship innovativeness reponse adversity contribution community project personal characteristic competition businessman woman year stiff heavy concentration small business congratulate award wish good national competition week commend program sponsor year national small business week become effective spokesman need viewpoint small business country effective government agency testing develop perfect own program service remove fail emphasize prove effectiveness success enjoy importance work recognize granting standing committee status committee oversight jurisdiction legislative authority matter concern effective partner work continue bring interest small business community attention positive step take small business further aim refer wonderful response small business give various small business council organization country proud work do northeastern lead group type country feel important small business get organize get present special problem special problem problem effect regulation small business countless form business require fill day burden corporation unit output cost meet federal requirement high small business form regulation form severe impact small firm drive business regional small business organization band accomplish education difference small business anl big justify time effort go creation problem face small business access credit publicize horrible impact small business effect credit_crunch bring excessive inflation government attempt borrow more organization perform great service help persuade conduct fiscal monetary affair responsible fashion like congratulate express hope award program activity state regional small business organization country encourage widespread interest success encouragement small business sector economy key upward_mobility population competition need keep economy run good interest american consumer deserve support attention muster.\n,94.0,bound,1,0

But where are the American people? They are nowhere to be found. So. Mr. Chairman. let us be clear at the outset of this debate. What masquerades under the arcane title of product liability reform is nothing less than a frontal assault on consumers. on the courthouses and the juries of the 50 States. and on the continued safety of products found in our grocery stores. at our schools. and. yes. at our very homes.

The laws kept apace of striking the proper balance between citizens rights and business interests. In the past decade alone over 45 States have modified their tort laws in various ways where they needed correction. but this bill is a move to federalize all State tort law so that corporate lobbyists can get from the Federal Government what they could not get from the States. The pressure by corporations to do this in the first 100 days of this Congress has been enormous. It had to be to make the Republican majority turn its back and swim upstream from the central theme of the Contract With America which is. obviously. returning power to the States and to the people.

I have taken this time to call attention to the House and place in the RECORD for posterity to have some idea of the monumental occasion which occurred last night in the city of Chicago when 100.000 people gathered to join in a tribute to the 1.000th anniversary of Polands Christianity. under the dedicated patronage of His Excellency the Most Reverend John P. Cody. archbishop of Chicago. This inspiring occasion on the shores of Lake Michigan was arranged to remind the world that in 1966 men of good will throughout the entire world were paying tribute to the Polish people who 10 centuries ago adopted Christianity and began their glorious 10 centuries of cultural development. It was in the year 966 that the first recorded page in history about Polands Christianity comes to us. During these ensuing 10 centuries the Poles have made great contributions in the field of human dignity and freedom. Yesterday 100.000 Americans of Polish descent and Americans of all nationalities and religious beliefs and the various races joined in tribute to this millennium in Soldiers Field. Indeed one of the highlights of the occasion was when Archbishop Cody. himself a son of Irish parents. in flawless Polish told this immense audience: Long live the Polish nation. Long live the Polish faith in its church. And long live the people of Poland. The whole event was a solemn rededication of the cause of religious freedom which regrettably is undergoing great difficulty in Poland today. The empty throne of His Eminence Stephen Cardinal Wyszynski. primate of Poland. served as a reminder to the entire world that he was not permitted to join his well wishers of Chicago in this momentous observance. Cardinal Wyszynski had been denied a passport by the present regime in Poland. One could not help but say to himself and reflect. as we watched this very inspiring religious manifestation. how foolish and how unwise the present regime in Poland was in denying Cardinal Wyszynski a passport for a visit to this country. Any gains that the Communist government of Poland believes it might have made. denying Cardinal Wyszynski a passport to visit this country will be obscured by the entire rededicatlon in Cardinal Wyszynskis cause manifested yesterday in Chicago Soldiers Field. And. more important. the great belief by those 100.000 people who participated in this observance that when the final page of history is written. it is going to be the ideals of the momentous occasion being observed yesterday. the ideals of freedom and human dignity and religious freedom. and the belief in the Almighty God. which are going to triumph and the tyrarmy and the oppression of those very people who would try to obscure Cardinal Wyszynskis glorious eminence are going to be the people who are going to be obscured from history. There is no question in my mind that as we sat there yesterday on that beautiful evening. with a clear sky and a full moon. and the gentle breezes blowing from Lake Michigan. that one could understand why this great nation has endured ten centuries of hardship and efforts to destroy its will and dedication to its Christian belief and its undying and unyielding belief in the freedom of man. So. Mr. Speaker. today so that historians of the future will have a reference in a chronicle as they view in future years the contributions of Poland and the contribution of America towards a recognition of her great role in the patchwork of human events.

I rise in support of the bill H.R. 11377. and particularly to discuss section 603. which authorizes the recruitment. training. and assignment or referral of Volunteers in Service to AmericaVISTA. if you will. This assignment to me has been made because VISTA is the outgrowth of extensive hearings conducted during 1963 by the subcommittee which I chair on a bill to create anational service corps. I introduced that bill. H.R. 5625. and more than 40 of our colleagues joined as cosponsors. Some of the cosponsors were from the other side of the aisle. The printed transcript of these hearings together with submitted statements. letters. telegrams and the like. were published in two volumes. totaling almost 700 pages. These hearings have been available now for nearly a year. and the Members have had the opportunity to study them. It is significant to note the overwhelming testimony in favor of a Federal proj ect which would recruit and train volunteers to spend some time helping their fellow citizens to help themselves. We found that there was an intense spirit of service throughout the United States. We found a pressing need to stimulate still greater volunteer activity throughout the Nation. We found that the public and social service agencies believe that a nationally sponsored program for fulltime volunteer service will afford an effective means of stimulating greater volunteer activity at all levels. We found. further. that these same agencies believed such a program would encourage more young men and young women to pursue the helping professions as a career. Additionally. and of greatest significance. we found that these volunteers will make material contributions by their own efforts toward the elimination of the causes and effects of poverty. I shall not go into the provisions of section 603 in great detail. for it is well covered in the committee report. and. with unanimous consent. I shall include in the RECORD. at the conclusion of my remarks. that portion of the report dealing with VISTA. In order. however. that there is no misunderstanding. I want to emphasize several points about what VISTA will and will not do. VISTA will recruit and train volunteers. It will refer volunteers. upon requestI repeat. upon requestof State or local agencies or private nonprofit organizations to perform duties in furtherance of programs combating poverty at a State or local level. Volunteers who are referred cease to be the responsibility of the Director of the Office of Economic Opportunity. VISTA will assign volunteers. in cooperation with other Federal. State. or local agencies involved in work in meeting the needs of: The original citizens of this land. the American Indians. Those who pick the seasonal crops. the migrant farmers. Those in the slum areas of our cities. The bypassed Americans. those in isolated rural areas. The forgotten Americans. the mentally retarded and mentally ill. in nonprofit institutions assisted in their construction or their operation by Federal funds. Finally. whether assigned or referred. there is an overall category which VISTA will serve: The children in our less fortunate families who. above all. need to have their horizons lifted and to be shown their true potential in our American way of life. In contrast. there are some things VISTA will not do: It will not go into any State without the consent of the:Governor. We cannot tell Governors what to do. but. as Is pointed in the committee report. we would fervently hope that this consent would be forthcoming at all times. and especially where volunteers have been requested to work on an Indian reservation. in a Job Corps camp. or in a federally supported community action project. It will not go anywhere except by local invitation. This is statutory in the case of referred volunteers. In the case of assigned volunteers. I believe we have made and are presently making clear. by legislative history. that by the words ""in cooperation with other Federal. State. or local agencies involved."" we mean that the Director of the Office of Economic Opportunity will respond to a request for assignment in the same manner as he would to a request for referral. By incorporating a federally sponsored volunteer corps in the Economic Act. rather than making it a separate program. we have succeeded in pinpointing the use to which VISTA will be put. I freely credit my colleague. the gentleman from New Jersey . for pointing out the need to pinpoint the areas where volunteers might work. It was one of his frequent and well founded criticisms of the original National Service Corps bill. Our minority colleagues alsoas an examination of the hearings will showindicated that a federally sponsored national volunteer program should be confined to areas of direct Federal responsibility. As an integral part of the Economic Opportunity Act VISTA volunteers are now closely keyed into the overall antipoverty effort. They may participate in activities under this act. as aids. counselors. teachers. and advisers. They will assist in carrying out other Government programs on Indian reservations. in the District of Columbia. Puerto Rico. Guam. American Samoa. the Virgin Islands. or the trust territories. They may assist in programs for migratory workers. In the field of mental health. they may only work in those institutions where Federal funds have been used in part or in whole in the construction or operation of the facility. The philosophy here has been to restrict their use to those areas of Federal responsibility. We have authorized the use of volunteers in areas where the Federal connection is not so clearly defined. but we have limited the Federal responsibility to the recruitment and training of the volunteers. We have further limited Federal responsibility to make referrals. upon request. only to State and local or nonprofit agencies when the project is one to combat poverty. When a volunteer is referred. as against assigned. the local sponsoring agency is responsible for his subsistence and the payment of such stipend as is deemed desirable. In substance. we have pinpointed VISTA to poverty. either under this bill or outside it. and to areas of defined Federal responsibility. Minority members of the subcommittee know how reluctant I was to give outright veto powers to the Governors. I wanted very much to bring the State and local governments into the picture. However. in the end. I bowed to what I conceived to be the weight of numbers. No matter how much we wrestled with the semantics of legislative language. we knew that the work of volunteers. under whatever name. could not be successful without the full cooperation of State and local authorities. VISTAs authorization takes less than two pages of this bill. A great deal of work on the part of my subcommittee went into it. Fifteen days of hearings. Many conferences. Many attempts by many people to work out language and to crystallize thinking. VISTA is the essence of all that work.\n'",rise support bill discuss section authorize recruitment training assignment referral assignment make outgrowth extensive hearing conduct subcommittee chair bill create anational service corps introduce bill more colleague join cosponsor cosponsor other side_aisle print transcript hearing submit statement letter telegram like publish volume total page hearing available year member opportunity study significant note overwhelming testimony favor proj_ect recruit train volunteer spend time help fellow citizen help find intense spirit service find press need stimulate great volunteer activity nation find public social service agency believe sponsor program fulltime volunteer service afford effective mean stimulate great volunteer activity level find same agency believe program encourage more young man young woman pursue help profession career great significance find volunteer make material contribution own effort elimination cause effect poverty go provision section great detail cover committee report unanimous_consent include record conclusion remark portion report deal order misunderstanding want emphasize several point recruit train volunteer refer volunteer repeat local agency private nonprofit_organization perform duty furtherance program combat poverty state local level volunteer refer cease responsibility assign volunteer cooperation other local agency involve work meet need original citizen land pick seasonal crop migrant farmer slum area city bypass isolated rural area forget retarded ill nonprofit institution assist construction operation federal fund assign refer overall category serve child fortunate family need horizon lift show true potential american way life contrast thing go consent tell governor point committee report hope consent forthcoming time volunteer request work indian_reservation camp support community action project go local invitation statutory case refer volunteer case assign volunteer believe make make clear legislative history word cooperation other local agency involve mean respond request assignment same manner request referral incorporate sponsor volunteer corps make separate program succeed pinpoint use put credit colleague gentleman point need pinpoint area volunteer work frequent found criticism original bill minority colleague examination hearing showindicate sponsor national volunteer program confine area direct federal responsibility integral_part volunteer key overall antipoverty effort participate activity act aid counselor teacher adviser assist carry other program indian_reservation trust territory assist program migratory worker field mental_health work institution federal fund use part whole construction operation facility philosophy restrict use area federal responsibility authorize use volunteer area federal connection define limit federal responsibility recruitment training volunteer limit federal responsibility make referral request state local nonprofit agency project combat poverty volunteer refer assign local sponsor agency responsible subsistence payment such stipend deem desirable substance pinpoint poverty bill area define federal responsibility minority member subcommittee know reluctant give outright veto power want bring local government picture end bow conceive weight number wrestle semantic legislative language know work volunteer name successful full cooperation local authority vista authorization take less page bill great deal work part subcommittee go day hearing many conference many attempt many people work language crystallize thinking essence work.\n,88.0,bound,0,1

I oppose the amendment of the junior Senator from Colorado. The committees bill would take the Government out of the silver market. The Senators amendment would keep the Government in the silver market in the case of purchases by other Government agencies. I have available a table showing the sales by the Treasury Department to other Government agencies beginning with 1946. The amounts vary considerably. In 3 years there were no such sales. In many years the figures have been very small. In 1958. 1959 and 1960 it was close to 1.3 million ounces. in 1961. 3.7 million ounces and in 1962. 900.000 ounces. The Bureau of Ordnance of the Navy Department and the Bureau of Naval Weapons have taken most of the silver. I think no one would question the desirability of meeting the demands of the Bureau of Naval Weapons or the other Government agencies listed on the chart. If these other Government agencies do not make use of the Treasury stock of silver. they will have to go on the market and buy their supplies commercially. an added demand of about a million ounces a year. Unless the silver industry increases its production substantially. the added Government demand could be met only from two sources. It might be imported from abroad. which would have a direct adverse effect on our balance of payments or it might. by driving up the domestic market price of silver to a point above the monetary value. cause withdrawals by the public from the Treasury stock of silver. This would mean that the other Government agencies would in effect. be getting their supplies from the Treasury stock by this roundabout and expensive method. I recognize that there is a possibility that the Treasury stock of silver may be used up faster. if other Government agencies can have access to it for their own purposes when the market is below $1.29though. as I have indicated. if these other agencies buy on the market. it would probably send the price above $1.29 quite quickly. However. I do not think this possibility outweighs the undesirable effect of the amendmentkeeping the Government in the silver market. I favor a free silver marketas free a market as we can possibly make it. with as little governmental influence in the market as possible. Accordingly. I oppose this amendment.

This information must be computed. typed on Internal Revenue Form 1099 and mailed to the recipient of the interest or dividends. and a copy to the Internal Revenue Service. The cost of preparing these forms varies according to the accounting system that the payer uses. It can run from a few cents up to 20 or 30 cents. This information return is primarily for the benefit of the tax collecting agency. Its principal purpose is to assist in the collection of revenue. Part of the cost of furnishing this information is the postage involved. In view of the fact that the principal beneficiary of this information is the Federal Government. it is only proper that the Federal Government bear at least part of the cost. At the present time. the Internal Revenue Service receives approximately 60 million form 1099s containing information on the payment of interest or dividends. Firstclass postage on this amounts to $3 million. The law also requires that the Treasury receive copies of the form 1099. The copies to the Treasury. however. are mailed in bulk and contain several thousand per package. It is estimated that the additional postage for sending the forms to the Internal Revenue In bulk would certainly not be more than $500.000. While it is obvious that the cost of postage is a substantial amount. even if the postage were to be free. the major portion of the cost would still be born by the taxpayer. For this reason. it seems only fair and equitable that the Federal Government pay the postage on these tax information returns which accrue to the benefit of the Federal Government and indirectly to all taxpayers. Accordingly. I am introducing H.R. 10967 which would permit the free use of mails for the sole purpose of mailing these information returns to the recipients of Interest or dividends and to the Internal Revenue Service. The bill also would require the Secretary of the Treasury to pay the Postmaster General a sum equal to the cost of the mailings as determined by the Postmaster General. The reason for this is simply that the cost properly should be charged against the operation of the Treasury Department and not the Post Office Department.\n',include language require person pay interest dividend excess furnish statement amount pay payee information compute type form mail recipient interest dividend copy cost prepare form vary accord accounting system payer use run few cent cent information return benefit tax collect agency principal purpose assist collection revenue part cost furnish information postage involve view fact principal beneficiary information proper bear least part cost present time receive form 1099 contain information payment interest dividend firstclass_postage amount law require receive copy form copy mail bulk contain several package estimate additional postage send form bulk more obvious cost postage substantial amount postage free major portion cost bear taxpayer reason seem fair_equitable pay postage tax information return accrue benefit taxpayer introduce permit free use mail sole purpose mail information return recipient interest dividend bill require pay sum equal cost mailing determine reason cost charge operation,88.0,bound,0,1

The story concerns a classified report submitted to Washington by General Westmoreland at the end of 1967 in which he painted a rosy picture of successes in Vietnam in 1967 and an even rosier picture of even greater gains for U.S. efforts in that beleaguered country in 1968. Despite the fact that thousands of Vietnamese hostile to the South Vietnamese Government were able to penetrate freely into the major cities of South Vietnam with arms and ammunition to launch the socalled Tet offensive without either United States or South Vietnamese officials being aware of such actions. General Westmoreland claimed in his secret report that In 1967 the U.S. forces had been able ""to detect impending major offensives and to mount spoiling attacks."" As Mr. Sheehan stated in his article. the Tet offensive ""has since been attributed by one senior administrative official to a massive failure of intelligence."" It is obvious that if this hushhush report had not been proven utterly false by events in South Vietnam since January 30. 1968. it would have been released in February with great fanfare and would have taken its place with the host of earlier. rosy. but unrealistic reports released by high U.S. officials over the years since the United States entered upon its illfated military misadventures in Vietnam. Obviously this 1967 Westmoreland report has been classified not for security reasons but rather to keep from the American people the gross failure of U.S. intelligence gathering force in Vietnam. It is. of course. possible that the report has been classified to prevent the Vietcong and the North Vietnamese from learning how poor is U.S. intelligence of their abilities and intentions.

It is for the Government to choose whether to waive the privileges or to insist upon them. It has chosen to waive the privileges in the instance at hand. I believe its choice has been the proper one. The local decrees which the Americans in question have sought to resist are consistent with the obligations of the suzerain of Morocco. namely. France. to curtail importation of nonessentialsan obligation growing out of the requirement under the European recovery program to conserve dollars. The Americans involved have suffered disadvantage not because they are Americans but because they are merchandisers in lines of goods the importation of which is forbidden by local controls. I do not belleve this Government could properly insist that the French Government should apply controls to conserve dollars on the one hand and on the other hand insist that the controls be rendered ineffective through the exemption of American nationals.

President Aristide has a longstanding relationship with this Nation inasmuch as he left the country some years ago in the 1990s so that Haiti might regain its strength and that there might be a democratic process. President Clinton restored Aristide to power around 1994 with a number of U.S. military troops as requested by the thenpresident. President Aristide did not attempt to be a dictator. He left office in 2 years and a new president was duly elected and he maintained his position for 5 years. At that time the people of Haiti decided to reelect President Aristide. and he came back to power. During the course of that time. the worlds economy collapsed. Money due to Haiti to ensure their economic survival were denied by this administration. There were constant negotiations and engagement of the International Monetary Fund. the World Bank and others to release their funds and work with Haiti to ensure that they followed all of the necessary rules. which fell on deaf ears. Even as late as last summer. the economy of Haiti was crumbling because the world did not come to its aid. Some might say. here we go again. another nation to give sustenance to. But I say we need to look at this country. which is a mere 600 to 700 miles away from our shore. a country which stood alongside us during our Revolutionary War. and a nation which has maintained its independence for 200 years.

I commend the Senator from Illinois for her interest not only in school construction. the infrastructure for schools. but -her view about investments in children. about what it is going to take to help our society stabilize. about what it is going to take to avoid criminality and violence that we see so freely around our country. She has been a leader on those issues for children. She is always discussing what it is that we have to do to make certain that children will grow up as contributing adults with a prospect for their own successes. It is consistent with her views on what we ought to be doing for the children in our country to be concerned about the schoolhouses they attend. Senator MOSELEYBRAUN has made too many speeches. written so much about what the alternative to incarceration and prosecution is. and it is investment in our kids.

Here is a $95.000 contract to the firm of Booz. Allen & Hamilton for a study of the adequacy of existing Army and Navy ammunition facilities. Does anyone on the Appropriations Committee or anyone on the House Armed Services Committee mean to tell me that we do not have competent personnel in the Army. Navy. and Marine Corps ordnance divisions to determine the adequacy of the ammunition terminals in this country? Then the Institute for Defense Analyses. $5.465.000 to make various scientific and technical studies and evaluations for the Defense Department. What is the Institute for Defense AnalysesIDA? It was organized as a nonprofit organization in April 1956. with the California Institute of Technology. Case Institute of Technology. Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Stanford and Tulane Universities as sponsors on the original request of the Secretary of Defense. On page 182 of the hearings the statement is made that one of the reasons IDA was organized was to enable the salary of individuals to be set on the basis of their stature. seniority. and degrees. rather than on the basis of the grade into which their job descriptions would fit in the Classification Act. Mr. Chairman. this appears to be an excellent example of one agency creating an outside group to avoid our civil service rules and regulations to hire employees to perform work normally done within the Federal Government with career civil service employees. Let us look at a few of the salaries IDA is paying: 2 employees ------------- above $30.000 13 employees ------------ $25.000-$29.000 35 employees ------------ $20.000-$24.000 79 employees ------------- $14.000-$19.000 With a total employment of 241 employees. this defense contractor has 53 percent of its personnel drawing annual salaries equivalent to and even above the rate of pay of classified supergrades. Can it be that these people. with these high salaries. are that much more qualified than our career Government scientists and engineers? I doubt it. Likewise does one wonder why we are always trying to recruit scientists and engineers for the Federal Government? The Federal departments and agencies are merely subsidizing contracts and allowing such contractors to draw from the Government.

Let the RCORD show. for those who read it. that we have just heard from the former attorney general of the State of New York. a man who for many years has been active in the field of industrial relations. the distinguished Senator from New York . He is quite correct. Government seizure of the railroads at this time would guaiantee full employment for one group within our citizenry. if any of that group would like a job for many years to come. and that group is the legal profession. It would be a full employment measure for any unemployed lawyer in the country. or anyone looking for legal business. But there are other implications I would have those men think about who are among railway labor and who think all that is necessary is to seize the railroads. That may very well be a steppingstone to a concept raised by the Senator from New York in his speech. It could very well lead to demands for nationalization of the railroads. If the American taxpayer must pay a big bill. which probably would be involved in any seizure. that might start a prairie fire demand for nationalization of the railroadsto which I am also opposed. I mention this point merely to show the many serious implications of any such suggestion. I hope that members of the brotherhoods who are thinking in such terms will give serious consideration to this problem. When one looks at the present fiscal situation in regard to the railroads. we as taxpayers all own a pretty big chunk of them already. I wonder if that fact has received the weight it ought to receive. in behalf of the spokesmen for the carriers. The American taxpayer makes a substantial contribution to the railroads in various direct and indirect subsidies each year. The fiscal reportwhich I have scanned but not thoroughly studied. as a result of the hearings of the Rosenman Commissionindicates pretty clearly that at least not all railroads are in the dire financial situation we so often read about in the press. One reason they are not is that we as taxpayers make a contribution. And we should. because. as the Senator from New York knows. this is an industry vested with the public interest. It is vital to the operation of our entire economy. I am not quarreling about subsidies. direct and indirect. which the railroads receive. I make a point of fact about them this afternoon on the floor of the Senate. The carrier representatives must keep that in mind if. as. and when they are called upon. either in the closing hours of today or in the days immediately to come. to exercise the maximum of industrial statesmanship on their part by being willing to go along with any proposal for a fair procedure that will enhance the prospect of settlement of this controversy without an economic war.\n',correct implication result seizure let show read hear former attorney general man many year active field industrial relation distinguished correct government seizure railroad time guaiantee full employment group citizenry group like job many year come group legal profession full employment measure unemployed lawyer country look legal business other implication man think railway labor think necessary seize railroad steppingstone concept raise speech lead demand nationalization railroad american taxpayer pay big bill involve seizure start prairie fire demand nationalization railroadsto opposed mention point show many serious implication such suggestion hope member brotherhood think such term give serious consideration problem look present fiscal situation regard railroad taxpayer own big_chunk wonder fact receive weight receive behalf spokesman carrier american taxpayer make substantial contribution railroad various direct_indirect subsidy year fiscal reportwhich scan study result hearing least railroad dire financial situation read press reason taxpayer make contribution know industry vest public interest vital operation entire economy quarrel subsidy direct_indirect railroad receive make point fact afternoon floor carrier representative keep mind call closing hour today day come exercise maximum industrial statesmanship part willing go proposal fair procedure enhance prospect settlement controversy economic war.\n,88.0,bound,0,1

Owing to the fact that the Department of Labor. on account of the urgent deficiency bill becoming a law so late that the bureau had not time to have this printing done. had to turn back some seven or eight thousand dollars of the money that was appropriated in the urgent deficiency law. therefore it is necessary to ask for this information.

I think. however. he does not state them correctly. and that the real question here. as far as this particular motion is concerned. is whether the House of Representatives can come nearer to performing its constitutional functions if its membership Is fixed at 391 than though it were fixed at 433. There Is no doubt. Mr. Chairman. but what we can go to an extreme in either direction. We ought to be representative of the entire people of the country. and no man will deny but what we can increase the size of this body to such an extent that we lose all deliberation and make it absolutely necessary that we should surrender our individual prerogatives and rights and the rights and prerogatives of the body and of the country to some smaller governing body. Is there a man here now who does not really feel that we are already too large to perform the duties that are given to us in the House of Representatives properly and fairly to all the people? I have heard men ever since I have been a Member of this body complain of the fact that the House of Representatives had surrendered its constitutional rights and its constitutional prerogatives. The larger you make the body when you have exceeded a certain limitand I believe we have passed it nowthe more necessary and imperative is it that some body. caucus. committee. Speaker. or some one. or some select. body of men. should mark out the course that we must take. We know that right now. on account of the size of the House of Representatives. we are unable herewhere individual Members should have the right to be heard and offer amendments and discuss Important questionsto give sufficient attention. so that we can turn out of this body wellframed. wellconsidered. and welldefined legislation In which the entire country is interested. I want to say. if we could eliminate from this discussion the one fact that somebody is afraid his State will lose in representation in this body. there would be no doubt that instead of keeping the number at 391 we would cut it down to a less number. After all. that is a bogy manthis loss of representation. It will be based upon the population of the different States. and there will be in reality no loss. It is just the same in a State like mine. for instance. where If it remains at 391 we would lose one. and if we increase membership to 443 we have no change. that we should retain what we have and allow other States to be increased. as it is to allow the other States to remain as they are and decrease ours.

The penalty clause provides that any person who violates the act shall be punished by a fine not exceeding $1.000 and by imprisonment for not more than one year. I think in a statute of this character ordinarily It is a very great mistake to provide that imprisonment must be Imposed under any and all circumstances. I had something to do with the preparation of the Criminal Code. and we eliminated from almost every offense the provision for minimum punishment. so as to leave the whole matter in the discretion of the court. and we also eliminated from nearly all offenses those provisions Aihich made it incumbent on the court to impose both fine and imprisonment. The reason why that was done was that we received communications from many of the district attorneys throughout the country saying that the provisions of the law respecting minimum punishments very often resulted in juries returning verdicts of not guilty. because they knew in a given case that while the accused ought to submit to some punishment. to a fine. for example. the offense was not grave enough to justify imprisonment even for a single day. which would entail not so much hardship. perhaps. but disgrace.\n',want call attention say oblige leave charge bill consent doubt incorporate measure other suggestion desire make penalty clause provide person violate act punish fine exceed imprisonment more year think statute character great mistake provide imprisonment impose circumstance preparation eliminate offense provision minimum punishment leave whole matter discretion court eliminate offense provision make incumbent court impose fine_imprisonment reason do receive communication many district attorney country say provision law respect minimum punishment result jury return verdict_guilty know give case accuse submit punishment fine example offense grave justify imprisonment single day entail much hardship disgrace.\n,63.0,bound,1,0

I know others want to get to some of the other amendments on this bill. Let me make the case once again to our colleagues. I think it is vitally important we send a very clear. unequivocal signal at this point that we want these negotiations to result in the culmination of this tragic war in El Salvador. That is the point of all this. to try to figure out a way to bring this to a head and to an end. to send a signal to both the Government and the FMLN that. frankly. the American people are tired of this and there is not unlimited dollars they are going to pour indefinitely into El Salvadorin the neighborhood of $400 million a year. It just is not going to happen. In fact. it is rather remarkable when you consider that this year we are talking about not a cut really. we are talking about a setaside of 50 percent of military aid. We are not touching any of the economic assistance. We are just setting this aside. If people honestly believe there is somehow in perpetuity a gurarantee that El Salvador is going to get $400 million a year indefinitely. they are dreaming. That is Just not going to happen. What we need to do is to bring this to an end. We have a remarkable team of negotiators from the United Nations which is working very effectively. It have brought both sides together. There have been some difficulties with the FMLN. some with the Government. Those negotiations are ongoing since May. I point out to my colleagues we have had 9 months of the budget negotiations around here which have not exactly resulted in stellar results. We have had 4 or 5 months of negotiations between two competing armies and we have not quite reached desired results yet. but that should not be surprising. Nonetheless. it Is working. As a practical political matter. if you set as the tripwire Just the ceasefire arrangement. then one of the parties to these negotiations is going to walk away. That is certainly the case as we have seen in other such crises where we have tried to work out a compromise such as this. So. by doing what has been done in almost every other instance in the world. you realize that a ceasefire must be a part of a broader political settlement. To suggest to the guerrillas in this particular case they enter into a ceasefire without achieving any of the political results of the broader Issues is to virtually invite them to leave. That will be the result. If you want them to leave and give full funding to the military in El Salvador. then this amendment is exactly what you want to do. Of course. it contradicts the amendment that was offered a while ago. which endorses basically the framework which is included in Senator LEAHYs bill. So I say to my colleagues. if you are truly interested in seeing work this formulation that has been reflected in the earlier vote. then. with all due respect to the authors of this amend ment. ft must be rejected because it negates. it undermines. it subverts the very purpose of the structure as crafted in the committee proposal. "" So. Mr. President. I urge my colleagues--and again I say this with all due respect to the authors of the amendmentit is going to cause us significant problems and I think send us back to day one of this particular conflict. I suspect you will find more bloodshed. a far more difficult time of bringing the parties together. For those who want to see us continue to supply military assistance or economic assistance to El Salvador. I suggest that this cannot go on forever. It just cannot. It has been 10 years. over $2 billion. and it has to stop at some point. This is our best opportunity. Let us see if it cannot work. Last. let me point out. even if you are concerned about the casesfire and this thing being hooked into it. remember. if you read this amendment. the President of the United States has remarkable flexibility to respond. There is no requirements that he come back to the Congress. there be votes of certification. It says that if the President finds he is not satisfied. he has the right to release 50 percent that is on the setaside. That is tremendous flexibility. and that ought to satisfy those who are concerned that we may be crippling or hobbling the President from being able to conduct foreign policy. He has total flexibility with the language in this legislation. Last. let me insert in Rzcoan. Mr. PresidentI ask unanimous consent to do soa letter from President Cristiani. dated September 14. 1990 to me. I will quote a sentence to you. He says: Four lenghty sessions have been conducted on a monthly basis since May and the fifth round is taking place in San Jose. Costa Rica. at this present time. The basic framework of the talks calls for a twostage process: Political agreements to be reached on issues agreed upon in Caracas. Venezuela. followed by a ceasefire and reintegration of the FMLN into the civilian. institutional. and polictical life of the Country. Two stages. What the proposed amendment does is It eliminates the first stage which virtually means you will never get to the second stage. So that isyvhy this amendment is so troublesome and must be defeated If. in fact. we are going to make these negotiations meaningful. Mr. President.

To -close here. Mr. Speaker. first of all. I want to thank both the gentleman from New York and the gentleman from Oregon for their work. This is not a partisan issue. This is an issue in the best interest of this Nation. We have done things to make the traveling public who use aviation. which is so important to the economy of this Nation. safe. We have secured cockpit doors. We have air marshals on board. We have trained pilots to arm and defend their aircraft. So we have taken measures. and I think even passengers who fly would never knowingly allow an aircraft to be overtaken. So the threat is not that type of threat that we faced September 11. and we know terrorists are always looking one step ahead to do damage to us. So this is an important complement to what the administration has done. We have a $160 million research and development program to expedite producing defensive systems that can be used on commercial aircraft. and that is important. It gives us one more means of defense against a great terrorist threat. Will we be able to put these on every aircraft? No. Are we able to put an air marshal on every aircraft? No. Does this cost us money? Yes. it is going to cost us money. But stop to think of the cost of one commercial airline being blown out of the sky by a shoulderlaunched missile. Eleven percent of our gross domestic product. the entire economy of this country. is really directly related and indirectly related to our aviation industry. jobs by the millions. And since September 11. we hear 3 million jobs. I guarantee that we could find 12 to 2 million jobs that were lost just in aviation by the loss of four commercial aircraft. So we have lessons to learn. and I have brought to the floor. in closing. the Kenya missile attack in November of 2002 in Mombasa. Not one. but two shoulderlaunched missiles were launched on that date against an Israeli commercial charter aircraft. and this was also timed with a ground attack where people were killed. but hundreds would have perished had they been successful here. This is in Kenya on another continent. However. even more recently. this is a DHL commercial airliner that left Baghdad in November. 2003. and was hit. So far. we have been lucky. So far. we have been fortunate. This aircraft also survived this terrorist attack. But we know there are more of these shoulderlaunched missiles available on the open market than ever before. So the provision of the gentleman from New York helps in getting international cooperation. And again I thank the gentleman from Oregon for putting a broadbased measure together that will fill in the gaps to provide us one more layer of protection against a potential terrorist attack.

860023172,H,19590313,247,Mr. MICHEL,Unknown,MICHEL,Unknown,M,10270,10445,03131959.txt,6020,414,86110610,MICHEL,ROBERT,H,IL,M,R,18.0,voting,Mr. Chairman. this amendment which I offer today is the same one which I offered the last time this legislation was being considered in the 85th Congress. It was unanimously accepted by the committee and incorporated in the final bill approved by the House. . All I am simply attempting to do here is to write into the law specifically what the committee expressed in its House Report No. 369. 85th Congress. 1st session. page 8. which reads as follows: The committee anticipates that the diversion authorized by H.R. 2 in accordance with section 1 will be regulated with the objective of maintaining a uniform flow at Pekin of 8.000 cubic feet per second when such uniformity of flow is feasible. as determined by the Chief of Engineers and the Secretary of the Army. and when maintenance of this uniformity will not conflict with or interfere with the provisions of section 1. You see here the language is practically verbatim of that embodied in my amendment. In order that the House may again act favorably on this amendment. I should like to quickly review the reasons why this amendment should be reapproved. Inasmuch as the Illinois River runs diagonally through my congressional district for a little better than a hundred miles. we have a definite interest in any proposed increase in diversion. Except for the last few years. downstate Members of Congress from Illinois have generally been opposed to any increase. I have taken the position that an increase of 1.000 cubic feet per second would serve a number of good purposes. provided that the controlling of the daily rate of diversion is regulated to a degree by the Corps of Engineers downstream at Pekin. Ill. As a matter of fact. I have introduced legislation which differs from H.R. 1 in only one respect. and that is the text of the amendment which I offer here today. Two years ago. when I presented my views to the House Public Works Committee and last year before the Senate Public Works Committee. I sought to regulate the diversion as a means of giving those of us downstate a more uniform flow in the river throughout the year. There seems to be little question that the main cause of the death of thousands of fish in the river 2 years ago was the rapid lowering of the water level. Any quick change of the water level for any reason. aside from an outright emergency. is inexcusable. Such changes are not only destructive to fish and wildlife. but are highly inconsiderate of the people whose land lies adjacent to the river. Sudden shifts of the water level cause the destruction of those recreational pursuits which we have come to enjoy downstream. I have been told that the increased diversion would increase the oxygen content of the river and would be of major benefit to fish and wildlife. Better control of lowwater flow assists materially in the spawning activities of wildlife. It is also my belief that a better quality of water would tend to develop a better grade and type of fish. Higher lowwater stages would provide better duckhunting facilities. Reduction of diversion during the fall months in past years has tended to dry up many small pools of water that could have been used for duckhunting purposes. I point out these advantages to the sportsmen and conservationists as the objections to increased diversion in Illinois in years past have come principally from these quarters. There are other benefits to be derived downstream with a properly controlled increase in diversion. First. groundwater levels all over the State are declining. and in the Illinois River Valley. the underground water level definitely fluctuates with the river level. Any raising of the lowwater level. therefore. has a corresponding beneficial effect on the level of the underground water supply. As a matter of fact. the situation is so critical that three major industrial interests in Peoria. the Peoria Water Works. Bemis Bag Co.. and the water resources and flood control committee of the Peoria Association of Commerce. have already constructed four river water infiltration pits into which some 7 million to 8 million gallons of river water is put into our underground water supply. Plans are under way to construct a water purification plant. Other Illinois cities. including Jacksonville. Winchester. and Galesburg. have already found it necessary to do likewise in the future. Second. During the lowflow period of the Illinois River. there is a possibility of an inadequate supply of sufficient water to provide proper cooling for major industrial and powerplants. Continued industrial development will require more and bigger powerplants with a corresponding increase in demand for more cooling water during low stages in the river. Increased flow of cooler Lake Michigan water would increase the efficiency of industrial and powerplant cooling systems. Third. Higher low water levels would eliminate the costly operation of reducing river barge payloads due to low river water levels. With the rapid increase of river shipping this is becoming more and more important. A comparison of figures for tonnage carried on the Illinois Waterway indicates a growing traffic on the river. At Peoria. for instance. total tonnage for 1956 was over 18 million tons. an increase of 2 million tons over the previous year. The Corps of Engineers has just informed me that the tonnage at Peoria for 1958 was over 24 million tons. With the opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway early this summer. this figure should be increased greatly. Fourth. In past years. Icebreaking during the winter months has been a costly operation. both from the standpoint of icebreakers and tow charges. This led to an order by the U.S. Supreme Court to grant a temporary increase in diversion to cope with recent serious ice jams occurring on the Illinois River. In conclusion. it seems to me that for as many years as this matter has been kicked around. we ought to take the logical and sensible approach and approve the bill under consideration. along with my amendment.\n',amendment offer today same one offer last time legislation consider 85th accept committee incorporate final bill approve attempt write law committee express 85th_1st session page read follow committee anticipate diversion authorize accordance section regulate objective maintain uniform flow cubic_foot second such uniformity flow feasible determine maintenance uniformity conflict interfere provision section see language verbatim embody amendment order act amendment like review reason amendment reapprove inasmuch run congressional district little well mile definite interest propose increase diversion last few year downstate oppose increase take position increase cubic_foot serve number good purpose provide controlling daily rate diversion regulate degree matter fact introduce legislation differ respect text amendment offer today year present view last year seek regulate diversion means give downstate uniform flow river year seem little question main cause death thousand fish river year rapid lowering water level quick change water level reason outright emergency inexcusable such change destructive fish_wildlife inconsiderate people land lie adjacent river sudden shift water level cause destruction recreational pursuit come enjoy downstream tell increase diversion increase oxygen_content river major benefit fish_wildlife well control lowwater_flow assist spawning activity wildlife belief well quality water tend develop well grade type fish high lowwater_stage provide well duckhunte facility reduction diversion fall month past year tend dry many small pool water use duckhunte purpose point advantage sportsman_conservationist objection increase diversion year past come quarter other benefit derive downstream control increase diversion first groundwater level state decline underground water level fluctuate river level raising lowwater level corresponding beneficial effect level underground water supply matter fact situation critical major industrial interest water resource flood construct river water infiltration pit gallon river water put underground water supply plan way construct water_purification plant other city include find necessary future lowflow_period possibility inadequate supply sufficient water provide proper cooling major industrial powerplant continued industrial development require more big powerplant corresponding increase demand more cool water low stage river increase flow cool water increase efficiency industrial powerplant cool system third high low water level eliminate costly operation reduce river barge payload low river water level rapid increase river shipping become important comparison figure tonnage carry indicate grow traffic river instance total tonnage_ton increase ton previous year inform tonnage_ton opening summer figure increase past year icebreake winter month costly operation standpoint icebreaker_tow charge lead order grant temporary increase diversion cope recent serious ice_jam occur conclusion seem many year matter kick take logical sensible approach approve bill consideration amendment.\n,86.0,bound,1,0

C. C. camps as my district. My people are therefore vitally interested in the continuance of this work. We have had an opportunity to observe at first hand the splendid work accomplished by these camps. I regard this program as the most useful and constructive of any that we have adopted. The youth of this land constitute our most valuable asset. I had an opportunity to see some of the young men who were taken off the freight trains and city streets and placed in these camps. Many of these young men were undernourished. They were discouraged because it seemed as though the doors of equal opportunity had been shut to their ambition and energy. The wholesome exercise and splendid training which they have received in these camps have wrought miracles in rehabilitating these young men. I am deeply interested In the conservation of our forests and the restoration of cutover timberland to the chief purpose for which nature adapted it. We who live in timber regions are painfully aware of the result of the selfish policy of exploitation which has denuded our lands of their forests. In my own district we were blessed with timber resources that would have endured forever under a program of conservation. Our people could have found profitable employment for all times in the future had it not been for the greedy and ruthless policy of destruction which prevailed. Much of our land is primarily fitted for the growth of trees. But while I realize the value of this program I do not think it Is advisable to make this bill permanent. When this bill was first presented to us. along with other drastic measures. we were assured that the emergency program was for a temporary period. Now we are confronted with the serious question of making permanent an experiment which we have not had sufficient time to properly test. I am not prepared at present to say that this bill presents the best solution of our forestry problem. As a temporary measure to afford employment for our needy youth. I can justify my support of this measure. But as a permanent program to conserve our timber resources. and to restore our forest lands to their original purpose. I am inclined to think that we can formulate a more workable and economical plan. In my own district there are hundreds of people who know how to take care of forest lands and how to reforest. These people are in need of some source of revenue. There are many farmers in my district who would be glad to take care of thousands of acres for a reasonable consideration. They would be glad to contract with the Government to prevent fires and to guard the land during the period necessary for the growth of the trees. The farmers of my district. under such program. could conserve our vanishing timber supply and reforest millions of acres of land for a total cost that would be far less than the cost of maintaining these camps. This would give our local people employment and at the same time accomplish the purposes of conservation and reforestation. I have heretofore proposed a plan along this line. and I shall press for its serious consideration as a permanent solution. The Government has already bought hundreds of thousands of acres in my congressional district. Why not let our local citizens look after this land and reforest it? It costs the taxpayers $1.150 a year for each boy who is kept in these camps. As a temporary measure to provide employment for these young men who would otherwise be walking the streets this expenditure may be justified. but as a permanent program of reforestation I am convinced that my plan would be far more effective and economical. Under my plan the Government can say to the farmer: ""Here is a thousand acres of land which we want you to look after under a contract with the Government. We will pay you so much money a year to keep fires out of this land and to reforest it. under the supervision of the county agent."" This farmer has lived in the woods all of his life and is acquainted with this character of work. What he does not know he can learn from a forestry agent stationed in each county. He will welcome the opportunity to secure this employment. It will cost the taxpayers much less and at the same time will insure for us an ample supply of timber for the future. There would be very little overhead expense attached to this program. Under this bill it will cost the taxpayers $350.000.000 a year. Now where will we get this money? We will get It by selling taxexempt bonds which will bear interest. By the time these bonds are paid the accrued interest will exceed the principal so that the taxpayers will pay back $2 for every dollar spent. In addition to this we are creating another permanent bureau in Washington. We all know from experience that when a bureau is created on a permanent basis it is almost impossible to ever abolish it. A large part of the money will go to the bureau and will not be used to reforest our lands. I therefore urge. Mr. Chairman. that we continue this program for 2 years as a temporary measure and that during that period we work out some permanent program along the lines that I have indicated.\n'",few district many camp district people interested continuance work opportunity observe first hand splendid work accomplish camp regard program useful constructive adopt youth land constitute valuable asset opportunity see young man take freight train city street place camp many young man undernourished discourage seem door equal opportunity shut ambition energy wholesome exercise splendid training receive camp work miracle rehabilitate young man interested conservation forest restoration cutover_timberland chief purpose nature adapt live timber region aware result selfish policy exploitation denude land forest own district bless timber resource endure program conservation people find profitable employment time future greedy ruthless policy destruction prevail much land fit growth tree realize value program think advisable make bill permanent bill present other drastic measure assure emergency program temporary period confront serious question make permanent experiment sufficient time test prepared present say bill present good solution forestry problem temporary measure afford employment needy youth justify support measure permanent program conserve timber resource restore forest land original purpose inclined think formulate workable economical plan own district hundred people know take care forest land reforest people need source revenue many farmer district glad take care thousand acre reasonable consideration glad contract prevent fire guard land period necessary growth tree farmer district such program conserve vanish timber supply refor million acre land total cost less cost maintain camp give local people employment same time accomplish purpose conservation reforestation propose plan line press serious consideration permanent solution buy hundred_thousand acre congressional district let local citizen look land reforest cost taxpayer year boy keep camp temporary measure provide employment young man walk_street expenditure justify permanent program reforestation convinced plan effective economical plan say farmer acre land want look contract pay much money year keep fire land reforest supervision county agent farmer live wood life acquaint character work know learn forestry agent station county welcome opportunity secure employment cost taxpayer same time insure ample supply timber future little overhead_expense attach program bill cost taxpayer year get money get sell taxexempt_bond bear interest time bond pay accrue interest exceed principal taxpayer pay dollar spend addition create permanent bureau know experience bureau create permanent basis impossible abolish large part money go bureau use reforest land urge continue program year temporary measure period work permanent program line,75.0,bound,0,1

President Johnsons proposal. as did President Kennedys -which I also sponsored. represents a new departure and a giant step forward in the direction of a humane and sensible immigration policy. January 14. 19 65 COl Before World War I our Nation. as the land of freedom. was looked upon as a haven for the oppressed where all were welcome to develop their potential in a democratic society. And our Nation was enriched by those who came from foreigfi lands. However. after World War I. the word ""foreigner"" became an epithet as fear. anxiety. and xenophobia gripped our land. In this atmosphere. a highly restrictive immigration policy based on the 1920 census was born. The national origins quota system based on a judgment that people from one nation are better than people from another is still with us today. As President Johnson said yesterday in his immigration message. ""We have no right to disparage the ancestors of millions of our fellow Americans in this way."" The President also pointed out with respect to the national origins quota system. ""Relationships with a number of countries. and hence the success of our foreign policy. is needlessly impeded by this proposition."" The administrations immigration bill eliminates the invidious national origins quota system over a 5year period. With the passage of this measure. the results of the 1920 census will no longer shape our immigration policy. The bill also deals with the backlog of applications accumulated over the years in a number of our consulates abroad by providing for the administration of those on the waiting list during the transitional period and by weeding out those who are not serious applicants. This measure will benefit our Nation by providing for the admission on a preferential basis of those whose skills would be advantageous to the economy. The bill will also end discrimination against the newer nations in the Western Hemisphere whose citizens are now bound by minimum quotas. while citizens of other nations in the same geographic area are entitled to nonquota. admission. Mr. Speaker. I join with President Johnson in urging ""the Congress to return the United States to an immigration policy which both serves the national interest and continues our traditional ideals.

I thank -the chairman of the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs for yielding me the time. This conference report on S. 602 is of tremendous importance. It is imperative. as the two preceding speakers have indicated. that the Members of the House should understand exactly what the issues are. As I see it. the issues are quite -simple. If the Members of the House wish to follow the admonition of the President of the United Statez to curtail expenditures. stated by him only theday before yesterday in very explicit and commanding terms. then it Is not time to expand programs which will ultimately Tequire greater expenditures of Federal funds over the continued existence of this act. Although the Department of the Interior now favors an additional $100 million. that amount for expansion was not included in the Presidents budget request in January of this year. I assume that if we vote down this conference report and maintain the 17 Western States concept that this extra $100 million will not be needed or will be spent over a much longer period of time than now envisioned. The administration. might I add. did not recommend the additional $100 million. The administration did not request the bill. S. 602. and it surely did not request in any departmental report an expansion of authority beyond the 17 western reclamation States. Let me quote the Department of Agriculture. so that there will be no question about what the position of that Department is on this matter. I say to those who want to support the President of the United States. those who want to practice fiscal responsibility. and those who want to heed the Presidents admonition that this is the first and one of the major instances in which you can demonstrate that support. practice that fiscal responsibility. and heed that admonition by voting down this conference report. thus. in effect. voting against the $100 million. which means the doubling of the program presently in existence. as well as voting against any expanded authority. On May 5. 1966. the Department of Agriculture had this to say. through its Secretary. and I think it is important to point out what the Department said: This Department was not advised of this section until the bill was reported out and so had no opportunity to submit its views by report or testimony. * * * this Department recommends deletion of the House amendment which would extend the authority of the Act to all 50 States. This Department feels that the issue of whether or not the Small Reclamation Projects Act should apply to all the States or just to the western reclamation States was considered and settled at the time the original Act was passed in 1956. * * * It was objected to in debate by the Chairman of the Agricultural Committee and amended on the floor of the House to apply only to the 17 western reclamation States. This extension of the Federal Reclamation Laws to all 50 States would authorize the Secretary of the Interior to provide Federal assistance in the 31 eastern States on small water resource development projects that would be largely duplicative of that being provided by the Secretary of Agriculture under the authority of the Watershed Protection and Flood Prevention Act. (P.L. 83566). This is the Department of Agriculture speaking. and I presume they know what they are talking about. That has been discussed previously. I continue from the letter: Moreover. the Small Reclamation Projects Act does not contain the fundamentally sound requirement of Public Law 566 that needed land treatment measures to protect reservoirs and Insure proper water use in the benefited area shall be an integral part of the project. 0 * * The Bureau of Reclamation would be required to set up new offices and new personnel to serve the 31 eastern States to carry out this duplication of authority irrespective of the need for increased agricultural production. C ---1050Part 13 Small Reclamation Projects must have irrigation as their primary purpose. The Federal Government should not be promoting new irrigation development in the 31 eastern States because of the effect it would have on increased crop production.

I know that sometimes legislation seems to be delayed because the Congress is persuaded to accept something less than the best or something less than what should be provided. I also recognize the validity of the argument that. under modern conditions. elections are expensive. and that in view of the great increase in the number of radio stations and television stations. considerable amounts of money must be expended in order to conduct a campaign for election to Federal office. The raising of the limits on the amount of money a candidate may spend is a commendable objective of the bill. But. Mr. President. that. of itself. hardly would entitle the bill to be called a clean elections bill. If this measure is to be a clean elections bill. it seems to me it should be fortified by means of provisions which would contribute to public knowledge of the sources of the funds employed for the election of candidates. I suggested to the distinguished Senator from Missouri that he increase the amount which would be the dividing line between reporting and nonreporting. and I proposed that the amount be increased from $1.000 to $2.500. because I thought the latter figure probably was a little more realistic. and because its use would simplify the situation for a committee which might spend money for the campaigns of several candidates. But if a committee is going to spend as much as $2.500 in advocacy of the election or nomination of one candidate to Congressto either the Senate or the House of Representativesor if a committee is going to attempt to influence the selection of electors for President and Vice President. certainly the people have a right to know who is providing the money for those expenditures.

The extracts which I have read show clearly enough the opinion of men who have control of the state agricultural colleges. and certainly the views of trained and Scientific agriculturists ought to be entitled to some weight. The gentleman from Alabama very properly inquires why it is. if the committee believes these soil surveys to have no value. that we make any appropriation for them at all? We do believe they have value. but we believe the value depends on whether or not the surveys are followed up by utilization work. and the position we take is that with the appropriation we carry in this bill they will be able to make all the surveys which can possibly be so followed up. It is because we take this position that we make that appropriation. And to say that because S137.000 is good. $237.000 would be better. is just about as logical and worthy of about as much consideration as to say because one battle ship is good a hundred battle ships would be better. basing upon that argument a demand for an appropriation of a sufficient amount to build them. But I take the position that if the claims of the Bureau of Soils were ten times as great as they are. I should still wish to see this amendment defeated because of the methods used to force it through this House. Of course I do not refer to the gentleman from Alabama or to any other Members of the House who are supporting this amendment. They have done nothing and are doing nothing not absolutely within their rights. But it is well known that as long ago as last Friday. days before this paragraph in the bill had been reached. long before any public announcement had been made that this amendment would be offered. gentlemen on this floor began to receive telegrams from their constituents asking them to support ""the Griggs amendment."" the expectation at that time doubtless being that it would be offered by the gentleman from Georgia. Now. those of us who have served even a single session here know perfectly well that such telegrams as these are inspired. They are not spontaneous. In the very nature of things. those who sent them could not have known that such an amendment as this was to be offered unless they had been informed. directly or indirectly. by some one who was on the inside herd in Washington. Now. I know the gentleman from Alabama has not sent out this information. and I do not believe it has been done by any other Member. Then. who did send it out? Who is likely to have sent it except some one who had a personal interest in swelling the appropriations for this bureau? No one could be more reluctant than I to make a damaging charge against any man without absolute proof to sustain it. But it is so obvious that these telegrams were inspired. and it is so obvious that the men connected with the Bureau of Soils have a greater interest than anyone else has in the passage of this amendment that I can not believe I am wrong in charging that someone connected with that bureau is responsible for this outrage. For is it not an outrage? Can there be conceived a more intolerable situation than would exist if bureau officials generally. whenever they failed to get all the money they asked for from a committee. should go over the head of that committee. over the head of their department chief. and by "" building a fire"" under Members of the House. by the meanest and most disreputable of the tricks of the lobbyist. should attempt to coerce Congress into swelling their appropriations?\n'",gentleman understand view brief time yield extract read show opinion man control state agricultural college view train scientific agriculturist entitle weight gentleman inquire committee believe soil survey value make appropriation believe value believe value depend survey follow utilization work position take appropriation carry bill able make survey follow take position make appropriation say good well logical worthy much consideration say battle ship good battle ship well base argument demand appropriation sufficient amount build take position claim time great wish see amendment defeat method use force refer gentleman other member support amendment do do right known last day paragraph bill reach public announcement make amendment offer gentleman floor begin receive telegram constituent ask support amendment expectation time doubtless being offer gentleman serve single session know such telegram inspire spontaneous very nature thing send know amendment offer inform one inside herd know gentleman send information believe do other send likely send one personal interest swell appropriation bureau one reluctant make damaging charge man absolute proof sustain obvious telegram inspire obvious man connect great interest passage amendment believe wrong charge connect bureau responsible outrage outrage conceive intolerable situation exist bureau official fail get money ask committee go head committee head department chief build fire member mean disreputable_trick lobbyist attempt coerce swell appropriations?\n,60.0,bound,1,0

There is now on the Presidents desk a plan for emergency gas rationing developed for his consideration by the Department of Energy. After he weighs the plans and considers any possible inequities and deficiencies. he will submit that plan to Congress for its approval. As Senators know. only a joint resolution of disapproval by both Houses can impede the plan once it is before us. For that reason. it is essential for Congress to draw to the Presidents attention an element in the plan that gives cause for grave concern to all of us who consider the free flow of information to be an essential ingredient of a democratic society. As submitted by the Department of Energy. the emergency gas rationing plan provides for several classes of priority activity. They include public safety. law enforcement. defense activities. medical services. sanitation services. public passenger transportation. telecommunications. and energy production activities. Each of these activities. it goes without saying. is essential to the functioning of this society. But. despite the urgings of the Senate Energy Committee in its report of May 3. 1979. the Department has made no provision for a priority classification for the American newspaper industry. The simple fact is that. in an emergency such as that foreshadowed by the implementation of gas rationing. a free press. deeply involved in describing and explaining the events of the day. is more important than at any other time. But all of the typewriters in the world. and all of the neatly stacked newspapers in the warehouses. are of no use at all if they cannot reach their readers. We may be on the verge of inadvertently creating a form of ""censorship by omission."" I know that such is not the Presidents desire. and it is for that reason that I believe the implications of this omission should be called to his attention as effectively and reasonably as we can. The distinguished majority leader. as well as many other Members of the Senate. can offer evidence from their own States of the dramatic impact a failure to include newspapers as an essential activity would imply for their own constituents. Alaska. of course. is a large State. It therefore offers a stunning example of the consequences if the newspapers of my State were cut off from the fuel supply required to bring our newspapers to their readers. Let me offer but two examples of the gasolineintensive nature of newspaper production and delivery. The Anchorage Times has a circulation of 97.000 people. covering six counties in a territory of 77.000 miles. 77.000 miles. Mr. President. is a lot of territory. But it is small potatoes compared to the territory covered by the 15.000 readers of the Fairbanks MinerNews. Those readers are served by a newspaper that must be delivered over an area of 307.500 miles. Unless priority status is accorded the publishers of American newspapers. the peoole of Alaska would suffer what amounts to a news blackout at a time when information would be vital to democratic decisionmaking during a time of grave national emergency.

For. while the Wilderness Act required the three Federal land management agencies covered by the actU.S. Forest Service. National Park Service. and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Serviceto review certain qualified lands for possible inclusion in the National Wilderness Preservation System. the act also required public hearings. on the results of agency field investigations. Thus. for the first time in the history of public land law. citizen involvement was a required step in agency decisionmaking. Since 1964 a consistent pattern of citizen participation has emerged. All across the country individuals and groups have conducted their own field investigations of areas which the Agency was then in process of reviewing and have presented their findings at public hearings on the proposed wilderness area. These findings of citizen study teams often have concurred with the Agency proposal. but just as often they have not. differing mainly on boundary locations. Similarly. these boundary differencesusually based on differing opinions on how the entrance criteria contained in section 2(c) of the Wilderness Act should be applied to a wilderness proposalhave been accepted on occasion by the Agency. but often have been lacking in recommendations later transmitted by the President to the Congress. In any case. it is the function of the Congress to draw final wilderness boundaries. utilizing all available and pertinent information on each wilderness proposal. when enacting legislation incorporating a wilderness in the National Wilderness Preservation System. The Wilderness Act required the wilderness review agencies to finish their reviews and the President to make his recommendations to the Congress within 10 years. or by September 3. 1974. While the Forest Service completed its reviews of primitive areas in a planned. systematic manner. Department of the Interior agencies dawdled along creating a situation where field reviews on most areas were not completed until late 1973 and early 1974. Recommendations by the President on the last of these areas were not sent to the Congress until several months after the 10year deadline. thus creating a backlog of areas awaiting congressional consideration. As a matter of fact. when combined with other wilderness proposals remaining from previous session. a considerable backlog was created. This backlog was reduced somewhat by the 94th Congress when 32 areas were designated as wilderness. Still remaining are 39 national wildlife refuge proposals. 15 national forest primitive areas. and 40 national park units. Mr. Speaker. the bill I am introducing today combines in one bill all National Wildlife Refuge System proposals and primitive areas in the National Forest System now pending before the Congress for consideration as wilderness. These proposed wilderness areas constitute the entire backlog of these two land conservation systems which have been reviewed by the administering agency pursuant to the review requirements of the Wilderness Act. In all cases the proposed wilderness boundaries are those recommended by local citizen sponsors although. I might point. out. many of them are identical to those recommended by the agency. including certain boundary adjustments which are proposed for some areas so that adjoining Federal lands containing wilderness characteristics will be administered as wilderness. Mr. Speaker. wilderness is our countrys highest form of land dedication. Values of wilderness to the American people are multiple in nature. not just primitive recreation alone since wilderness is an ecological condition where all values and uses are administered to maintain a natural condition. Wildlife. plant communities. watershed. scenic. and similar values are maintained. ofttimes to the benefit of people far removed from an individual area. I ask my colleagues to join with me in assuring that these wilderness proposals are added to the Wilderness System as part of a continuing effort to fulfill the promise of the Wilderness Act of 1964 ""To secure for the American people of present and future generations the benefits of an enduring resource of wilderness.""\n'",enact new innovative process citizen participation formulation federal land management policy set motion require federal land management agency cover review certain qualified land possible inclusion act require public hearing result agency field investigation first time history public land law citizen involvement require step agency decisionmake consistent pattern citizen participation emerge country individual group conduct own field investigation area process review present finding public hearing propose wilderness area finding citizen study team concur proposal differ boundary location boundary base differ opinion entrance criterion contain section apply wilderness proposalhave accept occasion lack recommendation transmit case function draw final wilderness boundary utilize available pertinent information wilderness proposal enact legislation incorporate wilderness require wilderness review agency finish review make recommendation year complete review primitive area plan systematic manner agency dawdle create situation field review most area complete late early recommendation last area send several month deadline create backlog area await congressional consideration matter fact combine other wilderness proposal remain previous session considerable backlog create backlog reduce 94th area designate_wilderness remain national wildlife_refuge proposal national forest primitive area national park unit bill introduce today combine bill proposal primitive area pende consideration wilderness propose wilderness area constitute entire backlog land conservation system review administer agency pursuant review requirement case propose wilderness boundary recommend local citizen sponsor point many identical recommend agency include certain boundary adjustment propose area adjoin land contain wilderness characteristic administer wilderness wilderness country high form land dedication value wilderness american people multiple nature primitive_recreation wilderness ecological condition value use administer maintain natural condition wildlife plant community scenic similar value maintain ofttime benefit people remove individual area ask colleague join assure wilderness proposal add part continue effort fulfill_promise secure american people present future generation benefit endure resource wilderness,95.0,bound,0,1

I say unusual step. and not unprecedented. because it was something the Senate has done on many occasions in the past. Like those previous changes. the action we took was not intended to destroy the uniqueness of the Senate but instead was meant to restore the regular order of the body. I believe. as I have stated many times since coming to the Senate. that the best way to amend the rules is by having an open debate at the beginning of each new Congress and holding a majority vote to adopt the rules for that Congress. I. along with Senators HARKIN and MERKLEY. tried to do that at the beginning of this Congress and the last. Ultimately we were unsuccessful in achieving the real reforms we wanted. including a talking filibuster. But there was some hope that the debate highlighted some of the most egregious abuses of the rules and led to an agreement that both sides would strive to restore the respect and comity that is often lacking in todays Senate. Unfortunately. that agreement rapidly deteriorated and the partisan rancor and political brinksmanship quickly returned. As expected. many of my Republican colleagues called todays action by the majority a power grab and ""tyranny of the majority."" They decried the lack of respect for minority rights. I do believe that we must respect the minority in the Senate. but that respect must go both ways. When the minority uses their rights to offer germane amendments. or to extend legitimate debate. we should always respect such efforts. But that is not what we have seen. Instead. the minority often uses its rights to score political points and obstruct almost all Senate action. Instead of offering amendments to improve legislation. we see amendments that have the sole purpose of becoming talking points in next years election. Instead of allowing up or down votes on qualified nominees. we see complete obstruction to key vacancies. It is hard to argue that the majority is not respecting the traditions of the Senate when the minority is using this body purely for political gain. During the debate over rules reform we had in January. many of my colleagues argued that the only way to change the Senate Rules was with a twothirds supermajority. As we saw today. that simply is not true. Some call what occurred the ""Constitutional Option."" while others call it the ""Nuclear Option."" I think the best name for it might be the ""Majority Option."" As I studied this issue in great depth. one thing became very clear. Senator Robert Byrd may have said it best. During a debate on the floor in 1975. Senator Byrd said. ""at any time that 51 Members of the Senate are determined to change the rule . . . and if the leadership of the Senate joins them * * * that rule will be changed."" That is what happened today. We keep hearing that any use of this option to change the rules is an abuse of power by the majority. However. a 2005 Republican Policy Committee memo provides some excellent points to rebut this argument. Let me read part of the 2005 Republican memo: ""This constitutional option is well grounded in the U.S. Constitution and in Senate history. The Senate has always had. and repeatedly has exercised. the constitutional power to change the Senates procedures through a majority vote. Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd used the constitutional option in 1977. 1979. 1980. and 1987 to establish precedents changing Senate procedures during the middle of a Congress. And the Senate several times has changed its Standing Rules after the constitutional option had been threatened. beginning with the adoption of the first cloture rule in 1917. Simply put. the constitutional option itself is a longstanding feature of Senate practice. The Senate. therefore. has long accepted the legitimacy of the constitutional option. Through precedent. the option has been exercised and Senate procedures have been changed. At other times it has been merely threatened. and Senators negotiated textual rules changes through the regular order. But regardless of the outcome. the constitutional option has played an ongoing and important role."" The memo goes on address some ""Common Misunderstandings of the Constitutional Option."" One misunderstanding addressed. which we heard today is that. ""The essential character of the Senate will be destroyed if the constitutional option is exercised."" The memo rebuts this by stating that ""When Majority Leader Byrd repeatedly exercised the constitutional option to correct abuses of Senate rules and precedents. those illustrative exercises of the option did little to upset the basic character of the Senate. Indeed. many observers argue that the Senate minority is stronger today in a body that still allows for extensive debate. full consideration. and careful deliberation of all matters with which it is presented."" Changing the rules with a simple majority is not about exercising power. but is instead about restoring balance. There is a fine line between respecting minority rights and yielding to minority rule. When we cross that line. as I believe we have many times in recent years. the majority is within its rights to restore the balance. This is not tyranny by the majority. but merely holding the minority accountable if it crosses that line and makes the Senate a dysfunctional body. I would expect the same if my party was in the minority and we were abusing the rules. Many of my colleagues argue that the Senates supermajority requirements are what make it unique from the House of Representatives. as well as any other legislative body in the world. I disagree. If you talk to the veteran Senators. many of them will tell you that the need for 60 votes to pass anything or confirm nominees is a recent phenomenon. Senator HARKIN discussed this in great detail during our debate in January and I highly recommend reading his statement. I think this gets at the heart of the problem. We are a unique legislative body. but not because of our rule book. We have recently devolved into a body that our Founders never intended. Rather than one based on mutual respect that moves by consent and allows majority votes on almost all matters. we have become a supermajoritarian institution that often does not move at all. With all of the economic issues we face. our country cannot afford a broken Senate. Both sides need to take a step back and understand that what we do on the Senate floor is not about winning or keeping the majority next November. but about helping the country today. Todays vote to change the rules is a victory for all Americans who want to end obstruction and return to a government that works for them. Americans sent us here to get things done. but in recent years. the minority has filibustered again and againnot to slow action out of substantive concerns. but for political gain. Any PresidentDemocrat or Republicanshould be able to make their necessary appointments. This change finally returns the Senate to the majority rule standard that is required by the Constitution when it comes to executive branch and judicial nominees. With this change. if those nominees are qualified. they get an upordown vote in the Senate. If a majority is opposed. they can reject a nominee. But a minority should not be able to delay them indefinitely. That is how our democracy is intended to work. New Mexicansall Americansare tired of the gridlock in Washington. The recent filibuster of three DC Circuit nominees over the last 4 weeks was not the beginning of this obstruction. It was the final straw in a long history of blocking the Presidents nominees. Doing nothing was no longer an option. It was time to rein in the unprecedented abuse of the filibuster. and I am relieved the Senate took action today.\n'",today take unusual step change rule simple majority vote say unusual step unprecedented do many occasion past previous change action take intend destroy uniqueness mean restore regular order body believe state many time come good way amend rule have open debate beginning new hold majority vote adopt rule merkley try beginning last unsuccessful achieve real reform want include talk filibuster hope debate highlight egregious abuse rule lead agreement side strive restore respect comity lack agreement deteriorate partisan_rancor political brinksmanship return expect many republican colleague call today action majority power grab tyranny majority decry lack respect minority right believe respect minority respect go way minority use right offer germane amendment extend legitimate debate respect such effort see minority use right score political point obstruct action offer amendment improve legislation see amendment sole purpose become talk point next year election allow down vote qualified nominee see complete obstruction key vacancy hard argue majority respect tradition minority use body political gain debate rule reform many colleague argue only way change twothird_supermajority see today true call occur other call think good name study issue great depth thing become clear say debate floor say time member determined change rule leadership join rule change happen today keep hear use option change rule abuse power majority memo provide excellent point rebut argument let read part republican memo constitutional option ground history exercise constitutional power change procedure majority vote use constitutional option establish precedent change procedure middle several time change constitutional option threaten begin adoption first cloture rule put constitutional option longstanding feature practice accept legitimacy constitutional option precedent option exercise procedure change other time threaten senator negotiate textual rule change regular order outcome constitutional option play ongoing important role memo go address misunderstanding address hear today essential character destroy constitutional option exercise memo rebut state exercise constitutional option correct abuse rule precedent illustrative exercise option little upset basic character many observer argue minority strong today body allow extensive debate full consideration careful deliberation matter present change rule simple majority exercise power restore balance fine line respect minority right yield minority rule cross line believe many time recent year majority right restore balance tyranny majority hold minority accountable cross line make dysfunctional body expect same party minority abuse rule many colleague argue supermajority_requirement make unique other legislative body world disagree talk veteran senator many tell need vote pass confirm nominee recent phenomenon discuss great detail debate recommend read statement think get heart problem unique legislative body rule book devolve body intend base mutual respect move consent allow majority vote matter become_supermajoritarian institution move economic issue face country afford broken side need take step understand floor win keep majority help country today today vote change rule victory want end obstruction return government work send get thing do recent year minority filibuster slow action substantive concern political gain able make necessary appointment change return majority rule standard require come executive_branch judicial_nominee change nominee qualified get upordown_vote majority opposed reject nominee minority able delay democracy intend work tired_gridlock recent filibuster nominee last week beginning obstruction final straw long history block president nominee do option time rein unprecedented abuse filibuster relieve take action today.\n,113.0,daily,0,1

I rise in support of this legislation. Mr. Speaker. without question the deficit is the No. 1 issue facing our country today. We must balance the Federal budget or interest rates will soar and plunge us into another recession. Our accumulated budget deficit over the past 4 years exceeds that of all previous Presidents combined. The Balanced Budget Act. Introduced by Budget Committee Chairman JONES. is designed to bring the debate over budget deficits down to specifics. No one in this body is more dedicated to achieving the goal of a balanced budget than Chairman JONES. No one has worked harder. with more commitment and diligence. He has served this House. and the American people. well. Nothing demonstrates this fact better than the legislation we are now addressing. Today we have an opportunity to require all future Presidents to submit a balanced budget to Congress and to require the House and Senate Budget Committees to report balanced budgets to their respective Houses. beginning with the budget for fiscal year 1986. Chairman JONES proposal requires us to take the difficult first step toward balancing the budget: devising a plan whereby our goal of a balanced budget can be realized. If the President or either of the Budget Committees. determines that a balanced budget is not appropriate for a particular year. they may also present alternate budgets which are not balanced. However. these alternate budget proposals would be required to include a specific plan and timetable for achieving a balanced budget in the future. * Despite endless talk of reducing the deficit and balancing the budget over the past few years. that critical first step has never been taken. The administration which promised a balanced budget by 1983 has so far refused to even propose a balanced budget. The saddest statistic is that the savings we have realized through the painful budget cuts of 1981 do not even equal the interest we now pay on the deficit. It seems clear that after 4 years of meaningless talk this administration has no intention of giving us a balanced budget absent some affirmative plan. Meanwhile. the painful deficit continues to soar. interest rates remain high. and real fiscal recovery is out of our reach. Even if a balanced budget amendment were added to the Constitution tomorrow. as the administration requests. it might not become effective until the 1990s. This is clearly not soon enough. Chairman JONES realizes this basic fact. He knows that the budget process must be restructured if we are ever to get a handle on this problem. The Jones proposal turns a muchneeded idea into a responsible budgetary plan. We all want and certainly need a balanced budget. this proposal puts us squarely on the glidepath to reaching that goal. The time is now for all Americans to realize that the crisis of the Federal deficit demands that we stop borrowing on the future and start balancing the budget.\n',rise support legislation question deficit no issue face country today balance budget interest rate soar plunge recession accumulate budget deficit past year exceed previous president combine introduce design bring debate budget deficit specific one body dedicated achieve_goal balanced_budget one work more commitment diligence serve american people demonstrate fact legislation address today opportunity require future president submit balanced_budget require report balanced_budget respective begin budget fiscal year proposal require take difficult first step balance budget devise plan goal balanced_budget realize determine balanced_budget appropriate particular year present alternate budget balanced alternate budget proposal require include specific plan timetable achieve balanced_budget future endless talk reduce deficit balance budget past few year critical first step take administration promise balanced_budget refuse propose balanced_budget sad statistic saving realize painful budget cut equal interest pay deficit seem clear year meaningless talk administration intention give balanced_budget absent affirmative plan painful deficit continue soar interest rate remain high real fiscal recovery reach balanced_budget amendment add tomorrow administration request become effective 1990 enough realize basic fact know budget process restructure get handle problem proposal turn muchneede idea responsible budgetary plan want need balanced_budget proposal put glidepath reach goal time realize crisis deficit demand stop borrow future start balance_budget.\n,98.0,daily,0,1

H.R. 19436. the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1970. represents the Congress response in aiding this country to achieve the housing goals of providing 26 million units of housing over the next 10 years. This bill was reported out of the Committee on Banking and Currency by a vote of 24 to 4. and represents a bipartisan effort of meeting the housing needs of this Nation. We all know that the highinterest tightmoney policy of the present administration has almost brought the housing industry to a halt. This fruitless policy has cut off mortgage credit market from the middleincome families of the United States. has driven up the costs of operating Federal Government housing subsidy programs. and has made it more difficult for our local communities around the country from financing their efforts at dealing with the critical urban problems that this Nation is faced with today. We have not tried to provide all the assistance in this bill that many groups have testified that they so urgently need. We realize that our resources are limited. due mostly to highinterest rates and tight money. But. I believe that in reporting out this bill. the Committee on Banking and Currency has taken some major steps in dealing with the critical problems facing this country in providing urgently needed housing for the urban. suburban. and rural development needs. H.R. 19436 is the product of over a year and a halfs work by the Committee on Banking and Currency. It provides for two new programs: First. a new urban growth and new community development program and second. a new program of Federal crime and property insurance for urban areas when private insurance rates are beyond reasonable levels for homeowners and small businessmen. The bill would also authorize $7 billion over a 4year period for the Federal Governments housing and urban development programs. This authorization figure. although it appears very large. represents as your committees attempt to meet our housing goals. which we. the Congress. established 2 years ago. We all know that we have fallen way behind in the goals that we set for ourselves in 1968. and this bill barely attempts to keep up with our housing goals.\n',represent response aid country achieve housing goal provide unit housing next year bill report vote represent bipartisan effort meet housing need nation know highinter_tightmoney policy present administration bring housing industry halt fruitless policy cut mortgage credit market middleincome_family drive cost operate housing subsidy program make difficult local community country finance effort deal critical urban problem nation face today try provide assistance bill many group testify need realize resource limited due highinter_rate tight money believe report bill take major step deal critical problem face country provide need housing urban_suburban rural development need product year halfs work provide new program new urban growth new community development program second new program crime property insurance urban area private insurance rate reasonable level homeowner small_businessman bill authorize period housing urban development program authorization figure appear large represent committee attempt meet housing goal establish year know fall goal set bill attempt keep housing goals.\n,91.0,bound,0,1

William L. Mitchell. or General Mitchell. the Congressional Medal of Honor. I wish to take approximately 5 minutes of the Senates time to explain the reason for the Introduction of the bill. The bill Is designed to acknowledge and to reward belatedly an act of heroism and selfsacrifice in the service of his country with few parallels in history. It is a bill authorizing the President to award posthumously the Medal of Honor to the late William Lendrum Mitchell. colonel and brevet brigadier general. United States Army. Gen. ""Billy"" Mitchell was a prophet who lived ahead of his age. What he saw over the horizon was no mirage. It was a panorama of the future. a living picture of today. His prophetic vision has been justified by events. his prophesies have been fulfilled In detail. All of us have seen these things come. to pass. As a member of the Military Affairs Committee of the Senate I have become particularly aware of them. General Mitchell was a passionate advocate of military air power. He staked his reputation and his official life on his understanding of air power and his belief In the critical importance of the air arm in war and in the defense of the Nation. His conception of the striking power and the tactical uses of the air arm is being demonstrated daily in the present war. I shall not include in my brief remarks today a recitation of William Mitchells record of service to his country. The recital would be long but never dull. He was a zoldier and a man. He enlisted for the SpanishAmerican War and he came up the hard way. He commanded our air force in France during the 1918 war. He won the Distinguished Service Cross and the Distinguished Service Medal. He was decorated by the leading allied governments. He returned to peacetime service full of honors but not of years. He was still a young man with an extraordinary record of service and the promise of a brilliant future. The details of General Mitchells services. in war and in peace. and his tireless effort to make his associates and the Nation share his understanding of the great. new weapon which was being evolved. may more properly be recorded later when this matter comes before the Senate for passage. or in hearings before the committee. The Medal of Honor bears the simple legend ""Fur valor."" I invite the Members of the Senate to think of that: ""For valor."" There is the valor of heroic deeds. risking injury. disfigurement. or death. in the heat of conflict. with the moral support of comrades and the example of others. And there is the lonely valor of deliberate sacrifice for a belief. for a high purpose. without moral support. without heat. without passion. facing bitter criticism. slander. and public disgracethe lonely valor of grim determination and devotion to a high duty. a moral valor. an intellectual valor. if you will. a valor that faces. undismayed. not the quick. hot death of conflict and then blessed oblivion. but the slow. cold death of disgrace and calumny. which must be died anew every day. We in the Senate know something of thi kind of valor. We know the strength it takes. William Mitchell deliberately. and with full knowledge of the probable consequences. sacrificed his career and his reputation as a desperate recourse to bring *to the attention of his associates and his Nation the things the world is learning now by bitter experience. The fact that we failed to heed him then does not reduce our debt to him. Mr. President and my esteemed colleagues. I am not proposing that we honor ""Billy"" Mitchell by this act. ""Billy"" Mitchells record and the vindication of his prophetic vision are his honor. I am proposing that we honor ourselves by doing a measure of justice to a brave soldier and a farseeing man who dared to do his duty. and in so doing deliberately sacrificed himself for his country. That is the height of true valor.

Senator BAKER. and a number of my colleagues. I am today introducing legislation to provide for the awarding of a special gold medal to Danny Thomas in recognition of his humanitarian efforts and outstanding work as an American. In October of this year. the worldrenowned St. Jude Childrens Hospital of Memphis will hold its annual convention here in Washington. They will be honoring this great manDanny Thomas. The President has agreed to present this award to Danny on behalf of the U.S. Senate during the St. Jude Convention. Danny has exercised his great comedic talent in nightclubs. films. theatre. radio. and television. but it is the latter medium that projected him into becoming one of the most popular entertainers of his time. In the early 1930s. Danny had saved enough money from jobs as a busboy. punchpress operators assistant. and a lumberyard watchman to buy a couple of suits and several pairs of shoes so he could move from Toledo to Detroit to look for a job in show business. One of his first jobs when in Detroit was that of a singer on a radio show called ""The Happy Hour Club"" where he met his wife whom he married in 1936. With Detroit turning sour on him. Danny elected to move to Chicago where he took a job as a standup comedian at the 5100 Club in Chicagos northside in 1940. His popularity swiftly increased when the William Morris Agency began managing Danny and booked him at La Martinique in New York and Ches Paree in Chicago. There was. however. one detour up his career ladder. During World War II. Danny entertained with USO troupes in north Africa. Italy. and the Philippines. From here. Danny moved to a different mediumthat of the silver screen. In 1947. he costarred with Margaret OBrien in MGMs ""The Unfinished Dance."" and followed with ""The Big City"" and ""Call Me Mister."" In 1951 he costarred with Doris Day in Warner Bros. ""Ill See You in My Dreams"" and then starred In the ""Jazz Singer."" But as it turned out. television was Dannys medium. In 1953. he launched ""Make )oom for Daddy"" on ABCTV. The television series actually was based on 14 years of Dannys own life. This series evolved into one of the most successful and honored familycomedy shows in television history. The television series won many awards. five Emmys among them. But after 11 seasons. and with the show still among the top 10 in ratings. Danny voluntarily ended the series. Then in 1960. in partnership with Sheldon Leonard. Danny became a producer of what one newspaper columnist called a comic supermarket. Shows in this stable included the ""Andy Griffith Show."" ""Bill Danna Show."" ""Gomer Pyle."" and ""The Tycoon."" And his television career was furthered in 1966 when he formed ThomasSpelling Productions with writerproducer Aaron Spelling. The companys ventures included the ""Mod Squad."" ""The Guns of Will Sonnet"" with Walter Brennan. and ""Rango"" with Tim Conway. More recently Danny has done. a number of television specials and has made many guest star appearances on various TV shows. And in 1976. Danny starred in a new situation comedy entitled ""The Practice"" for NBC. Although Danny is recognized as one of the most accomplished entertainers of our time. his most significant achievement is St. Jude Childrens Research Hospital. This institution was erected in Memphis. Tenn.. and is the fulfillment of a vow he made when he was a desperately poor. young. struggling comedian. In 1938. when his wife Rosemarie. was about to give birth to her first child. Mario. the Thomases were leading a precarious life with Danny working mostly. to use his own description. as a $2anight saloon comic. Rosemarie begged him to get into some other line of work. Desperate. Danny sought relief in prayer. He knelt before the statue of St. Jude. the patron saint of the hopeless. and vowed to erect a shrine to St. Jude should he succeed in show business. In 1946. after achieving fame and recognition. Danny began a oneman campaign to raise funds for his shrine to St. Jude. He founded ALSAC (Aiding Leukemia Stricken American Children) to raise funds for the hospital which he decided would be the only fitting shrine to his patron saint. St. Jude Childrens Research Hospital is a nonprofit hospital dedicated to helping grievously ill children of all faiths and races. children living and yet unborn. This medical institution. founded by Danny Thomas. has achieved a remarkable 53percent cure rate. Down the years an avalanche of honors from scores of civic. religious. cultural. medical. and brotherhood groups have inundated him mostly as tokens of appreciation for his countless acts of charity of worthy causes. Pope Paul VI presented to Danny one of the highest decorations he could bestow on a laymenKnight Commander with Star in the Equestian Order of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem. The National Conference of Christians and Jews selected Danny. Man of the Year and the American Medical Association presented him with its Laymans Award. the highest honor it can bestow on a nonmedical man. and only the sixth award made since 1948. He also received the Ohio State Governors Award from Governor James A. Rhodes. Lions International riesented Danny with the HumanItarian Award and he is also therecipient of the National Exchange Clubs Outstanding American Award. The list is virtually endless. Danny Thomas. born into poverty. has become one of Americas most renowned and successful entertainers. He has matured into a man with extraordinary faith. charity. and humanitarian instincts. My purpose in lifeDanny has said. Is to propogate the philosophy of mans faith in man. based upon my own belief that unless man reestablished his faith in his fellow bcings he can never establish a faith in God. In order that others to follow may be inspired to do likewise. I have to leave something tangible. Im not so unforgettable that I can do it only with words. I must leave something that men can touch. feel. and see. That is St. Jude Childrens Research Hospital. In closing. I would like to emphasize the faCt that Danny Thomas has helped to alleviate the suffering of many children throughout the world and given them hope for a brighter future. For this reason.

1100064588,S,20070625,355,Mr. WYDEN,Unknown,WYDEN,Unknown,M,20430,21030,06252007.txt,20260,1328,110121791,WYDEN,RON,S,OR,M,D,,voting,"Mr. President and colleagues. there will be a great deal of activity in the Senate this week. and I want to take a few minutes to talk about the fact that this is going to be a big week in American health care as well. There will be considerable effort devoted to the State Childrens Health Insurance program. I see our friend Senator HATCH on the floor of the Senate. I commend Senator HATCH for his work on this program. The effort on the State Childrens Health Insurance Program. in particular. has been a bipartisan one. involving Senator BAUcus. Senator GRASSLEY. Senator ROCKEFELLER. and Senator HATCH. I commend their efforts on this legislation. Senator HATCH and I have talked about this in the context of health care reform many times. It is a moral blot on our country that so many youngsters do not have quality. affordable health care. do not have good coverage June 25. 2""007 like the children of Members of Congress. So I want it understood that I am in strong support of the bipartisan efforts on the State Childrens Health Insurance program that are ongoing in the Senate Finance Committee on which Senator.HATCH and I serve. I particularly commend Senator BAUCUS. Senator GRASSLEY. Senator ROCKEFELLER. and Senator HATCH for the leadership they have shown. Also. this week there will be several other significant activities in health care. Tomorrow. the Senate Budget Committee will open hearings on comprehensive proposals to fix American health care. They will start by looking at the bipartisan legislation I have worked on with Senator BENNETT of Utah. It is the first bipartisan proposal to overhaul American health care in almost 15 years. That and other approaches will be talked about in the Senate Budget Committee with the chair of our committee. Senator CONRAD. and Senator GREGG. having a longstanding interest on the question of health care reform. realizing you cannot get on top of big budgetary challenges in the United States if you do not address health care. Then. finally. at the end of the week. my guess is there are going to be a lot of Americans flocking to the movie theaters to look at Mr.- Michael Moores movie. I will say. for purposes of the discussion this afternoon. since I am not in the movie business. I will spend my time this afternoon talking about health care legislation that is bipartisan in the Senate. Since I have mentioned the question of SCHIP. and how important it is. and how important it is that it be addressed quickly. let me turn now to the question of the Healthy Americans Act. After 60 years of debate. going back to the days of Harry Truman. I believe the cure for Americas ailing health care system is now within reach. My view is we are seeing encouraging signspop up everywhere. For example. -the business community has done an aboutface on the issue of health care reform. For example. in 1993the last time. Congress tackled this issue. during the Clinton administrationthe business community said"" We cannot afford health care reform. Now the business community is saying: We cannot afford the status quo. Previous adversaries. particularly business and labor. are now coming together to work for reform. As the distinguished Presiding Officer knows. from our discussions when I introduced my legislation. the bipartisan Healthy Americans Act. we had Andy Stern. the president of the Service Employees International Union. standing right next to Steve Burd. the president of Safeway Company. and midsize employers and small employers. So we are seeing the business community that so often has been at odds with labor and others coming together with them saying: We cannot afford the status quo. Finally. it seems to me we have had a coming together of Democrats and Republicans on this issue. I am very pleased. under the leadership of my lead cosponsor. Senator BENNETT. many Republicans have said they will go to a place they have had questions about in the past. that is. covering everybody. You say those words. ""covering everybody."" and. of course. to some people that implies you are going to have a governmentrun plan. it is somehow going to be a socialistic kind of plan. Well. many conservatives. many Republicans have come to agree with Senator BENNETT and me that you cannot fix American health care unless you cover everybody because if you do not cover everybody. what you have is people who are uninsured shifting their bills over to those who are insured. Families USA has done an analysis indicating. in their view. that those who have insurance may pay in the vicinity of $1.000 worth of their premium to cover people who do not have insurance. So my view is. with Republicans and Democrats coming together in. an area saying. ""Lets make sure everybody is covered."" we do have positive signs for reform. Now. of course. bumping up against these positive signs is the popular wisdom. The popular wisdom. of course. is: Oh. Government cannot possibly put something together. People say: Oh. Government cannot organize a twocar parade. let alone fix something that will be a seventh of the American economy: American health care. People say there- are too many lobbyiststoo many lobbyists--many more than leg-. islators. They are going to block it. They say. of course. touching on the point I made earlier. that people who have coverage. they are going to say: Gosh. I would rather stay with the devil I know rather than that other guy. that other devil. But I will tell my colleagues. I think the public understands the system is broken. and if now the Congress comes forward with a stepbystep strategy to fix American health care. I think the public will be receptive. So let me outline. for purposes of a brief discussion. what goes into the diagnosis with respect to what is ailing American health care. I think. for the most part. people understand what is ailing our health care system. so I am going to make this diagnosis brief. First. for the. amount of money we are spending in this country annually2.3 trillionyou could go out and hire a doctor for every seven families in the United States. So lets talk about what that means for folks in Arkansas and what it means for folks in Utah. If you divide the number of people in this country300 millioninto $2.3 trillion. which is what we will be spending on health care this year. you could go out and hire a doctor for every seven families in the State of Arkansas. pay the doctor $200.000 for the year and say. Doc. that is your job. You are going to take care of seven families. Whenever I am out and about speaking to physician groups. they always come up to me and say: RON. where do I go to get my seven families? Because I like that idea of being able to be a physician again. to actually be an advocate for patients.. So we are spending enough money. Now. despite these enormous sums and the fact that we have thousands of dedicated. caring. and talented health care professionals. the bollective value we get for our health care dollar in America is shockingly small. For example. we are 31st in the world in life expectancy. having recently surged ahead of Albania but still lagging behind Jordan. On infant mortality. we are beating out Belarus. but we are still lagging behind Cuba. Part of our challenge is we dont have a lot of health care. we have mostly sick care. Medicare Part A and Part B show this better than anything else. In the State of Arkansas. under Part A of Medicareor Utah or Oregon or anywhere elseMedicare will pay thousands of dollars for senior citizens bills. It goes right from Medicare to a hospital in Arkansas and Oregon.Medicare. Part B. however. the outpatient part of Medicare in our States. pays hardly anything for prevention. hardly anything to keep people well. and keep them from landing in the hospital and racking up those huge expenses in terms of health care. We ought to change that. We ought to change it. and I am going to talk a bit about how the Healthy Americans Act does it and does it with incentives. In addition to this bias against wellness and against preventive health care. we have a system where the biggest expenditure. which is the tax breaks for employerbased coverage. goes disproportionately to the wealthiest of us and encourages inefficiency to boot. Under the Tax Code today. if you are a highflying CEO. you write off on your taxes the costs of getting a designer smile. But if you are a poor woman working at the corner furniture store. you get virtually nothing. The biggest reductions now in employerbased coveragethe biggest reductions. according to a new study by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation--comes in the area of lowincome workers. So that is a bit about the diagnosis. and I already mentioned the fact that people who have insurance pay about $1.000 from their premium for folks who are uninsured. Now I wish to talk about what we are going to do about it. What is it we are actually going to do about the big challenges with respect to health care? When I have gone home and had town meetings. we have always had kind of a back and forth early on between folks who say they want a governmentrun health care system of some sort- and folks who want a private sectororiented system. The discussion goes back and forth. and I am sure my colleagues have had similar experiences when they are home talking about health care. But finally. after a little bit of back and forth. somebody in the audience stands up and says: RON. we want health care like you people in Congress have. We want coverage like you people and your families have. Then everybody starts cheering. Everybody is cheering for that. Nobody knows exactly what it involves or what it constitutes. but they figure if Members of Congress have it. that is what they want as well. So I very often. at that point. reach into my back pocket and take out my wallet. take out my Blue Cross card and ask people if that is what they want. It is private insurance. It covers me. It covers the Wyden family. People say. yes. that is what they want. So I wrote a piece of legislation. the Healthy Americans Act. that gives folks across the countryin Oregon and Arkansas and Utah. across the countryguaranteed coverage such as Members of Congress get. delivered in a manner such as Members of Congress have. with choices and benefits such as Member of Congress have. Folks can get all the details about how this works at my Web site: Wyden.senate.gov. Now. the Lewin Groupthey are an independent. nonpartisan health care consulting group. .kind of. the gold standard for health policy analysissays you can make that pledge. the pledge that I made for coverage at. least as good as Members of .Congress get. for all Americans for the $2.3 trillion that is spbnt annually. and. according to the. Lewin Group. you would reduce health care spending by almost $1.5 trillion over the next decade. Here is a bit of how the Healthy Americans Act works. Our country has about 300 million .people. as I have mentioned. I dont alter the basic structure of care for Medicare. the military. and the small Government programs. The reforms I make to the Medicare program keep the basic structure of Medicare as is. but we do tackle the two biggest challenges facing the program. The first is we are seeing a .huge increasea huge increasein chronic ill\x95ness. These are folks with heart and stroke and diabetes. a variety of problems that are chronic in nature. In fact. the estimate isabout 5 percent of those on Medicare use up about 60 percent of the Medicare expenses. So we create efficiencies for how to better manage the chronic care that this large group of people incur. I think it will help generate savings for the long term. As we do that. we attack the underlying reason so many Americans need chronic care. that is. prevention has been given short shrift. So under our legislation. we create incentives for parents to enroll children and their family in preventive programs. They get lower premiums if they d9. With respect to Medicare specifically. for the first time we authorize the Government to lower Medicare Part B premiums. the outpatient premiums. so that if seniors lower their blood pressure. lower their cholesterol. and engage in sensible. preventive medicine. they would experience lower premiums. So we make improvements to Medicare. and Government programs clearly can be refined. But I am of the view that in the area of Medicare and the VA and some of the smaller Government health care programs. we basically ought to focus on keeping the basic structure as it is and making improvements as I have outlined in the chronic care andprevention care withifi that basic structure. So if you do that. if you set aside Medicare and the VA. you are left with about 250 million people. About 170 million of those folks get their coverage through employerbased health care. About 48 million are uninsured. They are often without any coverage at all. They may have some very modest coveragecharity careand then we have folks in the individual market and Medicaid. So let me describe what we do for folks in that area where there are 250 million people. folks who arent covered by Medicare or the VA. If a citizen does have employer coverage. the employer is required by law to cash out the worker. We do it in a way so that with the very first paychecks. the first paychecks issued under the Healthy Americans Act. the worker will win and the employer will win. Lets say.. hypothetically. in Arkansas or Oregon. you have a worker who has a salary of $50.000. and the employer is purchasing $12.000 worth of health care benefits for them as well. Under the legislation. the employer is required -by law to give the worker $62.000 in compensationsalary plus the value of their health care benefits. Then. we adjust the workers tax bracket so they dont pay any additional tax on the additional compensation. That is important because. for all practical purposes. Senator BENNETT .and I have legislated the biggest pay raise in the countrys history by putting that extra cash in the workers pockets. So when the worker sees itwe spent a lot of time talking about itthe worker says: That is pretty cool getting all this extra money. What is the catch? There has to be a catch if I am getting all this extra compensation. There is a catch. The worker. under the Healthy Americans .Act. has to buy a basic health insurance policy. including prevention.. outpatient. inpatient. and catastrophica basic policy. The first thing the worker is going to say is: How in the world do I do that? How am I going to be able to buy my own coverage? Sowe set up something called Health Help to make it easy for people. and people could do it online. to purchase their own coverage. We fixed the private marketplace to make it easier. Private insurance companies cant cherrypick. They cant take just the healthy people and send. sick folks over to Government programs more fragile than they are. There is community rating. People go into big pools so you can spread the cost of the risk. There is guaranteed issue so you cant be turned down. We also prevent people from being hammered because they have a preexisting illness. So that is the way it works for folks who now have coverage. about 170 million of them. In the case of the worker I described in Oregon and Arkansas. $50.000 in salary. $12.000 in health care. $62.000 in compensation. if they can use that to go out. say. and buy a basic health insurance policy for $11.500 rather than the $12.000 they are now getting for health care. they can be on their way to Oregon for a great fishing trip in Central Oregon. because thatis exactly what we are trying to do. is to creafe marketplace incentives for folks to try to hold their costs down. If the employer doesnt offer the coverage. employers make a contribution on the basis of their revenue per employee. We had three groups of employers we worked on with this: large employers. mediumsized employers. and small employers. and when we launched the whole effort. there were representatives from each of those three employer groups. So it is a. bipartisan bill: Senator BENNETT. a Republican. and myself. a Democrat. It is bipartisan. and it has the support of business and labor organizations. Where does the money come from to pay for the Healthy Americans Act? We can make substantial savings by redirecting the Tax Code away from the system today which disproportionately favors the most affluent and rewards. inefficiency. We steer it more to the middle class and the working poor. There are substantial administrative savings. According to the Lewin Group. this consulting group for private insurance. we have the administrative costs down to under 5 percent. That means we are going to. systematically drive out a lot of what is being spent on marketing and underwriting and various kinds of inefficiency. which is clearly unneeded. We make substantial savings in what is called the disproportionate share of funding that now goes to the hospitals when they have to. pick up the bills for those who are uninsured. It makes so much more sense. Instead of a poor person who has no coverage going to. a hospital emergency room in Arkansas or Oregon or Utah. it makes so much more sense to use the scarce dollars so that person can afford a private insurance policy. It would be targeted at outpatient care and inpatient care and prevention rather than frittering away so much of our scarce resources for hospital emergency room services. This legislation does that. The insurance companies compete not on the basis of cherrypicking but on the basis of price. benefit. and quality. Finally. we make care for the poor much more .efficient and humane. Right now. if you are poor in America. you have to go out and try to squeeze yourself into one of perhaps 30 boxes in order to be able to get care as someone who is low income. I think that is degrading and inefficient. We can do better. Under the Healthy Americans Act. we say care for those individuals is automatic. They would get covered automatically. Once they are signed up. they are in forever. I know there are many who are saying that fixing health care is not possible in this Congress. I already mentioned the good work of Senator ROCKEFELLER. Senator HATCH. Senator BAUCUS. and Senator GRASSLEY on the childrens health program. I will be with them all the way. They have done very good work. The fact that so many kids dont have decent health care is morally wrong and Congress ought to address it. I am going to do everything I can to help them. I think this Congress ought to go farther. I dont think we got an election certificate to sit around and wait for another Presidential campaign to get going. Fortunately. under the leadership of Senators CONRAD and GREGG. the Senate Budget Committee will get going tomorrow. looking at a variety of Options to fix health care. We are going to start with the Healthy Americans Act. but certainly a lot of colleagues have good ideas. and many are bipartisan. Certainly. Senators FEINGOLD and GRAHAM have good ideas. The American people dont want us to wait for 2 more years. They are not going to be tricked into comprehensive reform. The subject is too personal. They want to know what the benefits are going to be. what their costs are going to be. but they are ready. They know the current system cannot be sustained given our rapidly aging population. the huge increase in chronic illness. the disadvantages the employers face. and the tough global markets. The American people know the current system cannot be sustained. They understand it is broken and we are going to show them there is a better way. a bipartisan way. The hearing that will begin tomorrow. and the bill Senator BENNETT and I have. will be the first bipartisan proposal to overhaul American health care. in 15 years. I dont think we ought to wait 2 more years. That is not what we got an election certificate to.do. Lets pass the SCHIP legislation. One of the key sponsors is on the floor this afternoon. Let us move on to address a new direction in American health care to finally make it possible for all of our citizens to get under the tent for basic. affordable. qudality health

I rise today in strong opposition to the amendment offered by Representa-: tive DICK SWETT to strike the $66.7 million appropriation for construction of the Tokamak fusion experiment [TPX] at Princeton University in New Jersey. Unlike the previous amendment to strike the GTMHR. the TPX has the full support of the Secretary of Energy. and it is the next vital step in development of a sound and practical U.S. fusion energy program. Over the last .year. the fusion program at Princeton University Plasma Physics Laboratory has achieved a series of milestones with its existing Tokamak fusion reactor. the TFTR. The achievements include a record energy burst of9 million watts of fusion powerusing -a commercial giade fuel mixture. Construction of the TPX will produce even greater results in a more compact fusion reactor unit.: The TPX is the next step to making fusion power a viable and cost effective commercial power option. Contrary to the arguments from the opponents of the TPX. .fusion energy does not generate high level radioactive waste. The fuel supply is derived from ordinary water. and it is safe! Finally. development of reliable fusion power plants will help free our Nation from depehdence upon foreign oil. In conclusion. Mr. Chairman. the TPX is a scientificallysound research program. It is safe. It is one of the very best longterm energy options for the future of the United States and the international community.

I only submit the question for your own selfrespect. There has never been such language used in gegard to the President of the United States on this side of the Chamber as has been used here within the past thiee or four days by gentlemen on the other side. . If some of them were present I would call their attention to the language they have used about him. disreputable epithets. such as they would not dare to employ to a member on this floor in his presence. or to any gentleman in his presence. However much he may be mistaken in any policy. no man will say that he is not great intellectually. and no man will say that he is not honest. Then upon whom does the reflection fall when such contemptible epithets are applied to a man like that? Do they not react to the discredit of their authors? Now. Mr. Speaker. Mr. Stevens has been pretty well discussed here. I have asked other gentlemen before. I have asked the gentleman from Iowa tonight who is a lawyer. whether he believes that a minister of the United States has any legal authority. or any authority. to hoist the United States"" flag over a foreign soil and declare a protectorate over its government. No lawyer will risk his reputation by answering that he has. No lawyer will risk his reputation by saying that the President has any such authority. Therefore the conclusion is inevitable that the flag of the United States was hoisted in Ha-. wail over a foreign soil and a protectorate declared over a foreign government without authority and illegally. and therefore the flag of the United States was in that act disgraced. It was hoisted there as an emblem of oppression to cover an illegal and vandal act.

Leasing Ac of 1920. The purpose of this legisIltion is to correct several flaws in the act which were created by provisions included in the Federal Coal Leasing Amendments Act [FCLAA] of 1976. This bill has six provisions. The first. and most important. repeals the punitive section 3 of FCLAA. which affects many Federal leases issued prior to passage of that act. Leases issued prior to 1976 include virtually all of the existing Federal coal leases. I believe that if this section is not repealed. it will not only limit competition for Federal energy resource leasesincluding onshore oil and gas. oil shale. tar sands. and coalbut will ultimately work to the detriment of Americas future energy supply and security. Another important provision of the bill would provide much needed economic and planning flexibility to the lease development requirements issued after August 4. 1976. the date of passage of this law. The bill also repeals three minor FCLAA provisions which are: That lands within a logical mining unit be contiguous. that a mine plan be submitted within 3 years after a lease is issued. and that reserves must be mined within 40 years of approval of the mining plan. These provisions can. and. in some instances do. interfere with the complete and efficient recovery of coal reserves. Finally. this measure gives the Secretary of the Interior the authority to negotiate the sale of bypass and maintenance tracts for which the normal competitive bidding process may not always be appropriate. This is not the first time that I. and others. have sought a workable solution to this problem. Mr. President. During the first session of the 98th Congress I introduced. along with Senators BINGAMAN. DoMENIcI. HECHT. MuRKowsKI. NIcKLEs. and SIMPsoN. a similar bill S. 1634. the Mineral Lands Leasing Act amendments. Hearings were held in the Energy and Natural Resources Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources on October 18. In light of our present timeframe. Mr. President. it is critical to stress that Congress must not wait until we are ""eyeball to eyeball"" with the 1986 deadline before we address this issue. Uncertainty about the implementagion of section 3 is already affecting planning by coal lessees and their potential customers. Active sales. exchanges. and mergers of coal properties have always been. and will continue to be. essential to the development of a sound domestic energy industry and to the strength of our national energy policy. These diversified companies holding pre1976 eases must get a clear signal from the Congress by swift action on this issue. X would like to have the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee hold hearings on my bill. and others such as Senator JoinSTONS proposal. as soon as the committee schedule permits. We must resolve this uncertainty. and we must resolve it quickly. Here. Mr. President. is the problem concerning section 3. This particular section of the FCLAA generally has been interpreted as prohibiting the Secretary of the Interior from issuing future Federal leases authorized under the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 to a company which ""holds and has held"" a Federal coal lease for a period of 10 years and is not ""producing coal in commercial quantities."" This type of punitive provision is not found anywhere else in the Federal mineral leasing program or in any State mineral leasing program. It goes far beyond the standard lease termination penalty for nonproduction of a mineral lease. Since the Mineral Leasing Act governs the leasing of onshore oil and gas. oil shale. tar sands. phosphate. sodium. potassium. native asphalt. solid and semisolid bitumen and bituminous rock as well as coal. impositiori of the section 3 prohibition would seriously impair a multimineral developers ability to secure new resources. The impact on our countrys domestic energy industries. our energy security and supply and our economy would be disastrous. The legislative lineage of section 3 makes it clear that this provision was a reaction to perceived speculation in Federal coal lease holdings. In 1976. it was an attempt to bring existing Federal coal leases into production. and was intended to prevent these leases from being held indefinitely for speculative puposes. As written. however. section 3 does not force forfeiture of a nonproducing lease. Instead. it exacts a penalty only on those lease holders who want to acquire new Federal leases. Since bona fide developers who hold pre1976 coal leases are likely to be interested in obtaining other mineral leases. section 3 would severely impact those companies. On the other hand. speculators holding pre1976 leases with no intention of acquiring new Federal leases would remain unaffected by section 3. Here. a logical question such as this might be asked: ""Why cant all. or almost all. pre1976 leases be brought into compliance with the commercial production requirementsset by regulation at 1 percent of reservesby the 1985 deadline?"" According to a study prepared for the National Coal Association by the late Harry Perry. a distinguished mineral economist with a long career in government and the Resources for the Future Institute: If all pre1976 leases were producing at 1 percent of this recoverable reserves in 1986. there would be an excess capacity of 120 million tons of coal in that year. Because of this probable supplydemand situation. many pre1976 leases will not be in commercial production by the 1986 deadline. Mr. President. it makes no sense for the Federal Government to attempt to dictate results such as these when market forces so clearly argue against it. Further. a 1981 study by the Office of Technology Assessment reveals that twothirds of the lessees in the Western States hold at least one lease that is unlikely or uncertain to meet the section 3 commercial production deadline by 1986. Of the 72 publicly owned companies holding Federal coal leases. 49 are also involved in oil and gas development. and 4 are involved in Federal oil shale leases. Since the Federal tar sands leasing and the permanent oil shale leasing programs are just beginning. the extent of any conflict with these programs is unclear. but would most likely be significant. Many companies. therefore. are faced with the section 3 sanctions. And. many companies would be forced to disrupt their other mineral operations in oil. gas. coal. and synthetic fuels if this provision is not repealed. Besides significantly. and perhaps permanently altering logical mining operations and future attempts at domestic energy exploration. section 3 could possibly end up in reduced competition either for Federal coal leases. or for other MLA leases. or both. Companies now holding leases subject to section 3 may be forced to choose between continuing to hold coal leases or to obtain future Federal leases for other MLA leases. In summary. section 3 should be repealed for several reasons: First. its rigid commercial production requirements ignore the realities of supply and demand. and assume coal can be produced even in the absence of market demand. Second. the penalty provision makes it impossible to maintain a logical. ongoing domestic energy exploration program by precluding many of the multimineral companies. and coalonly producers. from participating in other MLA mineral leasing categories. Third. it has created considerable uncertainty in the energy industry by making companies reluctant to buy. exchange. or merge into Federal coal leases. Potential developers have become increasingly reluctant to consider investing in producing facilities on Federal coal leases as 1986 approaches because of the sqction 3 cloud of uncertainty. Another important provision of this bill addresses the problem of development requirements imposed on leases issued after August 4. 1976. Present law provides that these leases must be producing in commercial quantitiesdefined by Interior Department regulations as 1 percent of recoverable reserveswithin 10 years after lease issuance. or the lease is terminated. It is simply unrealistic to expect an operator within 10 years from the time a lease is acquired to do the necessary work to define the extent. quality. and mining costs of the reserve. find a customer. obtain the myriad of Federal. State. and local mining and reclamation permits. construct a multimillion dollar mine and rail spurs and begin producing. This is not even touching upon the fact that this process is often hampered by great market and nonmarket uncertainties at every step. Mr. President. no other business is faced with such unrealistic requirements. I believe the end result will be that Federal coal leases will be forced to be heavily discounted by private operators to compensate for this totally unnecessary economic uncertainty caused by the law and the concept of fair market value will be totally lost. In the end. only leases that can be literally ""banked on"" to produce in 10 years will be acquired. and the larger new production tracts so vital for a healthy and competitive industry will be neglected. Senator JOHNSTON also recognized this problem in his bill. S. 372. and I join him in supporting the concept of an advance escalating royalty that allows the operator to extend his lease for up to 10 additional years if neces.sary. This provision distinguishes the serious lessee from the idle speculator. who has no serious intention of developing a lease. A speculator would be far less likely to pay an escalating finance charge on a lease simply to hold on to it. The bill also amends section 6 of the FCLAA to delete the requirement that an operation and reclamation plan be submitted within 3 years from the date of the issuance of the lease. Not enough is known about the reserve and future operations in the first 3 years. and in view of the other planning requirements applicable to such leasessuch as the mining and reclamation permit applications under the Surface Mining. Actthis requirement is now unnecessary. Another provision of this bill relates to logical mining units. or LMUs. Section 5 of the FCLAA requires that all lands placed within an LMU be contiguous. As a general rule. contiguity in the creation or maintenance of an LMU makes sense. There are conditions. however. where the actual physical separation of leases caused by artificial surface impediments such as roads or easements. or geological conditions. may not necessarily interfere with the ""logic"" of including a physically separated lease from a nearby LMU. This amendment simply promotes the overall intent of the logical mining provision by removing this artificial constraint. The last FCLAA provisions that the bill deals with is the deletion of the present requirement that the reserve be mined out within 40 years of lease issuance. The FCLAA requires that a lease be produced not only in commercial quantities. but that the lease remain in ""continuous operation"" over its economic lifedefined by regulation as an amount equal to a 3year rolling average of previous productionor the lease will be canceled S 2502 CO except under highly special circumstances spelled out by law. The 40year mineout provision is therefore not only unnecessary. but could also impose economically unsound and wasteful mining practices on the Federal reserve. Finally. the bill provides authority for the Secretary to negotiate the sale of bypass and maintenance tracts. which allows the Secretary the same flexibility to conduct business in the same proprietary manner as a private lessor. The recent Commission on Fair Market Value Policy recommended such authority. Since 1920. the Federal coal leasing program has provided the basis for the orderly development of a large part of this Nations coal reserves. From 1971 until 1981 the program suffered under a moratorium in which all leasing was virtually halted. During this time the western coal industry grew from its infancy into one of the major sources of domestic energy productionfrom a production base of less than 35 million tons per year to over a quarter billion tons per year. or nearly twofifths of domestic production. And. I cannot think of a State that would be impacted more than my State of Wyoming. now ranked the third in the Nation in total coal productionbehind Kentucky and West Virginiaand which now leads our Nation in production from surface coal mines. In 1983. Wyoming produced 112.2 million short tons of coal. about 14 percent of the Nations total. and nearly onefourth of our surfacemined coal. In conclusion. the 1976 FCLAA dramatically changed the rules under which the Federal Governments coal resources would be leased. and the basic thrust of those changes has been beneficial to the public. However. nearly a decade after Its passage. it is clear that those provisions which are overly punitive and threaten both of this Nations economic and energy security. not to mention the future of our domestic energy industry. should be either repealed in their entirety or modified. The congressionally established Commission on Fair Market Value Policy submitted its report on how the Federal coal leasing program can be improved. and the Department of the Interior is working on implementing the majority of those recommendations. It is now time for Congress to move ahead with the legislative changes and modifications contained in this bill which are necessary to complete the job. I look forward to working with Senator JOHNSTON and all others who. are interested in seeing this issue resolved during this session of Congress. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the RECORD.\n'",tcdoy introducirg bill c ncnd purpose legisiltion correct several flaw act create provision include bill provision first important

I oppose H.R. 14566. a bill that I consider entirely unnecessary. The legislation establishes. like the beef research and development bill previously. a program whereby participating producers can contribute to a program to promote sales of their product and spur research and development efforts. Just as some Members found the beef research bill questionable. I find H.R. 14566 questionable. Why does the House of Representatives have to spend valuable time enacting legislation that accomplishes what the growers themselves can do if they want? If peach growers are concerned about sales and research. they have every right to set up trade organizations and programs that accomplish exactly these purposes. I do not understand why the time and effort of the U.S. Congress must be used to accomplish these private affairs. We are assuaged in our doubts by the committee report. It explains that no public money will be spent. that is. public money that is spent to finance the grower referendum of this issue will be reimbursed by the growers association. The committee also. in response to the public criticism of the beef research bill. I am sure. has assured us of the impor-. tance of the consumer in this program: ""ultimately. it is the American consumer who will help to determine the success or failure of this program."" But the report goes on to say that the 15 percent consumer representatives will not have a vote. How such representatives can ""assure meaningful and active input of consumer concerns."" I am not sure. Mr. Speaker. I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill. If peach growers want to improve their product. they mutt do it themselves. The U.S. Congress cannot afford to introduce. consider. and enact legislation in order to make every particular industry in our country ""competitive."" This Government incursion into private business affairs is exactly the kind of thing the Congress is being urged to avoid. Whatever happened to real free enterprise?

The possibility that our enemies might attack us with biological. chemical or radiological weapons still remains. unfortunately. a significant threat. During the last Congress. the Committee on Energy and Commerce worked together in a bipartisan fashion to produce the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Response Act which became law in June of 2002. I was proud to have been a small part of this important effort. However. while our legislation has helped get critical resources out to the States and moved us closer to the reality of a more comprehensive strategic national stockpile. more still needs to be done. I am pleased to have worked with my colleagues and the Bush administration to develop legislation that would help make the vision of Project Bioshield a reality. As we have heard. this initiative is designed to speed the development and availability of medical countermeasures that will help us respond to any future terrorist attacks. The bill will also provide the Federal Government with tools to help encourage our researchdriven pharmaceutical. biotechnology and medical technology to develop new countermeasures where none exists today. It remains our responsibility to do what we can to ensure that the United States is ready for whatever biological. chemical or radiological threat we might face. It is for that reason that I join the others in urgifig my colleagues to join us in supporting the Project BioShield Act of 2003.\n',appreciate gentleman good friend chairman recognize speak support learn real threat terrorism importance prepare attack possibility enemy attack biological_chemical radiological weapon remain significant threat last work bipartisan_fashion produce become law proud small part important effort legislation help get critical resource move reality comprehensive strategic national stockpile more need do pleased work colleague administration develop legislation help make vision reality hear initiative design speed development availability medical countermeasure help respond future terrorist_attack bill provide tool help encourage researchdriven_pharmaceutical biotechnology medical technology develop new countermeasure none exist today remain responsibility ensure ready biological_chemical radiological threat face reason join other urgifig colleague join support,108.0,daily,1,0

I know his great interest in the apprenticeship training program and. may I say. I also share his interest because we have. in my own State of Wisconsin. one of the finest systems of apprenticeship training that exists in this Nation and I am fully aware of the great contribution that it has made to industry. I am conscious of what is being done under the law that the gentleman from Connecticut himself sponsored when he was previously in Congress. May I say that the committee was impressed with the fact that the various training programsand if you are not familiar with them I suggest that every Member of Congress ought to get from the Office of Education this pamphlet which is Job Training for Victory and study itare like a Chinese puzzle to one who is not thoroughly familiar with it when you see this great list of training programs under various offices of government that are now being carried on to train the youth of this country. I believe that is because of the fact there are so many of these programs that many people have become somewhat confused and disturbed in their thinking on the subject of N. Y. A. I want to discuss that particular phase of this appropriation bill for just a few moments. because Members of Congress have asked me as to my attitude with respect to it and why I have taken a position such as I have with respect to the activities of the National Youth Administration. Permit me to say that I am not an expert on all things and I take it that no other Member of the Congress thinks he is. After all. the composite judgment of the people in authority in this Government and throughout the Nation ought to be some directive to Members of Congress as to the course that we ought to pursue and the attitude that we ought to maintain with respect to some of these subject matters. So I approach the discussion of the subject of N. Y. A. not from the standpoint of poison or prejudice or hate. but I try to approach it from the stanrpoint as to whether or not this organization is making a contribution to the war effort and to the welfare of the peop!e of this country. If it is not making a real contribution to the war effort. if it is not making a contribution to the welfare of the people of the country. then I should be the first to disown it and to cut it out of this bill. if possible. You cannot judge N. Y. A. only by pointing to the mistakes that it has made. That is a very narrow and shallow philosophy. If you are to obtain a proper perspective of N. Y. A.. you must balance the good that it has done or is doing as against the mistakes which I concede and admit it has made. May I say at the outset that I think most of the fields in which N. Y. A. has made most of its- mistakes have been completely eliminated in this Budget estimate and under the appropriation which is now before us. As I understand the N. Y. A. appropriations as made in the past. they provided for a system of student aids to students in the high school level and a system of aids to students in the college level. Those were aids given to needy students for work performed on projects provided by the local schools and colleges to aid students to stay in school and to receive an education which might otherwise be denied them. So far as I am concerned. I am in complete accord with the Governments activity that will afford an education to the underprivileged of this country who might otherwise be denied the right to an education. and I start right there. In this Budget all student aids were eliminated. as it was submitted by the President. I think that the Presidents budget eliminated the finest and the best part of the N. Y. A.. which was the studentaid program. I do not want to classify as a group of parasites the colleges of this country. as some people do. because they have come before our committee and demonstrated to us the hardship that would fall not only upon the students but upon the colleges themselves if this studentaid program were done away with. What is the situation? Here is your War Manpower Commission headed by Mr. McNutt. Here is the War Production Board headed by Mr. Donald Nelson. They are the people who are planning and carrying on this part of our war effort. Am I going to cast aside their word. their advice. their requests and take the advice of someone who perhaps knows nothing whatever about this work or who may be prejudiced in his or her opinion? They came before this committee and stated. ""We need trained men and trained women as never before in the history of this country. We need doctors. we need veterinarians. we need chemists. we need scientists. we need men trained in the sciences badly in industry throughout this country. and there is a great bottleneck and shortage in the educational facilities of this country."" They went to the colleges of this country and said to the colleges that had the facilities to administer and give those courses. ""We want you to cooperate in this war effort by expanding your usual college course and accelerating it from a 9 months course to a full 12 months course."" And the colleges. in agreement with the request of the War Production Board and the War Manpower Commission. acceded to that request and rearranged their schedules and their courses to provide for three semesters work a year. providing yearround. 12 months work. keeping those school plants busy trying to turn out the technicians which the War Production Board and industry state are vitally necessary. In connection with that the War Manpower Commission and the Selective Service Group propose to defer students in colleges who are taking courses and who maintain decent college grades in these various activities. I ask you as fairminded Members of Congress. supposing the War Manpower Commission and the Selective Service Group do in fact defer students in colleges who are taking the courses specified. and the students are compelled to spend 12 months a year in school. what will happen to the son of the poor fellow who has been able during his summer vacation to go out and earn his tuition. his matriculation fees. and the money to pay for his school books? Sure. he may be able to work for his board and room. as I did. to get through college. He may be able to work waiting on tables and tending furnaces. as I did. but where is he going to get the money to pay his tuition. pay his matriculation fees. and pay for his books if he is compelledto stay in school for 12 months?\n'",glad hear exposition know great interest apprenticeship_training program say share interest own fine system apprenticeship_training exist nation aware great contribution make industry conscious do law gentleman sponsor say committee impressed fact various training programsand familiar suggest get pamphlet victory study chinese puzzle familiar see great list training program various office government carry train youth country believe fact many program many people become confused disturb thinking subject a. want discuss particular phase appropriation bill few moment ask attitude respect take position such respect activity permit say expert thing take other think composite judgment people authority nation directive member course pursue attitude maintain respect subject matter approach discussion subject a. standpoint poison prejudice hate try approach stanrpoint organization make contribution war effort welfare peop!e country make real contribution war effort make contribution welfare people country first disown cut bill possible judge a. point mistake make narrow shallow philosophy obtain proper perspective balance good do do mistake concede admit make say outset think most field a. make most its- mistake eliminate estimate appropriation understand a. appropriation make past provide system student aid student high school level system aid student college level aid give needy student work perform project provide local school college aid student stay school receive education deny concern complete accord government activity afford education underprivileged country deny right education start student aid eliminate submit think budget eliminate fine good part studentaid_program want classify group parasite college country people come committee demonstrate hardship fall student college studentaid_program do situation head head people plan carry part war effort go cast word advice request take advice know work prejudice opinion come committee state need train man train woman history country need doctor need veterinarian need chemist need scientist need man train science industry country great bottleneck shortage educational facility country go college country say college facility administer give course want cooperate war effort expand usual college course accelerate month full month course college agreement request accede request rearrange schedule course provide semester work year provide month work keep school plant busy try turn technician industry state necessary connection propose defer student college take course maintain decent college grade various activity ask fairminde member suppose fact defer student college take course specify student compel spend month year school happen son poor fellow able summer_vacation go earn tuition_matriculation fee money pay school book able work board room get college able work wait table tend furnace go get money pay tuition pay matriculation_fee pay book stay school months?\n,77.0,bound,1,0

I rise today to speak in support of the Indiana Dunes bill and to express my appreciation to my colleague. Congressman FITHIAN. who introduced this bill. His understanding of the needs of his constituents and his willingness to take on the industrial giants in and out of his district are to be commended. I admire his courage. I have long been a supporter of the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore Park. Even though I am not from Indiana. the dunes are a familiar sight to me. as they are to my constituents and to thousands of other midwesterners who visit and enjoy the dunes each year. The dunes are not just an Indiana treasure. they are a national treasure to be protected and developed for the enjoyment of all the Nations citizens. When Congress created the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore Park in 1966. not all of the dunes area was protected. Industry has continued to bulldoze land not included in the 1966 legislation. and conservationists have continued to fight for every piece of remaining dunes property. Action must be taken now to permit industry and ecology to live side by side. The battle between the conservationists and the industrialists for the precious land along the southern shore of Lake Michigan must come to a just conclusion. We can provide for industrys need for expansion and for the publics need for a place to escape from the congestion and pollution of urban America. This bill is supported by the Save the Dunes Council. Audubon Society. Sierra Club. Wilderness Society. Izaak Walton League. Midwest Steel Co.. Bethlehem Steel Co.. and the Northern Indiana Power Co. H.R. 11455 is a good bill. and I support it. But as good as it is. I hope the Senate will see fit to expand the dunes land to be protected. Four additional sections of land are essential to the completion of the park. There should be restoration of full acquisition authority for the Green Belt area. as originally appeared in the Fithian bill. This would provide needed buffer protection. Second. 200 acres of high wooded dune land. the balance of unit IB. the Glacial Lake Dunes. should be added to the park. Third. Nipissing Dune land. a type of natural land form not now part of the park. should be included in the park lands. Finally. the balance of IA East. which is adjacent to the existing park and which is scheduled to be subdivided into prestige lots. should remain a public recreation area for. the millions of people who live near the park. With these additions. we can preserve the natural areas. broaden recreation areas. and provide for industrys needs. Mr. Speaker. this is probably the last opportunity we will have to preserve this precious national resource for us all.

I rise in opposition to the Ways and Means Superfund tax bill and the DowneyFrenzel substitute. and in support of the DuncanGregg substitute. First. I strongly support reauthorization of the Superfund Program. I believe that one of our top national priorities must be to clean up these abandoned hazardous waste sites so that Americans no longer need to worry about the contents of leaking barrels near their homes or whats buried under the grassy hill their children use as a playground. While I am not happy about each and every provision in H.R. 2817. 1 believe that the bill is a vast improvement over the Superfund legislation which expired at the end of September. HR. 2817 should effectively focus the Governments resources and efforts on expeditiously cleaning up abandoned hazardous waste sites. I do oppose the funding mechanism adopted by the Committee on Ways and Means. however. While the committee may call it by some other name. the plain fact is that the financing package creates a valueadded tax that would fall disproportionately on the poor and lower income Americans. The valueadded tax is one of the most unfair and regressive forms of taxation. Because a VAT shows up as higher prices to consumers. it absorbs a larger percentage of a lower income familys earnings. A VAT especially hurts the unemployed. the elderly. and families who are trying to reach the first rung on the ladder of economic opportunity. I also oppose the DowneyFrenzel substitute. which would dramatically increase the tax burden on the petrochemical industry and basically require only these industries to pay for the bulk of cleanups. despite the fact that they have contributed only a small portion of wastes to these sites. The EPA has indentified more than 4.000 businesses. industries. and government firms as contributors of waste to Superfund sites. Yet. only a dozen petrochemical companies pay alsmost 70 percent of current Superfund taxes. completely out of proportion to the level of hazardous wastes they dispose of each year. Loading the industry up with additional taxes will not get at those companies that illegally dump hazardous wastes. Such action will. however. cripple one of the most crucial industries in our country.162 We all benefit from petrochemicals. While petrochemicals may be generated by December .10. 1985 December. 10. 1985 . CO a specific industry. they areused by practically every industry in this country. from auto producers to grocery manufacturers to the home furnishings industry to clothing manufacturers to cosmetic companies. I believe that it violates any sense of fairness to hold one industry responsible for the disposal methods of thousands of industries. I do intend to vote for the DuncanGregg substitute. While I do not favor an environmental surcharge. I believe that DuncanGregg is the best alternative of the plans from which we have to choose. \x95 I strongly feel that the cleanup of hazardous wastes should be paid for by the broadest based tax of allthe income tax. If a clean environment is one of our top naltional priorities. then we should not be afraid to use general revenues to pay for it. We all benefit from a clean environment and from the products in which petrochemicals are used. I strongly support increased funding for the Superfund Program. which the DuncanGregg substitute ensures. I do have serious doubts as to whether EPA can effectively use $10 billion over the next 5 years. So I am pleased that the surcharge would not go into effect unless the additional money actually can he used to clean up hazardous waste sites. I believe that House passage of the DuncanGregg substitute also will improve chances for final enactment of Superfund legislation. The other body has already gone on record as opposing a valueadded tax. and I think that the DowneyFrenzel substitue will be unacceptable to them. Passage of the DuncanGregg substitute will enable conferees to find an acceptable mix of financing mechanisms to ensure expeditious passage of a final Superfund package. Mr. Chairman. we need to pass a strong Superfund Program. which ensures adequate funding and strikes a balance between environmental needs and economic realities. I believe that our best chance to achieve this most important environmental goal is to approve this legislation with the l)uncanGregg substitute tax package. I urge my colleagues to support the i)uncanGregg substitute and oppose the DowneyFrenzel substitute and the Ways and Means VAT tax bill.\n',rise opposition tax bill substitute support substitute support reauthorization believe top national priority clean abandon hazardous_waste site need worry content leak barrel home s bury hill child use playground happy provision believe bill vast improvement legislation expire end focus government resource effort clean abandon hazardous_waste site oppose funding mechanism adopt committee call other name plain fact financing package create valueadde tax fall poor low income valueadde tax unfair regressive form taxation vat show high price consumer absorb large percentage low income family earning vat hurt unemployed elderly family try reach first rung_ladder economic opportunity oppose substitute increase tax burden petrochemical industry require industry pay bulk cleanup fact contribute small portion waste site indentifie more business industry government firm contributor waste site dozen petrochemical company pay percent current taxis proportion level hazardous_waste dispose year load industry additional taxis get company dump hazardous_waste such action crucial industry country.162 benefit petrochemical_petrochemical generate specific industry areuse industry country auto producer grocery manufacturer home furnishing industry clothing manufacturer cosmetic company believe violate sense fairness hold industry responsible disposal method thousand industry intend vote substitute favor environmental surcharge believe good alternative plan choose feel cleanup_hazardous waste pay broad base tax income tax clean environment top naltional priority afraid use general revenue pay benefit clean environment product petrochemical use support increase funding substitute ensure serious doubt use next year pleased surcharge go effect additional money use clean hazardous_waste site believe passage substitute improve chance final enactment legislation other body go record oppose valueadde tax think unacceptable passage substitute enable conferee find acceptable mix financing mechanism ensure expeditious passage final package need pass strong ensure adequate funding strike balance environmental need economic reality believe good chance achieve important environmental goal approve legislation substitute tax package urge colleague support substitute oppose substitute mean tax bill.\n,99.0,daily,1,0

By far. most of these employees who have either spoken or corresponded with me concerning their problem support the principle of selfdetermination and firmly believe that qualified Indians should be handling Indian Affairs. Yet. the implementation of that policy creates a deadend situation for the career employee who does not enjoy preference under the law. For some. who have sufficient service and age. the option of retirement is available. For others. though. the prospect is. at present. quite bleak. Legislation has been proposed to revise retirement benefits for these personnel and thus create more opportunity for Indian advancement and employment in the affected agencies. There are many who desire to remain in the civil service and who hope for greater assistance in their efforts to obtain employment offering an opportunity for advancement. These employees have been told that the Department of the Interior is working on a placement assistance program. And while most BIA and Indian Health Service employees do seem to have applications out. I have a thick file of letters from employees caught in this situation which casts great doubt on the progress of any outplacement program for these people. whose position. if not unique. certainly approaches that status.

Thank you very much. I appreciate the courtesy. It is so nice of you to let me do this. I know everyone is waiting to offer their amendments. This is leader time. It comes off of the bill. IRAQMr. President. last night. on the heels of two very bloody days in Iraq where 11 American soldiers have been killed. the President and. the Vice President shamelessly decided to play politics. It was another deplorable political ploy from an administration that is growing more and more and more desperate and disconnected. The American people and our brave soldiers deserve better. It seems the President and Vice President have decided to treat the war as if it is a political campaign. Instead of giving our troops a plan for success or answering the serious questions of the American people. they have decided to reignite the RoveCheney attack machine. We are at war. We need a Commander in Chief. not a Campaigner in Chief. We need leadership from the White House. not more White Housewashing of the very serious issues confronting us in. Iraq. This week. Senate Democrats and Republicans. right here in this Senate. voted overwhelmingly to send the President this message: It is time to change course in Iraq. Instead of heeding that call. the White House continues to dodge and to duck the questions of Americans and to smear their opponents. That is not leadership. and. our troops and - the American people deserve better. Here is what Senator CHUCK HAGEL said -Now. who is CHUCK HAGEL? CHUCK HAGEL is a decorated Vietnam war veteran. a man who. in Vietnam. saved the life. of his own brother. Of course. he is also a senior Republican member of the Foreign Relations Committee. Here is what he had to say about the administrations tactics. These are not my words. They are the words of the Senator from Nebraska: Suggesting that to challenge or criticize policy is undermining or hurting our troops is not democracy. nor what this country has stood for. for over 200 years ... . To question your government is not unpatrioticto not question your government is unpatriotic. America owes its men and women in uniform a policy worthy of their sacrifices. He is right. The deceiving. dividing. and distorting must end. Of course. this is the same move we have seen from Karl Rove and DICK CHENEY time and time -again. Whenever their poll numbers sink. they go back on the attack. This time. though. the stakes are too high to let them get away with it. There is more than poll numbers or votes at stake.

I rise once again to express my profound disappointment over congressional indifference to an international agreement of great import. As we near the close of the 89th Congress. the Senate has again failed to ratify the Genocide Convention. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee. after holding initial hearings in 1950. has since refrained from taking any action. The official reticence to reopen debate on this subject is appalling. it is aimost 20 years since the treaty was drafted under United Nations auspices with strong U.S. backing. and yet we have still refused to approve it. * Pending before the House Foreign Affairs Committee is House Resolution 103. which I introduced on January 12. 1965. aimed at putting the House on record as favoring U.S. accession to the Convention. It was my hope that if the House would grant this issue some consideration. it might encourage reappraisal in the Senate. Close to 70 sovereign states have ratified the Genocide Convention. Its purpose is to outlaw group persecution on grounds of race. religion. and national origin. We in the United States have nothing to fear from this agreement. Genocide as such cannot occur in America. Opponents have repeatedly sought to demonstrate through extreme instances how the language of the treaty can be invoked against American citizens. but it is a hollow argument. Ironically. when the Senate originally heard witnesses in 1950. opponents were able to convince the doubters of the contradictory conclusion that the treaty was both harmless and dangerous. I wish to direct the attention of my colleagues to the remarks I made here on the floor last March 24. This was an attempt. through a historical review. to answer the fear and apprehension voiced in 1950 and still prevalent today. The Genocide Convention is not an ideal instrument. because of the weak structure of international law. set against the power of individual sovereign states. enforcement must depend principally upon the will of the contracting parties. Proponents cannot realistically claim that the Convention will end the indignities and prejudice which has afflicted mankind throughout the course of history. Nevertheless. it constitutes one step in the direction of establishing worldwide protections applicable to individuals. It is a method of erecting a consensus of world opinion to which governments and national leaders must pay heed. The intent to destroy an ethnic. religious. or racial group. in whole or in part. is defined as an international crime in the Genocide Convention. It seems to me that the purpose of the agreement is closely attuned to our own domestic structure of law. If the ""understandings"" which the Senate drafted in 1950 are appended to our ratification. as clarification. then there should be no fear that the treaty provisions contradiet or supersede our codes in any manner. Our Nations participation in the 1968 Human Rights Year will seem shallow indeed unless the Senate ratifies this assertion of basic human rights. My bill to establish a U.S. Committee on Human Rights. to prepare for American observance. is intimately tied to Senate action on the Genocide Convention and other pending human rights charters which we have shamefully neglected. The patient and laborious work in behalf of human rights may not attract many headlines. It is obscured by the daily crises which descend upon our official policymakers. This is the great disappointment. I dare say that we cannot afford to dismiss these issues by becoming mesmerized by the abrupt and ceaseless conflicts around the world. It is truly lamentable that the United States. which has always stood for the dignity of the Individual. has failed to act In a practical way to enhance the application of human rights around the globe. Our record on this front stands in bleak contrast to our oftexpressed commitment to the rule of law and ethical conduct. Our indecision on the Genocide Convention is a typical instance. The Senate is obligated to act.\n'",rise express profound_disappointment congressional indifference international agreement great import close 89th fail ratify hold initial hearing refrain take action official reticence reopen debate subject appalling aimost year treaty draft auspex strong backing refuse approve pende introduce aim put record favor accession hope grant issue consideration encourage reappraisal sovereign state ratify purpose outlaw group persecution ground race_religion national origin fear agreement genocide such occur opponent seek demonstrate extreme instance language treaty invoke american citizen hollow argument hear witness opponent able convince_doubter contradictory conclusion treaty harmless dangerous wish direct attention colleague remark make floor last attempt historical review answer fear apprehension voice prevalent today ideal instrument weak structure international law set power individual sovereign state enforcement depend will contracting_party proponent claim end indignity prejudice afflict mankind course history constitute step direction establish worldwide protection applicable individual method erect consensus world opinion government national leader pay heed intent destroy ethnic_religious racial group whole part define international crime seem purpose agreement attuned own domestic structure law understanding draft append ratification clarification fear treaty provision contradiet supersede code manner participation seem shallow ratify assertion basic human right bill establish prepare american observance tie action other pende human right charter neglect patient laborious work behalf human right attract many headline obscure daily crisis descend official policymaker great disappointment dare say afford dismiss issue become mesmerize abrupt ceaseless conflict world lamentable stand dignity fail act practical way enhance application human right globe record front stand bleak contrast oftexpresse commitment rule law ethical conduct indecision typical instance obligate act.\n,89.0,bound,1,0

There is a lot of good in public education today. When we look across our country. just as we see examples of what doesnt workdropout factory schools where kids are falling further and further behind each year. schools that are unsafe learning environments for their kidsjust as we have that. we also have examples of what works. what works with our most atrisk populations in this country showing that every student in this country can learn and can achieve. given the right opportunity and the right school environment. Now. charter schools arent the silver bullet or the solution. but they are a tool in the arsenal of school districts in the States to address the learning needs of all students. Nationally. theres over 5.000 charter schools representing just over 5 percent of all public schools in the country. Many of those charter schools couldnt have gotten off the ground without the Federal startup grant that this bill reauthorizes. Importantly. again because we have examples that this works. this bill. for the first times. allows States to use the money to expand and replicate learning models that work. I point to one in Colorado. the Ricardo Flores Magon Academy. Ninetythree percent free and reduced lunch. 86 percent English language learners. and yet they scored far above the State average in the past 3 years. 95 to 100 percent proficient in math and about 20 percent higher than the State average scorethe State average score that includes wealthy suburban districts as well. Yes. these students can learn. and schools like Ricardo Flores Magon Academy will now under this new authorization have access to expansion and replication money. So. when models workwhether thats a model like KIPP nationally. which has successfully served some of our most atrisk communities. or whether its grassroots efforts across our countrythey will be able to access resources to serve more students and grow or to open up additional branches of the same school. National. State. and local research consistently shows that. yes. not all charter schools work. Some underperform other public schools. Some perform at the same level. and some do better. What we do with this bill is we provide for best practices nationally. Weve learned a lot in the last 10 years with regard to charter schools. We now have some best practices in this bill. like removing caps on the number of charter schools in districts. Through the managers amendment. we ensure that charter schools can participate in food services as well as in transportation services in districts. I want to point out the importance of the transportation because. to make choice meaningful. to add the emphasis to choice. you have to have transportation options to get the most atrisk kids to school. otherwise choice is simply an empty promise. By focusing Federal investments. as H.R. 2218 does. it ensures that we maximize the impact of our limited Federal resources on improving student achievement and reducing the learning gap across the country. To succeed as a Nation. we need to do a better job with our human capital in preparing the next generation of Americans for the next generation of jobs. and this bill will be an important tool in that arsenal.

The rule waives all points of order against the conference report and its consideration. The rule provides that the conference report will be considered as read and provides 1 hour of general debate divided equally between the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on the Budget. . Mr. Speaker. one of the most important things we can do for future generations of Americans is balance the Federal budget. Big government liberals controlled Congress for decades leaving two legacies that plague Americas children. One is a welfare state that impoverishes millions. trapping them in lives of despair. dependent on ineffective bureaucratic institutions. The second is a $5 trillion Federal debt that drags down our private sector economy and forces scarce resourcesscarce Federal resources--to be used to pay interest on debt rather than to solve problems. Last year. Congress passed the first balanced budget in a generation. It was designed to address these critical problems. That balanced budget let the President meet his two major campaign promises from 1992. providing a middle class tax cut and ending welfare as we know it. Finally. it is worth noting that the balanced budget saved Medicare from the bankruptcy that the Medicare trustees now foresee as being just 5 years away. just 5 years away. Mr. Speaker. the President lobbied to kill the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution over in the Senate. President Clinton vetoed the balanced budget that was passed last year by this Congress. He vetoed the middle class tax cut. He vetoed the welfare reform plan twice. He vetoed legislation to protect Medicare. In the words of our dear friends at the Washington Post. he encouraged Medagogues to ""scare Americas senior citizens for political gain."" Now. Mr. Speaker. some might say it is unfair to claim that this veto pattern reflects the Presidents views on these issues. He claims to support a balanced budget. At least two of the eight Clinton budgets released at assorted times over the last year and a half were balanced. at least in a technical sense. The President claims to support tax cuts and has announced a dozen or so ideas for tax cuts over the past 2 years. even some of them in the past 2 weeks. as we have all seen. Of course. the only tax bill that the President has aatually implemented and signed is the largest tax increase in American history. He says he wants to reform the welfare system. The President spoke at length recently in support of the Wisconsin welfare reform plan. Regrettably. the administration has failed to approve the implementation of even that same Wisconsin reform plan. Mr. Speaker. if nothing else. this budget process is showing the American people who is serious about the issues of balanced budgets. tax cuts. and welfare reform. While the President down there at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue talks. the Congress delivers serious. thoughtful. responsible proposals. This budget conference report sets out a 6year budget plan that results in a balanced budget by the year 2002. It accomplishes this in a responsible manner that results in lower deficits. each year than those proposed by the President. The Presidents version of a balanced budget is just the opposite. It is a budget fiction that proposes to dramatically increase spending for 5 years and then slash spending in the last year to balance the budget. That proposal is a joke that mocks the efforts of those who are serious about addressing our chronic budget deficits to save the future of our children. Recent testimony before the House and Senate Appropriations Committees on discretionary spending illustrates the budget games being played by the Clinton administration. In short. the administration budget proposes to increase spending for 1 year in areas such as veterans and space programs. putting off all the cuts to the following years. The administrations own representatives claim that these budget numbers are not serious. that the President only cares about the first years spending proposal and that cuts in the coming years will be abandoned each year as the time comes. In this way. the budget Is scored as reaching balance in 6 years. but the administrations own officials say it will never come to pass. Clearly. the balanced budget proposal offered in the conference report on House Concurrent Resolution 178 is the only serious balanced budget offered to the American people. Of course. the American people deserve more from the Federal Government than a balanced budget. We must address the fact that American families now pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes. 34.2 percent. than at any time in American history. This balanced budget cuts the tax burden on American families by $122.4 billion. This budget also solves the problem of the impending bankruptcy of Medicare which. as I said. the administration has indicated is just 5 years away. It does this by updating a Federal health care program largely unchanged since its creation over three decades ago. By bringing Medicare into the 21st century. Americas seniors will be offered increased choices and the potential to add new areas of coverage. Medicare spending grows by 6.2 percent per year. increasing spending per beneficiary from $5.200 in 1996 to $7.000 in 2002. By addressing this problem in a serious manner. rather than following the Washington status quo bandaid method. Medicare will be healthy for at least 10 years. Mr. Speaker. it is a cliche to say Talk is cheap. The President has proven time and again that talking about balancing the budget. cutting taxes and reforming welfare is easy to do. However. he has also proven that getting the job done is very hard. He has had both Democrat and Republican Congresses to work with. and he has failed miserably with both. There is no other option. On the other hand. the failure to match talk of balanced budgets with action is very expensive. it is very difficult. We are passing a massive debt burden on to the children of this country. and we are not preparing them to pay the bill. Mr. Speaker. I urge my colleagues to support this rule and to support the conference report so that we can move forward and proceed with the concrete actions needed to match words with deeds. Mr. Speaker.

I rise today to recognize Dee Cook. a distinguished leader in my home community of Fort Bend County. Texas. For over 40 years. Dee has given her time and her energy to help with the children of Fort Bend County. in part through her commitment and support of Child Advocates of Fort Bend County. which fights on behalf of abused and neglected children. Dee has served as the grant officer of the George Foundation since 1988. The George Foundation contributes to many worthy causes throughout Fort Bend County. and Dee has played a pivotal role in making sure the generosity of the foundation is directed to causes that help our communities the most. However. it is her generous contributions through the George Foundation to Child Advocates of Fort Bend County that bring me to the floor today. By contributing her time. energy and resources. Dee has enabled Child Advocates to serve over 8.000 children throughout Fort Bend County. Under her leadership. Dee Cook has helped teach the staff and volunteers to be better leaders. more effective program managers. and to achieve the dream of helping the most vulnerable children in our communities in ways we never thought possible 20 years ago. Her contributions are helping children and. in turn. are strengthening our communities and neighborhoods. On their behalf. she has given a voice to those who desperately need one. Dees efforts to build philanthropic leaders do not stop with Child Advocates. She has also started an annual 8month Leadership for Nonprofit Excellence course to teach the rising stars of Fort Bend County the skills they need to harness and grow Fort Bends strong nonprofit community. Most importantly. she has led a cooperative effort between the George Foundation and the Sugar Land Chamber of Commerce to create Youth in Philanthropy. the YIP Team. The YIP Team is 100 Fort Bend County high school juniors and seniors who spend a school year seeing how volunteerism and philanthropy coexist to serve our Fort Bend community. At the end of the school year. the YIP Team will put their knowledge to the test by awarding monetary grants to nonprofitslife changing. indeed. I commend Dee Cook for a lifetime of service to Fort Bend County. I simply want to say to Dee. on behalf of the people of Fort Bend County. thank you. Fort Bend County would not be the county that we all know and love without Dee Cook. In closing.

Senator LEAHY. He is absolutely correct that constitutional amendments should not be rushed. We have taken a long time to get to this point4 years. As a matter of fact. in the Judiciary Committee alone we have heard from 34 witnesses and have had 802 pages of testimony and submissions. In the House. there have been hearings. They have had 32 witnesses and about 575 pages of testimony and submissions. In other words. there have been about 66 witnesses and nearly 1.400 pages of testimony. I commend the report of the Judiciary Committee to anyone who would like a really good read on this entire subject and the reasons why we need a Federal constitutional amendment. The bill passed out of the Judiciary Committee 125. We took our time getting it to the Senate floor to make sure everybody had their say. The distinguished ranking minority member needed additional time to file his comments to the report. That was granted. He did so. We agree there should be adequate time for the debate of this constitutional amendment. but we disagree that there should be a filibuster to use unnecessary time of the Senate. Senator LEAHY talked about a lot of things. He talked about abortion. gun control. a balanced budget amendment and Ronald Reagan. the juvenile crime bill. nursing home fraud. and term limits. I would suggest that we ought to stick to the subject. We all know one good way to defeat a good idea is to talk it to death and threaten to delay other business of the Senate. I would suggest we stick to the exact question before us. and that is whether there should be a constitutional amendment protecting victims of crime. Senator FEINSTEIN and I have laid out the case for this. As I heard Senator LEAHY. there was only one fleeting reference to an argument in opposition. That was that the Senate had acted with alacrity in dealing with the problems that the victims of the Oklahoma City bombing case were suffering because the judge there did not permit the victims to attend the trial. Basically. he gave them a choice. over a lunch hour one day. saying: You can either attend the trial or be present at the time of sentencing and speak to that issue. but you cannot do both. Take your pick. What a Hobsons choice. The prosecutor really could not help advise the victims. Some of them chose not to attend the trial. Others chose to attend. Senator LEAHY is correct about one thing. The Congress did act quickly to pass a law basically telling the Federal judge that they did have a right to attend the trial and the right to *attend the sentencing and to speak at that time and that he should not deny them that right. We passed that. The day after the Senate passed it. the President signed it into law. We were so concerned that these victims of that horrible tragedy have their rights protected that we passed a Federal statuteexactly what Senator LEAHY is suggesting as an alternative to the Federal constitutional amendment that Senator FEINSTEIN and I have presented. What has happened? What has happened is that we are worse off than we were before we passed the statute. The judge did not apply the statute to protect the victims of crime. In effect. what happened was that the defendants right to exclude them. based in the U.S. Constitution. trumped the Federal statute which. of course. is subservient to the Federal Constitution. If that was the basis on which the court ruled. it would have been a correct basis. If he really felt the defendants rights required that the victims not be present in the courtroom. and that those rights are in the U.S. Constitution. then he would be correct that that would trump a Federal statutethe one that the Congress passed. Clearly. the Oklahoma City bombing litigation leaves no doubt about the difficulties that victims face with mere statutory protection of their rights. For a number of the victims. the rights afforded in the act Congress passed in 1997 and the earlier victims rights bill were not protected. They did not observe the trial of the defendant in that case. Timothy McVeigh. because of lingering doubts about the constitutional status of the statutes. The interesting thing is that because that case was later taken up on appeal. the case of these victims. and the Tenth Circuit ruled in that case denying the victims the rights notwithstanding the Federal statute. you literally have a situation in which it would have been better if Congress had not acted by statute because there is now a precedent on the books. This was the first time victims sought Federal appellate review of their rights since the Victims Bill of Rights was passed in 1990. the underlying statute on which the 1997 statute was based. Quoting now from Professor Paul Cassell: The undeniable and unfortunate. result of that litigation has been to establishas the only reported federal appellate rulinga precedent that will make effective enforcement of the federal victims rights statutes quite difficult. It is now the law of the 10th circuit that victims lack ""standing"" to be heard on issues surrounding the Victims Bill of Rights and. for good measure. that the Department of Justice may not take an appeal for the victims under either of those statutes. For all practical purposes. the treatment of crime victims rights in federal court in Utah. Colorado. Kansas. New Mexico. Oklahoma and Wyoming have been remitted to the unreviewable discretion of individual federal district court judges. Professor Paul Cassell of the University of Utah Law School concludes: The fate of the Oklahoma City victims does not inspire confidence that all victims rights will be fully enforced in the future. I . . the Oklahoma City case provides a compelling illustration of why a constitutional amendment is necessary to fully protect victims rights in this country. The sad truth is that Congresss ef-. forts to protect the rights in a very specific case by Federal statute not only didnt protect their rights but made matters worse. The statutory alternative Senators KENNEDY and LEAHY have proposed is not the answer. There has been no refutation of the point .I tried to make in my original 10minute statement that authority after authority after authoritythe Attorney General. the Governors. the attorneys generalhave all said that despite their best efforts. the statutory and State constitutional remedies simply have not worked to provide protections to victims of violent crime. After 18 years of experimenting. of trying. of doing their best. it is obviously now necessary to move forward with the next step. which is to elevate these rights to .the same Constitution that protects the rights of the defendants. Nothing less is going to work. I submit the arguments that Senator FEINSTEIN and I made have not been refuted. If the only response is that we are going to have to take a long time talking about extraneous matters. then my suggestion is that there is no real argument by those who oppose this amendment. There is no real substance to the notion that we shouldnt move forward. I reiterate. I am pleased that Senator LEAHY will encourage all of his colleagues. as I certainly will encourage mine. on both sides of the aisle to support the motion to proceed. We do need to proceed. When we proceed. we can have that debate. Senator FEINSTEIN and I will renew our offer to continue to meet with the Department of Justice to get more suggestions* from them. We have. in fact. incorporated many of their suggestions into the current text of the amendment. But it is time to move on. We cant keep putting itoff. That is why we filed the cloture motion. That is why we want to proceed. I appreciate what Senator LEAHY said. but I suggest that we need to move on with the debate on this amendment. Senator FEINSTEIN and I are prepared to do so.\n'",let take few minute respond distinguished ranking member correct constitutional amendment rush take long time get point4 year matter fact hear witness page testimony submission hearing witness page testimony submission other word witness page testimony commend report like good read entire subject reason need federal constitutional amendment bill pass take time get floor make sure say distinguished rank_minority member need additional time file comment report grant agree adequate time debate constitutional amendment disagree filibuster use unnecessary time talk lot thing talk abortion gun control balanced_budget amendment juvenile_crime bill nursing_home fraud term limit suggest stick subject know good way defeat good idea talk death threaten delay other business suggest stick exact question constitutional amendment protect victim crime lay case hear fleeting reference argument opposition act alacrity deal problem victim bombing case suffer judge permit victim attend trial give choice lunch hour day say attend trial present time sentencing speak issue take pick choice prosecutor help advise victim choose attend trial other choose attend correct thing act pass law tell judge right attend trial right attend sentencing speak time deny right pass day pass sign law concerned victim horrible_tragedy right protect pass suggest alternative federal constitutional amendment present happen happen bad pass statute judge apply statute protect victim crime effect happen defendant right exclude base trump statute course subservient basis court rule correct basis feel defendant right require victim present courtroom right correct trump one pass bombing litigation leave doubt difficulty victim face mere statutory protection right number victim right afford act pass early victim right bill protect observe trial defendant case linger doubt constitutional status statute interesting thing case take appeal case victim rule case deny victim right statute situation well act statute precedent book first time victim seek appellate review right pass underlie statute statute base undeniable unfortunate result litigation_establishas only report federal appellate rulinga precedent make effective enforcement federal victim right statute difficult law 10th circuit victim lack stand hear issue surround good measure take appeal victim statute practical purpose treatment crime victim right federal court remit_unreviewable discretion individual federal district court judge conclude fate victim inspire confidence victim right enforce future case provide compelling illustration constitutional amendment necessary protect victim right country sad truth fort protect right specific case statute protect right make matter bad statutory alternative propose answer refutation point try make original statement authority authority attorney generalhave say good effort statutory constitutional remedy work provide protection victim violent_crime year experiment try do good necessary move next step elevate right same protect right defendant less go work submit argument make refute only response go take long time talk extraneous matter suggestion real argument oppose amendment real substance notion move reiterate pleased encourage colleague encourage side_aisle support motion proceed need proceed proceed debate renew offer continue meet get more suggestion fact incorporate many suggestion current text amendment time move keep put itoff file cloture_motion want proceed appreciate say suggest need move debate amendment prepared so.\n,106.0,daily,1,0

Mr. Chairman. also. an appropriation for a project which had been for some years abandonedbetween New River. in the county of Onslow. and Beaufort. in the county of Carteret. It opens up an inland waterway of vast importance to the people of Onslow and Carteret counties. Therefore. I do not propose to underestimate the importance of that proposition. The bill includes a survey for New Riverthe appropriations under the old project having been somewhat of a failureand upon this survey will be based undoubtedly in the future additional appropriations for New River. in Onslow County. To say the least. it is an important entering wedge. It includes also a survey. which was demanded by the Chamber of Commerce of Goldsboro. in the county of Wayne. for a 3foot depth at low water from Goldsboro to Newbern. in the Neuse River. It includes a surveyin which I am much interested. and which. through the joint efforts of my colleague and myself. was incorporated in this bill for Carrot Island Slough. a most important thoroughfare to the people of Carteret County. Therefore. with all these appropriations in this bill of such great importance to the counties of the Third district. I do not see how. in the discharge of my duty. I can do more than seek to amend the bill. While I am heartily in favor of the Upper Cape Fear appropriation. and the great inland waterway appropriation. and other appropriations for the State of North Carolina. and while I yield to none of my colleagues. all of whom are diligent and able men. in loyalty to my State. at the same time I do not feel I should go so far as to antagonize these various appropriations. of the utmost importance to the people in my district. included in this bill. I feel that this would be unjust to the people I represent and unjust to the committee. I am ready to amend the bill. I am ready to amend it here and to strive to amend it elsewhere. As between my colleagues and myself there is merely a difference of opinion as to the proper method to be pursued. I do not. however. see how. in the discharge of my duty. I can antagonize this bill. I am willing to do everything in my power to amend it and to see that the State of North Carolina gets what my colleagues and I think we are entitled to (and we should have both the Upper Cape Fear and inland waterway appropriations). but it seems to me that antagonism of the pending bill is useless. as well as hopeless. and that the same results can be accomplished by a different method. That. Mr. Chairman. is my position. stated clearly and emphatically. I hope. I shall vote for the amendments of my colleagues. I shall do all in my power to secure both the amendment for the inland waterway and the amendment for the Upper Cape Fear. as I have always done in the past. but when it comes to active oppositfon of this bill. in which are included so mdny other most important projects and new projects. not large in amount. it is true. but great in their importance to the people of the district which I have the honor to represent. it does not seem to me that this would be the right thing to do or that I should go any further than to seek to amend the bill in every proper way in my power.\n',bill include say appropriation project year abandonedbetween county county open inland_waterway vast importance people county propose underestimate importance proposition bill include survey appropriation old project have failureand survey base future additional appropriation say least important enter_wedge include survey demand county 3foot depth low water include surveyin interested joint effort colleague incorporate bill important thoroughfare people appropriation bill such great importance county district see discharge duty more seek amend bill favor appropriation great appropriation other appropriation yield none colleague diligent able man loyalty same time feel go antagonize various appropriation utmost_importance people district include bill feel unjust people represent unjust committee ready amend bill ready amend strive amend colleague difference opinion proper method pursue see discharge duty antagonize bill willing power amend see get colleague think entitle inland_waterway appropriation seem antagonism pende bill useless hopeless same result accomplish different method position state hope vote amendment colleague power secure amendment inland_waterway amendment do past come active oppositfon bill include mdny other important project new project large amount true great importance people district honor represent seem right thing go seek amend bill proper way power.\n,57.0,bound,0,1

We have already come a long way toward our goal of balancing the Federal budget. but reconciliation is the real test of our leadership and our commitment. The spending cuts we will enact will not come without sacrifice from many people. Fortunately. that sacrifice will not go unrewarded. because we intend to cut spending enough to balance the budget. plus provide tax relief to Americans. Today I am pleased to introduce legislation which represents a key portion of our promise to reduce taxes on American families. The American Family Tax Relief Act will provide a $500 per child tax credit to benefit 52 million children in 35 million families nationwide. I am also pleased to say that my legislation is being cosponsored by many of my colleagues. several of which have worked for years to enact a family tax credit. My cosponsors include longtime family credit sponsors Senator GRAMS and Senator COATS. the Majority Leader Senator DOLE. Senator FAIRCLOTH. Senator KEMPTHORNE. Senator COVERDELL. Senator MACK. Senator THURMOND. Senator GRAMM. Senator SANTORUM. Senator SMITH. Senator KYL. Senator THOMPSON. and Senator INHOFE. Mr. President. the Balanced Budget Resolution we passed earlier this year promised that if we do our job. that is if we enact spending cuts sufficient to balance the budget by fiscal year 2002. the economy will reward us with a fiscal dividend sufficient to reduce the tax burden on our citizens by up to $245 billion over 7 years. While many critics have complained that a tax cut of that magnitude is too generous. consider the following facts. Over the next 7 years the Federal Government will take more than $11.4 trillion out of the pockets of American families and businesses. A tax cut of $245 billion is barely 2 percent of that amount. With that $245 billion. we are going to reverse the trend of tax increases which have marked the past several years. reduce taxes on families and businesses. and increase savings and investment. I firmly believe. however. that the priority should be on families. At least 60 to 70 percent of our fiscal dividend should be family friendly. and that is why I am introducing this legislation. Why is family tax relief important. Mr. President? Primarily because todays families with children are overtaxed. In 1948. the average American family paid only 3 percent of its income in Federal taxes. Today. the same family pays over 25 percent. This mounting tax burden is caused by many factors. but particularly damaging are heavy payroll taxes and the eroding value of the personal and dependent exemption. In 1948. the dependent exemption equaled 42.1 percent of per capita personal income. effectively shielding that income from taxation. Todays dependent exemption of $2.500 equals only 10.9 percent of per capita personal income. Congress would have raise the exemption to $9.657 to provide the same benefit as 1948. Payroll taxes hit families with children particularly hard because most of their income comes in the form of wages. Nearly threefourths of all taxpayers now pay more in payroll taxes than income taxes. Another reason to enact family tax relief is that it can make our tax system more progressive and literally remove the IRS from the lives of millions of families. A study by the Heritage Foundation based on IRS and Bureau of the Census data estimates that a $500 per child tax credit would: eliminate all Federal income tax liability for families of four earning between $17.000 and $24.000 per year. cut by 50 percent the income tax burden of a family earning $30.000 per year. cut by 30 percent the income tax burden of a family earning $40.000 per year. cut by 6.8 percent the Income tax burden of a family earning $100.000 per year. and cut by 2.6 percent the income tax burden of a family earning $200.000 per year. Heritage further estimates that the typical congressional district has 117.000 children in families eligible for a $500 credit. meaning $59 million per year in lower taxes which families can spend on their own priorities. Families in the state of Oklahoma stand to gain over $322 million. I have no doubt that those Oklahoma parents can spend that money much more wisely than the Federal bureaucracy. Mr. President. the American Family Tax Relief Act is nearly identical to the family tax credit passed by the House earlier this year as part of the Contract with America. The only difference between our proposals is that my bill has no income limit. Because the President and our Democrat colleagues have shown a near rabid desire to turn any tax cut initiative into a class war. I have no doubt that we will discuss this issue at length in the Senate Finance Committee and on the Senate floor. However. there is absolutely no economic or tax policy justification to limit the family tax credit to certain income levels. The only reasons are political. ones. and even those pale when you realize that almost all children. 94 percent. live in families with incomes below $100.000. I thank my colleagues. and I encourage those who have not already done so to join me in this important initiative. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and additional material be printed in the RECORD.\n',return recess begin long hard budget reconciliation process come long way goal balance budget reconciliation real test leadership commitment spending cut enact come sacrifice many people sacrifice go unrewarded intend cut spend balance budget provide tax relief today pleased introduce legislation represent key portion promise reduce taxis american family provide child tax credit benefit child family pleased say legislation cosponsor many colleague several work year enact family tax credit cosponsor include longtime family credit sponsor pass year promise job enact spending cut sufficient balance budget fiscal year economy reward fiscal dividend sufficient reduce tax burden citizen year many critic complain tax cut magnitude generous consider follow fact next year take more pocket american family business tax cut percent amount go reverse_trend tax increase mark past several year reduce taxis family business increase saving investment believe priority family least percent fiscal dividend family friendly introduce legislation family tax relief important today family child overtax average american family pay percent income federal taxis today same family pay percent mount tax burden cause many factor damaging heavy payroll_taxis erode value personal dependent exemption dependent exemption equal percent personal income shield income taxation dependent exemption equal percent personal income raise exemption provide same benefit payroll_taxis hit family child most income come form wage threefourth taxpayer pay more payroll_taxis income taxis reason enact family tax relief make tax system progressive remove life million family study base data estimate child tax credit eliminate federal income tax liability family earn year cut percent income tax burden family earn year cut percent income tax burden family earn year cut percent tax burden family earn year cut percent income tax burden family earn year heritage further estimate typical congressional district child family eligible credit mean year low taxis family spend own priority family state stand gain doubt parent spend money federal bureaucracy identical family tax credit pass year part only difference proposal bill income limit colleague show near rabid desire turn tax cut initiative class war doubt discuss issue length floor economic tax policy justification limit family tax credit certain income level only reason political one pale realize child percent family income thank colleague encourage do join important initiative ask_unanimous consent_text bill additional material print_record.\n,104.0,daily,1,0

Many special ships. such as nuclear ships. must be repaired in shipyards capable of performing the work. In most all cases that has to be in Navy shipyards. Our nuclear powered and nuclear support ships must not be restricted by such bidding procedures. The amendment also would not permit transfer of work to a naval shipyard away from home port to keep the workload balanced between Navy shipyards. Unscheduled emergency repairs which must be expeditiously accomplished should not be made susceptible to competitive bidding. Frequently. this work has to be accomplished at ports remote from the home port. This amendment restriction would prevent intelligent and logical scheduling of repairs to meet operational deadlines. Mr. President. ships crew accommodations and training would be disrupted and costs increased due to the inability to schedule the location in advance under an impossible bidding procedure. Another adverse impact would be the affect on the morale of a ships crew during repairs. The policy of overhauling in or near home port is of the utmost importance to the morale of the crews of ships. since an overhaul represents a large amount of the time the crew can spend with their families during a tour of sea duty. A transfer of an overhaul to a location as far as 1.000 miles away is most undesirable because of the proven impact on the retention of the crew and the proven loss of life which results from personnel attempting to travel long distances by road in a limited time. I do not believe the record sustains the fact that the Navy has been arbitrary in this matter. and I do not believe the record sustains the fact that they have not handled the matter in the most feasible and logical way possible. We have to give the Navy enough flexibility to do the job and at the place they feel is best to do it. If we do not follow that course it seems to me we are going to handicap the Navy in that respect. Mr. President.

The first Is that this is an absolutely essential declaration. We have now received word from the Soviet Union that Dr. Sakharov has completed his hunger strike. that he has in fact been successful In his strike and has secured the release of his daughterinlaw. Lisa. Alerkseyeva. from the Soviet Union. She will soon. we now believe. be permitted to emigrate to the United States to join her husband. Dr. Sakharovs son. Alexey Semyonov. Sakharov and his wife. Elena Bonner. however. remain confined to the isolated city of Gorki. where the distinguished Nobel laureate Is unable to continue either the scientific work. for which he first gained world reknown or the very important work he has done to defend and advance the cause of human freedom and democratic liberties in the Soviet Union. - I. believe that expressions of support for Dr. Sakharovs strike. which came from throughout the free world during the 17? days of his fast. and which were Preceeded in large measure by the adoption of a resolution In support of the strike adopted in the Senate of the United States. were important and Influential In the decision by Soviet authorities to yield to Andrei Sakharov. It is vital now to- demonstrate that we were not interested merely in the fine point of the Soviet Unions own laws. and the more Important point of Its international -commitments. but were in fact determined to enforce the broader principles of freedom of expression and freedom of movement by individuals. Members of this body will surely want to support the pending resolution. Americans are firmly in support of Dr. Sakharovs right to live. to study. to teach. wherever he may wish to do soand as the resolution states. the Universal Declaration of Human Rights asserts that ""everyone has the right to freedom of movement and residence within the borders of each state"" The Senate believes. in this right. Intends to support it. advocate Its application. for Dr. Sakharov and his family and also for the thousan~ds of Soviet dissidents. and millions of Soviet citizens who desire a better lif e than they are permitted under the totalitarian rulers who dominate that country.

But. say our Democratic friends. while you are speaking of our imports. look at the vast Increase in exports. But exports have nothing whatever to do with bringing in revenue. and I am now speaking of the causes for a depleted Treasury. In the munitions of war there has been an increase. Our increased exports are measured by the toll of death taken by the battle fields of Europe. Our balance of trade boasted about. by the Democratic Party is the balance produced by the awful tragedy of war. I demonstrated this conclusively a few days ago by official figures when I spoke upon ""Battle Field Prosperity."" Our exports to the nations of pence under the present tariff law lave generally decreased qr our Imports have generally increased. This is strongly shown when you compare the figures for 1915. the last year under the present Democratic tariff law. with the figures for 1913. the last year under the Republican tariff. Taking these years for comparison. the following is the result: With Argentina our imports Increased 270 per cent. our exports decreased 4 per cent. With Brazil our imports increased 19 per cent. our exports decreased 12 per cent. With Peru our imports increased 40 per cent. our exports only 4 per cent. With Chile our imports increased 26 per cent. our exports only 7 per cent. With Australia our imports increased 207 per cent. our exports decreased 20 per cent. With China our imports increased 32 per cent. our exports decreased 22 per cent. These figures show conclusively what the present tariff law will do when it is not stimulated by the abnormal demands that :come from tle great tragedy being waged in Europe. But I am not dealing with exports today. I am dealing with the many times repeated assertion that the condition of the Treasury is due to decreased imports caused by the war in Europea statement that the figures that I have given demonstrate to be absolutely without a sladow of foundation in fact. Our Democratic friends say that it is necessary to tax the people to secure money to run the Government because of decreased imports brought about by the war in Europe. The conclusive answer is the figures that I have already quoted. Under the present tariff our ilmports would have to. increase more than a billion dollars a. year over what they Were last year to produce a sufficient amount of revenue to meet the expenses of government. Such a tremendous increase would close. our mills and factories. make us a nation of paupers. and plunge us into poverty and wretchedness beyond imagination. Does tie Democratic Party advocate this plan? Does the Democratic Party advocate increasing imports or direct taxes or a bond. issue to secure money with which to run the Government? Either course is certain eventually to bring us industrial ruin. These figures that I have quoted demonstiate that there were more imports In this country during the last nine months of 1915 than in any other nine months period in our history. except only the nine months prior to the war in Europe. under the present law. These figures tell the entire story. Nothing more can be added. If the same rate of revenue had been imposed il the Underwood law as in the Payne law during the last nine months of 1915. we would have collected $91.656.161 more than we (id collect under the present law. Take this sum and add to it the amount of useless and inexcusable extravagance by the present administration. and you will have approximilately tie present estimated deficit. Or. in other words. by official figures it is shown that not the war in Europe but free trade and extravagance are responsible for our present financial condition. And let it never be forgotten that if the imports amounting to $1.344.140.185 that came Into this country during the last nine months of 1915 to compete with our producers and our laboring classes had paid $91.656.000 more revenue into the Treasury than they did piy. that this amount would not have added a single penny to the price of the goods. as they were sold to the original producer. and the American people would not have been compelled to pay a direct tax to that amount. While the foreigner was selling in our market. lie got the entire benefit of the $91.656.000. It went into his pocket instead of the United States Treasury. and the American consumer paid -just as n~uch for these imported goods as he would have paid if the additional duty had been levied. On the other hand. most of these imports consist of competitive articles that could have been made at home. and if they had been produced at home not only would our own people have had the work and the wages. not only would the money have remained in this country instead of going abroad. not only would we have had both the goods and the money. but the American consumer would undoubtedly have paid less for a large portion of what we buy. and the Treasury would have been enriched by the vast sum of over $90.000.000 and the American people would have been relieved from that much taxation. When you look at these facts and figures you can readily understand the frantic efforts of the majority to keep tile tariff upon sugar. You can understand the sudden conversion of the Democratic Party to a tariff commission that it has so often heretofore condemned and denounced.

I rise in strong opposition to this amendment. To begin with. this amendment creates a major obstacle for parties such as States. municipalities. local entities. and nonprofit organizations from challenging unsound licensing decisions in the courts. It does this by requiring the losing side in these disputes to pay the legal costs. not just of the prevailing party. but for every intervening party as well. Just imagine what this would mean. How could a local beach community risk bringing an action knowing that it may have to pay for its own legal costs. let alone the legal costs of all of the parties in the case. which could include some of the Nations largest oil and gas producers. Without question. this draconian costshifting regime will have a chilling effect on the right of individuals. municipalities. and nonprofit organizations to challenge licensing decisions that could have devastating effects on their communities. Sure. the provision allows the losing party to argue that its position was substantially justified or that special circumstances make such an award unjust. but even meeting that standard could require extensive litigation. This savings provision offers the tiniest of fig leafs. It is clear that the real intent of this provision is to ensure that only the wealthiest members of society will be able to litigate these issues. Second. this amendment is not necessary. Current law already authorizes a Federal court to sanction a party for filing frivolous actions or for engaging in wrongful conduct. Federal rule of Civil Procedure 11 deems every pleading. motion. and any other paper filed by a party in a Federal proceeding to be a certification by such party: that it is not being presented for an improper purpose. that the claims and legal contentions asserted in the pleadings are warranted by existing law. and that the factual contentions made in the pleading have evidentiary support. And should the court find that any of those requirements have been violated. the court may impose an appropriate sanction. including requiring the offending party to pay all of the prevailing partys reasonable attorneys fees and other expenses arising from the violation. In addition. the court. under certain circumstances. may also impose monetary sanctions against a party who violates rule 11. So. in sum. this amendment is simply not necessary. Third. this amendment is not only an affront to the independence of the Federal judiciary. but it could seriously disrupt the ability of the courts to meet its obligations to litigants in other pending matters. The amendment does this by setting hardandfast deadlines that ignore the complexities of the individual case or the courts schedule. And it requires the court to prioritize these actions over all other pending matters before the court. Not surprisingly. the Judicial Conference of the U.S. has long opposed legislative efforts to impose specific deadlines and mandate that certain actions be prioritized over others for some very important reasons. By imposing rigid deadlines. measures such as this amendment undermine the effective civil case management and unduly hamper the courts discretion in managing and prioritizing its case docket. Each case should be considered on its own merits without the imposition of artificial deadlines. Worse yet. this amendment specifically provides that if the district court fails to meet this deadline. the case must be dismissed with prejudice and terminates all rights relating to cause or claim. Just imagine how a defendant could use this provision to its advantage by running the clock through delaying tactics such as employing a multiplicity of procedures and timeconsuming discovery demands. This amendment is antijustice. It must be opposed. I yield back the balance of my time.\n',rise strong opposition amendment begin amendment create major obstacle party such municipality local entity nonprofit_organization challenge unsound licensing decision court require lose side dispute pay legal cost prevail party intervene party imagine mean local beach community risk bring action know pay own legal cost let legal cost party case include large oil_gas producer question draconian costshifting regime chilling_effect right individual municipality nonprofit_organization challenge licensing decision devastating effect community provision allow lose party argue position justify special circumstance make award meet standard require extensive litigation saving provision offer tiny fig_leafs clear real intent provision ensure wealthy member society able litigate issue amendment necessary current law authorize federal court sanction party file frivolous action engage wrongful conduct federal rule civil deem pleading motion other paper file party proceeding certification such party present improper purpose claim legal contention assert pleading warrant exist law factual contention make pleading evidentiary support court find requirement violate court impose appropriate sanction include require offend party pay prevail reasonable attorney_fee other expense arise violation addition court certain circumstance impose monetary sanction party violate rule sum amendment necessary third amendment affront independence judiciary disrupt ability court meet obligation litigant other pende matter amendment set hardandfast_deadline ignore complexity individual case court schedule require court prioritize action other pende matter court oppose legislative effort impose specific deadline mandate certain action prioritize other important reason impose rigid deadline measure such amendment undermine effective civil case management hamper court discretion manage prioritize case docket case consider own merit imposition artificial_deadline bad amendment provide district court fail meet deadline case dismiss prejudice terminate right relate cause claim imagine defendant use provision advantage run clock delay tactic such employ multiplicity procedure timeconsuming discovery demand amendment antijustice oppose yield balance_time.\n,113.0,daily,0,1

Mr. Chairman. this is a good day for the American people. I am pleased to be a Member of the 105th Congress which is about to achieve something for which many of us have fought for a very. very long time. I salute Chairman KASICH and Chairman DOMENICI and all those involved in .these very difficult negotiations. This plan will first and foremost allow for tax relief for all taxpayers in America. There is no doubt that our citizens pay too much for government and keep too little of their earnings for themselves. Hard working people should be allowed to make their own choices about how to spend their hard earned dollars instead of giving them to Federal bureaucrats to spend. I know that the Ways and Means Committee will be working out the details of.that tax relief in the next month or so. but I am very optimistic that there will be real capital gains tax reform and estate tax reform. These two taxes are onerous and counter productive. Relief in these areas will create economic growth which will mean more good jobs and less reliance on government programs. And I am equally pleased that we will be able to improve the lives of families with children by allowing them a $500 per child tax credit. That $500 for each child will mean a lot to families who have many. many uses for that money which they wont have to send to the IRS. Securing Medicare for the next several years is another very important step for the citizens of southern Arizona. This important medical insurance program for senior citizens is on the brink of bankruptcy. With the reforms contained in this plan. we can be sure that Medicare will be kept solvent and available to our parents and grandparents and maybe even to some of us. Mr. Chairman. is this a perfect plan? Quite honestly. it is not. Would I.have preferred more tax relief for our citizens? Yes. I certainly would have. Families without children could use tax relief. Small businesses could use tax relief. Everyone could benefit from lower taxes. Would I have preferred more savings in many programs? I definitely believe there are ways we could have held down discretionary spending levels. But we will have an opportunity to work out some of these differences as we take the steps necessary to turn this plan into legislative reality. But. Mr. Chairman. this is a big step for a Congress and a President that only a short time ago shut down the Government about our disagreements over these issues. Lets take this step and use the accrued benefits as a foundation for future efforts. For future efforts will be needed. As good as this budget plan is. it will not solve the problem in the long term. We already know that in a very few years we will find ourselves in another very difficult situation when we deal with the reality of a.Social Security Trust Fund emptying as baby boomers begin to retire. All the revenues from FICA taxes and the trust fund itself will actually be spent for Social Security recipients instead of masking the deficit as it does today. And the Medicare Trust Fund also will need further work as these new recipients start drawing benefits. Mr. Chairman. the problems we will inevitably face in the years ahead are just some of the reasons I urge my colleagues to support the budget resolution reported by the Budget Committee. This is an excellent opportunity to help the people we represent get out from under the burden of overtaxation and overspending. We need the foundation we are building now for the work we must do later. We must not let the excellent slip away while we await the perfect.\n',say happy speak budget plan lead balanced_budget understatement good day american people pleased 105th about achieve many fight long time salute involve difficult negotiation plan allow tax relief taxpayer doubt citizen pay much government keep little earning work people allow make own choice spend hard earn dollar give federal bureaucrat spend know work detail tax relief next month optimistic real capital_gain tax reform estate tax reform taxis onerous counter productive relief area create economic growth mean good job less reliance government program pleased able improve life family child allow child tax credit child mean lot family many many use money send secure next several year important step citizen southern important medical insurance program senior citizen brink_bankruptcy reform contain plan sure keep solvent available parent_grandparent perfect plan i.have prefer more tax relief citizen family child use tax relief small business use tax relief benefit low taxis prefer more saving many program believe way hold discretionary_spending level opportunity work difference take step necessary turn plan legislative reality big step short time shut disagreement issue let take step use accrue benefit foundation future effort future effort need good budget plan solve problem long term know few year find difficult situation deal reality a. empty baby_boomer begin retire revenue taxis trust fund spend recipient mask deficit today need further work new recipient start draw benefit problem face year reason urge colleague support budget resolution report excellent opportunity help people represent get burden overtaxation_overspending need foundation build work let excellent slip await perfect.\n,105.0,daily,1,0

On April 12. 1980. the Republic of Liberia experienced its first coup detat in its 133year history. During the violent overthrow of the government. President William Tolbert and 27 others were brutally slain and their bodies dumped in an open pit. The insurgency was led by M. Sgt. Samuel K. Doe. a 28yearold member of the Liberian Armed Forces. Although some of the officials of the former Tolbert government have been retained. 91 others were immediately arrested. Despite the pleas of many nations. including the United States. that the trials of these officials be delayed. the new Liberian Government proceeded with military trials of 13 former members of the Tolbert government. The charges against these men were not made clear nor were they permitted to have lawyers. Shortly thereafter they were publicly executed. I understand that there are 80 former officials still being held in the Barclay Training Center in Monrovia. and that some if not all of them have been marked for execution. We cannot help but feel outraged at these actions. In addition to this. however. I feel a personal sense of loss because San Francisco State University. of which I was president. has had particularly close ties to Liberia. Under the auspices of my university. a special program was initiated in 1963. With the assistance of the Agency for International Development. a cooperative educational venture got underway at that time which resulted in the creation of the Monrovia Consolidated School District. San Francisco State University sent professors of education. experienced teachers. to Monrovia where they served as educational advisers and helped train Liberian teachers. At the same time. Liberian teachers came to San Francisco State where they enrolled in intensive training programs. They were a welcome addition to our campus. AID provided the funds for the Americans and the Government of Liberia for its own nationals. The program was operated from 1962 to 1973. Today. the Monrovia Consolidated School District is Liberias most respected school system. During the course of those 10 years. Mr. President. we at San Francisco State. both faculty and students. developed close ties with people in the government and in the educational system and among the people of Liberia. It is. therefore. with special feelings. Mr. President. that I submit this resolution which expresses our concern about Liberia. Mr. President. Liberia has been Americas oldest and best friend in Africa. The United States is responsible for the foundation of Liberia. Its capital. Monrovia. is named after President Monroe in whose administration all this happened. It was settled early in the last century as a haven for freed slaves from this country. and our historical and cultural ties with Liberia have been reinforced by trade and by the experience of thousands of Liberians who have studied in the United States. It is my great hope that this special relationship can continue. Nevertheless. we must express to the new Liberian Government our deep concern about these executions and trials. and the fact that further incidents of this type will seriously affect future relations between the United States and Liberia. Due to the urgency of the situation. I hope that the Senate will act on this measure in a timely fashion. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that a telegram from the European Baptist Federation. addressed to Mr. Samuel Doe. the Chief of State of Monrovia. Liberia. expressing their concern. an editorial from the New York Times of April 24. and an editorial from the Washington Star of April 15. 1980. be printed in the RECORD.\n',today introduce concurrent_resolution express deep concern current situation experience first coup_detat history violent_overthrow government other slain body dump open pit insurgency lead member official former government retain other arrest plea many nation include trial official delay new proceed military trial former member government charge man make clear permit lawyer execute understand former official hold mark execution help feel outraged action addition feel personal sense loss president close tie auspex university special program initiate assistance cooperative educational venture get underway time result creation send professor education experience teacher serve educational adviser help train liberian teacher same time liberian teacher come enrol intensive training program welcome addition campus aid provide fund own national program operate today respected school system course year faculty student develop close tie people government educational system people special feeling submit resolution express concern america old good friend responsible foundation capital name administration happen settle last century haven_freed slave country historical_cultural tie reinforce trade experience thousand study great hope special relationship continue express new deep concern execution trial fact further incident type affect future relation urgency situation hope act measure timely_fashion ask_unanimous consent telegram address express concern editorial editorial print_record.\n,96.0,bound,1,0

On the contrary. we find that as soon as the memorial of Wagoner was presented to this House. we presented to this House. and you voted down by a partisan vote. a resolution to constitute a committee of investigation to go out to the city of St. Louis and take the testimony according to the rules of law and judicial practice. and not delegate harumscarum. flotsam and jetsam notaries public to take all manner of irrelevant testimony and pound it into a record of 2.300 pages. and submit it for our consideration two days before action is taken. It is all very well for the gentleman from Pennsylvania to say that this testimony has been arriving week by week by sections. and the members of his committee are too fair. notwithstanding the partisanship that has characterized them in this contest. to assert that this evidence was ever presented to any member of this House in a readable shape until last Monday morning. True it is that some testimony came here a week ago last Monday and two weeks ago las. Mondaypiecemeal it came. It came in undertakers boxes. it came in every kind of consignment in which it could come. The committee was called together. counsel were brought in. They were compelled to make their arguments before this committee absolutely without an opportunity of investigating the evidence in this case. They were given but two hours to wander aimlessly through this record. without page. some of it. and without an index to facilitate the finding out of the facts. Mornings and sometimes evenings this committee sat listening to the arguments. besides the duty which a member owes to his constituents to be on the floor of the House from 12 oclock in the day until 5 oclock. the hour of adjournment. They had to sit floundering about endeavoring to read some testimony to find the relevancy of any. The argument was concluded. Members of the committee suggested. ""What about a brief?"" The ordinary. generally recognized. precedented practice of this House is that a brief of the evidence should be submitted for the consideration of the comuittee. Ah. no! ""The House is about to adjourn."" ""The Fiftyseventh Congress is about to die."" ""There is no time to submit briefs. with the application of the law and evidence in this case."" ""I mhst get a day in the House."" was the cry. A day in the House for the consideration of this report. even before the counsel had concluded the argument in this case.

S. 655. the Central States low level radioactive waste compact. without final consideration of my amendmentcosponsored by 10 of our colleaguesdealing with campaign finance reform. At that time. it was agreed that for the first couple of months of 1986. the Rules and Administration Committee would be given time to hold hearings in consideration of this legislation. as well as the bills sponsored by the Senator from Pennsylvania. Mr. HEINZ. and the Senator from Maryland. Mr. MATHIAS. It was further understood. that because of the overwhelming vote of 84 to 7. not to table my bill. the Senate was clearly serious about campaign finance reform. Members of this body paid great verbal service to calling for reform of the campaign laws which govern the integrity of our democracy. Yet. out of a desire to have possible solutions carefully weighed through the committee process prior to floor action. the Senate then voted only to symbolically call for reform. In an effort to keep debate completely open for others to add to and strengthen our bill. S. 1806. and in light of the importance of the committee process. I agreed to allow the Central States compact to be approved by the Senate in return for an assurance of committee consideration and the right to have S. 655. which is now a shell of a bill. to remain on the Senate Calendar. Therefore. should a committee proposal not be reported in time for Senate and House action this year. we could bring S. 1806 back to the floor. as an amendment to S. 655. Mr. President. let me commend the chairman of the Rules and Administration Committee for arranging a Quick hearing upon the Senates return in January. Another hearing was held 2 weeks ago. and hopefully. further action will take place very soon. In light of the possibility that no committee recommendation may come forward. or if progress toward such a proposal is not apparent. I think it only fair that I advise my colleagues of my intention to again bring my legislation before the full Senate. I have contacted the majority leader to advise him of my intentions and to ask his assistance in bringing a proposal to the floor.

The common characteristic of these proposals is that they would mandate a balanced budget by statute rather than by constitutional amendment. The proponents of the statutory alternative claim that these measures would achieve virtually the same result as the constitutional approach. while avoiding the delay. difficulty and policy constraints inherent in the amendatory process. On July 13. 1982. Mr. Mathias offered his statutory alternative to Senate Joint Resolution 58. a proposal which in substance practically replicates the pending resolution. In advocacy of his alternative. the Senator stated. Before we amend our organic law. the Constitution. in a manner that seems likely to fall. or at least to require adjustment and tuning. let us do what we can do in a way that we can adjust and tune. The Senator went on to say that. as a general rule. we should resort to the amendment procedures prescribed under Article V only when all other means of achieving a desired goal have been exhaustively explored and rejected. A ugust 3. 1982 In the ensuing debate I joined with my distinguished colleague from Virginia. Mr. HARRY F. BYRD. to remind Senators MATHIAS and BAucus that the Congress had not just ""exhaustively explored"" such a statutory approach. but had in fact previously en. acted such legislation. Public Law 95435. section 7. That law. enacted in 1979 reads. Beginning with fiscal year 1981. the total budget outlays of the Federal Government shall not exceed its receipts. Unfortunately. as Senator MATHIAS now seems to advocate. the Congress chose to ""adjust and tune"" that statute for which Senator BYRD and I so earnestly endeavored. The Congress simply passed the next budget resolution lacking any balanced budget stipulations. Since the succeeding statute has precedence over what was previously enacted. the ByrdGrassley amendment was ""adjusted and tuned"" out of existence. This example illustrates the real inadequacy of any statutory proposal to mandate a balanced budget. No matter what is embodied in the substance of such proposals. whether it be a 60 percent vote waiver as provided in the MathiasBaucus proposal or a 100 percent vote waiver. these statutes may be overturned and nullified by a 51. percent. vote of both Houses of Congress. This was the fate of the ByrdGrassley statute. I submit that all other statutes. no matter how well constructed. will suffer the same unfortunate fate. Therefore. Mr. President. I would urge my colleagues to reject the MathiasBaucus proposal. and any others which would substitute a statute for the constitutional amendment proposed in Senate Joint Resolution 58. Too many of us have worked for too long to see our hopes dashed upon the rocks of the statutory approach once again. I would suggest to Senators MATHIAS and BAUCUs. that if they were to offer this proposal as a supplement rather than as a substitute for Senate Joint Resolution 58 to be used in the interim during the ratification process that it would have my support. and I believe the support of the principal sponsors of this resolution. The statutory implementation of the procedural mechanism provided for in Senate Joint Resolution 58 would allow Congress an opportunity to develop the appropriate legislation that will be so crucial to the success of this effort. The proposal offered by Senators MATHIAs and BAucus might be a very. effective trial balloon for the Congress to adapt to the spending- regimen embodied by Senate Joint Resolution 58. If it is not wholly circumvented it could be of great success in expediting the intended results of the constitutional approach.e\n'",course extensive floor debate engage numerous alternative propose common characteristic proposal mandate balanced_budget statute constitutional amendment proponent statutory alternative claim measure achieve same result constitutional approach avoid delay difficulty policy constraint inherent amendatory process offer statutory alternative proposal substance replicate pende resolution advocacy alternative state amend organic law manner seem likely fall least require adjustment tuning let way adjust tune go say general rule resort amendment procedure prescribe article other mean achieve desire goal explore reject ugust ensue debate join distinguished colleague remind senator explore statutory approach fact act such legislation section law enact read begin fiscal year total budget outlay exceed receipt seem advocate choose adjust tune statute endeavored pass next budget resolution lack balanced_budget stipulation succeed statute precedence enact amendment adjust tune existence example illustrate real inadequacy statutory proposal mandate balanced_budget embody substance such proposal percent vote waiver provide proposal percent vote waiver statute overturn nullify percent vote fate statute submit other statute construct suffer same unfortunate fate urge colleague reject proposal other substitute statute constitutional amendment propose many work long see hope dash_rock statutory approach suggest senator_baucu offer proposal supplement substitute use interim ratification process support believe support principal sponsor resolution statutory implementation procedural mechanism provide allow opportunity develop appropriate legislation crucial success effort proposal offer senator mathia effective trial_balloon adapt spending- regimen embody circumvent great success expedite intend result constitutional,97.0,daily,1,0

Our criminals are not being punished today. Right here in the District of Columbia recently. a couple of thugs ordered a pizza. It was delivered to a vacant house. The thugs killed the young man. The thugs were apprehended. and inside of 24 hours one of the thugs was out on the street on $75.000 ball. I mean. what kind of justice is that? The people were so enraged that they called a press conference and said. ""Is this Justice in America?"" The following day here in Maryland a patrolman picked up a couple of people for speeding. He got out of the car. The two people shot and killed him. They were out on bail in New York. What kind of criminal justice system do we have in America? That is why I say if the American people are truly incensed about what is going on in the streets. on November 6. let us take these people out of public office that are not addressing this issue. I think that is one of the messages we want to get across. Yes. this is going to be resolved when the American people get involved and take their Government back again. I am only one. but I am one. I cannot do everything. but I can do something. and what I can do. I ought to do. and what I ought to do. by the grace of God.

I then called attention to the fact that in 1869 promotion had been stopped in the staff corps of the Army for the sake of reducing them to a size more compatible with the size of the new Army. or rather more in proportion to a peace establishment. That reduction of course has gone on by the natunal process of absorption from casualties . but of course some time or other promotion ought to be restored to the staff corps. I regret I did not at that time know more about the legislation of last June. I think the act then passed was uneven in its operation. It opened up all of the staff corps except threethe AdjutantGenerals. the Pay Department. and the Medical Corps. One thing was then done which I deeply regret. It was my belief. and has been for years. that we ought not to have in time of peace. under a peace establishment. brigadiergenerals at the head of staff corps. but I find on looking over the legislation of last spring all these staff corps. save perhaps two. have had a brigadiergeneral allowed as head of the corps. if we have gone so far to break up the old plan. I see no reason why we should make this exception. and therefore I do not believe this bill in reference to the AdjutantGenerals Department is an improper one--certainly not improper taken in connection with the legislation already had. It is doing no more for the AdjutantGenerals Department than has been done for almost all the other corps. and so far as I am personally concerned I withdraw any objection to the bill. I only think the legislation ought to have been about all the staff corps rather than by piecemeal. as we are having it now and as it has been in the past.\n',bill make criticism much criticism bill criticism general legislation touch ask postponement time look provision call attention fact promotion stop staff corps sake reduce size compatible size new proportion peace establishment reduction course go natunal process absorption casualty course time other promotion restore staff corps regret time know more legislation last think act pass uneven operation open staff corps thing do regret belief year time peace peace establishment brigadiergeneral head staff corps find look legislation last spring staff corps save brigadiergeneral allow head corps go break old plan see reason make exception believe bill reference improper one improper take connection legislation do more do other corps concerned withdraw objection bill think legislation staff corps piecemeal have past.\n,43.0,bound,1,0

The reauthorization of the Clean Water State Revolving Loan Fund Program is an important step to meeting the needs of my communities. Communities in my district like Columbus. New Mexico. a small community of 1700 people which has no clean running water in its community. is desperate for assistance from a program like the one we will authorize today. Sadly. the majority has decided that this poor community should have foisted upon it Federal DavisBacon requirements which were never intended to be applied to nonFederal funds. Instead of helping communities get clean water projects the majority has decided to inflate the cost of these projects with unnecessary provisions that will result in fewer clean water projects. fewer jobs and less clean water. I dont understand how the inclusion. of these provisions that inflate costs will benefit thd small rural communities who can barely afford clean water projects in the first place.

I want to make a few comments. Were I to suggest the abolishment. of some bureau. the workings of which the people I represent were not directly interested in. I might be considered as doing so because of partisanship. All of my constituents are interested in agriculture. Therefore. when I mention agricultural bureaus no one will accuse me of wanting to abolish something just simply because my constituents are not interested in. the project. . I honestly believe that it would be to the best interests of the farmers of the United States if you would abolish threefourths of the bureaus of the Department of Agriculture. I honestly believe that if the President of the United States would take some of these socalled longhaired scientists who draw high salaries from the Government from these various bureaus in the Agricultural Department off of the pay roll and send them back home it would be to the benefit of every farmer in the United States. I wish the Committee on Printing would take proper action now that would not permit another agricultural yearbook to be printed in 10 years. It is a duplication of statistics each year and is a waste. I do not believe there are 20 farmers in any district in the United States who have ever read 25 pages in that big book that is published and republished every year. The basement of the House Office Building is stacked to the ceiling with them. I took occasion the other day to write to one of these scientists in the Department of Agriculture and ask him a few questions. I wanted to get specific answers. He could have answered my questions in one page. He did not attempt to answer them himself. but he turned them over to the head of the department to answer. Why could he not answer when he was in charge of a division? Why did he have to turn it over to the head of his bureau? And it took 15 typewritten pages for that bureau head to answer my few questions. About 14 of those pages are excuses. trying to explain away condemning facts. They are admitting the facts but trying to get around them with excuses and extended explanations. Now. I want to read some of the questions I propounded. and I want you to note the bureaus answers to them. I want to show you just what exists in one bureau as to one agricultural commodity. the Katahdin potatojust one particular item. and show what it has cost the United States.

In the past. we learned. the last 5 years of the buildup before we had summits and before we were really seriously dealing with the Russians and arms control. we had to have this buildup because we were behind. Because we were behind. we had to spend money to catch up so that the Soviets would be interested in negotiating with us. Now. of course. the Soviets have amply demonstrated an interest in negotiating with us. and I might add they had always had that interest. Anytime a nation has 10.000 nuclear warheads aimed at them. which is the number the Soviets have had aimed at them since 1981. they are interested in arms control for lots of obvious reasons. But now that they are. the budget request is justified not to get them to the table. but to keep them at the table. In the immortal words of Rosanne Rosanadanna. ""It is always something."" with this administration. If it is not to get them to the table. it Is to keep them to the table. The most fundamental understanding of this budget requires that one of its major components. the increase in strategic systems. is the most ridiculous.

We are confronted with a real administrative problem as to whether or not a nonresident. for instance. who has paid a tax in another jurisdiction. should file a return or an affidavit to show that the tax has been paid there. Obviously. it is the only thing that you can do. The question has been raised that it is unfair. It was raised with respect to the people who live over in Arlington County. over 10.000 of them. who live over there and work here. They pay an income tax to the State of Virginia. Normally a question rises why should they make an affidavit to the District of Columbia or why should they have to submit an additional return. We do not know of any way to meet that problem except to make them do it. Now the answer is that Virginia does it. There are people who live in the District of Columbia who work over in Clarendon and Arlington in Virginia. They pay taxes over there or they pay taxes here since this is their residence. What does the State of Virginia do? It says. ""You will have to prove it because you have raised this income over on the Virginia side."" The same is true of Maryland. Maryland says. ""All right. you say you live In the District of Columbia. but you work in Chevy Chase or in Hyattsville or out on Bladensburg Road. You get your income in Maryland and you say you are paying an income tax to the District of Columbia. prove it."" So they have to file a statement over there. So the gentlemen who would somehow protect those who live within the environs of Washington from filing an additional return. have it in their own State. It is going to be proposed that a mere filing of an affidavit that a tax has been paid in another jurisdiction is enough. That would not be fair. A man might actually pay $1 in the State of Utah or the State of Michigan or Florida. when as a matter of fact he owes $100.

It places the authority of the Commander in Chief in difficulty in prosecuting whatever force structure we have there in the course of the national interests of this country.
